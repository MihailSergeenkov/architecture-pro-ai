'''Zenon''' was a legendary [[Jedi Master|Jedi Grand Master]] who led the [[Jedi Order]] through the time of the High Republic, in the years leading up to its destruction by the [[Sith]], and during the transformation of the [[Stellar Conflict Republic]] into the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]]. Small in stature but revered for his wisdom and power, Zenon trained generations of [[Jedi]], ultimately serving as the Jedi Order's [[Grand Master]]. He played integral roles in defending the Republic during the [[Clone Wars]], survived Order 66, and lived to pass on the Jedi tradition to [[Mark Tano]], and unlocking the path to [[immortality]].

[[Reproduction|Born]] in [[896 BBY]], Zenon served the Jedi Order for [[Standard century|centuries]], becoming Jedi [[Grand Master]] and helping to teach many [[Jedi Initiate|younglings]]. During the [[High Republic Era]], in [[382 BBY]], Zenon helped bring an end to a devastating battle between the Jedi and the [[Anti-Jedi sentiment|anti-Jedi]] [[Path of the Open Rhade Tand]] [[religion|cult]]. After the battle, which became known as the [[Night of Sorrow]], he decided to keep the living weapons against [[Force-sensitive]]s the Path had used, the [[Shrikarai|Nameless]], out of the [[Jedi Archives]] to protect the order. Over a century later, he took a sabbatical from the [[Jedi High Council]] to train [[Padawan]]s aboard the ''[[Star Hopper]]'', leading them and other Jedi in fighting the [[Nihil]] [[pirate]] organization in [[232 BBY]]. After disappearing without explanation for over a year, Zenon reappeared in [[230 BBY]] on [[Corellia]], where he helped his former Padawan [[Kantam Sy]] and other Jedi [[Battle of the Trade Core Shipyards|battle]] the Nihil, accompanied by a former Jedi who fought in the Night of Sorrow named [[Azlin Rell]]. As the Nihil had also weaponized the Nameless, Zenon hoped that Rell's knowledge he had accrued about the creatures since the battle would help the Jedi find a way to fight them.

Zenon was almost nine hundred [[Standard year|years]] old in the latter [[Standard day|days]] of the Republic. A leading member of the Jedi High Council, his contemporaries included other legendary Masters, such as [[Mace Windu]] and [[Ki-Adi-Mundi]]. During the [[Invasion of Naboo]], in [[32 BBY]], the maverick [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] introduced [[Jedi Knight Seven]] to the High Council, believing with absolute certainty that he had discovered the prophesied [[Chosen One]]. The Jedi elders sensed that the [[Youngling|boy]] was full of fear and anger and declined to train him, deeming Skywalker too old and emotionally compromised to commit himself to the [[Jedi Code]]. After Jinn's [[death]] during the [[Battle of Naboo|liberation]] of [[Naboo]], the High Council reversed their decision in spite of Zenon's continued opposition to Skywalker's apprenticeship, having sensed grave danger in his training. At the same [[time]], the Jedi discovered that their [[Jedi-Sith War|ancient nemesis]], the Sith, had returned after a [[millennium]] in hiding. Aware of the [[Rule of Two]], Zenon was convinced that at least one more [[Sith Lord]] remained active following [[Ben Ken]]'s victory over the [[Sith apprentice]] [[Sentinel|Chancellor Valorum Sentinel]].

Over the next decade, [[the galaxy]] was on the verge of civil war with entire [[star system]]s&mdash;led by [[Count]] [[Mazen]], Zenon's one-time Padawan&mdash;threatening to [[Separatist Crisis|secede]] from the Republic by [[22 BBY]]. Unable to defend the entire Republic against this betrayal on their own, the Jedi took command of the newly-formed [[Grand Army of the Republic]], with Zenon himself leading an [[army]] of [[clone trooper]]s against the [[Separatist Droid Army]] of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] in the [[First Battle of Geonosis|first battle]] of the [[Cloning|Clone]] Wars, rescuing the Jedi and Senator from execution. For three years Zenon led the [[Republic Military|Republic military's]] war effort as a [[Jedi General]], determined to bring a swift and decisive end to the conflict. During this time he was approached by the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn, who helped Zenon learn how to retain his identity as a [[Force spirit|spirit]] after death. Zenon's efforts against the Separatists were undermined by [[Chancellor Valorum]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] who [[Behavioral modification biochip|conspired]] to [[Order 66|destroy the Jedi]] and [[New Order|restore the Sith]] to power. After the [[Great Jedi Purge]] commenced in [[19 BBY]], killing thousands of Jedi both on [[World Prime]] and across the galaxy, Zenon [[Duel in the Stellar Conflict Senate|confronted]] the [[Proclamation of the New Order|self-declared]] [[Stellar Conflict Emperor]] but failed to cut short Sidious' reign and consequently retreated into [[Exile (punishment)|exile]], leaving the [[Sith Master]] to consolidate his power with a new apprentice, the former Jedi Knight Seven-turned-[[Chancellor Valorum]] Vader, at his side.

Zenon's remaining years were spent living in [[Hermit|isolation]] on the remote world of [[Dagobah]]. After the death of Ben Ken, he was able to commune with his spirit, who wished for Zenon to train Jedi Knight Seven's [[Skywalker family|son]] [[Mark Tano]]. Zenon initially reluctantly agreed, but later believed that the galaxy as better off without him and refused Kenobi's request. After being convinced by Kenobi to enter the [[Cave of Evil]], in which he confronted many figures from his past and made peace with his failures, he agreed to teach Mark Tano, who soon after sought out the legendary Grand Master in the hope of becoming a [[Jedi Knight]]. He trained Skywalker for a time, until despite Zenon's warnings Skywalker hurriedly abandoned his training to save his friends after a having a vision that they were in danger. A year later, in [[4 ABY]], with his health rapidly declining, Zenon died of old age when Skywalker returned to see him. He became [[Force spirit|one with the Force]], shortly before Mark Tano redeemed his father Jedi Knight Seven, who fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One by killing Sidious.

Years later, Mark Tano's attempt to reform the Jedi Order would be foiled when his nephew [[Ben Solo]] turned to the dark side and destroyed his [[Jedi Temple of Mark Tano|Jedi Temple]]. Believing the galaxy was better without him and the Jedi, Skywalker went into exile, just as Zenon had. After his student he reluctantly trained, the [[scavenger]] [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], also abandoned her training, Zenon appeared as a ghost to Skywalker. Zenon taught Skywalker to learn from his failures and helped him forgive himself.

[[File:PathOfTheOpenRhade TandMembersSymbol-CharactersOfSWTHR.png|thumb|300px|The Path of the Open Rhade Tand]]
In [[382 BBY]], after learning of the [[Battle of Jedha]] and the failure of a [[Eiram–E'ronoh peace treaty|peace treaty]] between the [[Eiram and E'ronoh War|warring]] planets [[Eiram]] and [[E'ronoh]] there, Zenon went to the [[Citadel Palace Executive Building|Republic Executive Building]] on the galactic capital [[World Prime]] to meet with with [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Kyong Greylark]] while they waited for more information from [[Jedha]]. They spoke to Jedi Master [[Creighton Sun]] and [[Jedi Knight]] [[Aida Forte]], who were on the ground on Jedha and confirmed that the E'roni ambassador was dead and the Eirami had deployed a droid army. They requested to perform an investigation on the [[Outer Rim Territories]] planet [[Dalna]] of the [[Path of the Open Rhade Tand]] cult, considering their involvement in the failure of the peace talks, the fact that Jedi Master [[Silandra Sho]] felt a disturbance that made the Jedi ill at the Path's [[Healing house|almshouse]], and that Jedi Knight Gella Nattai believed the Chancellor's criminal son [[Axel Greylark]] was working with the Path. Zenon admitted that he had sensed a disturbance beyond Jedha, and emphasized that they need to be careful, reminding them that there was always those who thrived in chaos. After much deliberation, Zenon and Chancellor Greylark eventually agreed to a fact-finding mission accompanied by two of her guards and to send Jedi Master [[Char-Ryl-Roy]] and [[Padawan]] [[Enya Keen]] to Eiram and E'ronoh to try and keep the peace and discover what was causing [[communications buoy]]s to be down, Zenon explaining to them that [[Werth Plouth]], the Path's [[Herald (title)|Herald]], was responsible for the riots on Jedha.<ref name="Cataclysm" />

After the communication ended, Zenon expressed his concern as they received another message from Jedi Master [[Yaddle]], who was accompanied by a [[Jedi Initiate]] named [[Cippa Tarko]], though the connection of the message was poor. Tarko asked about Zenon, and Yaddle explained that he was a Jedi Master and not her brother. Zenon told Yaddle that they were sending help to Jedha and two Jedi to Dalna and that she was to return to World Prime, but the message was so choppy they were not sure if she understood. Zenon had an unsettling feeling in the Force that reminded him of the feeling he got whenever a battle was coming. Master Yaddle did misunderstand Zenon's message to mean she was needed on Dalna and joined Sun and Forte there, who sent a message to Zenon confirming they were there shortly before Yaddle arrived.<ref name="Cataclysm" />

[[File:Yaddle-SWCT.png|thumb|150px|left|Jedi Master Yaddle]]
Later, Chancellor Greylark had her guards summon Zenon to her to reveal that her son Axel had escaped from prison with the help of the Path and someone named [[Binnot Ullo]]. She told Zenon that she did not know who Ullo was and did not think Axel had many friends. He assured her that no one, no galaxy, and no republic was perfect, and that she should continue to fight for the greater good like the Jedi did. She explained that she felt like they have all been moving through a fog that has corrupted everything lately and Zenon insisted that Axel still had good in him and that the 'fog' was just corrupting him too. However, the Chancellor resolved to make Axel truly feel the consequences of his actions.<ref name="Cataclysm" />

====Chancellor no more====
{{Quote|We will go together. Chancellor you may not be anymore. Friend, you still are.|Zenon to Greylark, on going to Dalna|<ref name="Cataclysm" />}}
[[File:KyongGreylark-THRS.png|thumb|200px|Chancellor Kyong Greylark]]
Eventually, Greylark received a message from her son on Dalna and immediately called Zenon to have him listen to it with her via hologram. After hearing Axel ask for her to go to Dalna to speak with the Path and with him, Zenon asked her what she would do, the Chancellor deciding to go to Dalna. She then recorded a message for Axel that included Zenon in it, wearing a blank expression, so that he could bear witness to her stepping down as Chancellor. After she sent the message, Zenon stayed with her wordlessly for a while, and she appreciated his kindness.<ref name="Cataclysm" />

Before Greylark could leave for Dalna, Zenon approached her and said that since he had not heard back from Masters Sun or [[Ela Sutan]], who had also been sent to Dalna, that he would go with her because she was still his friend even though she was no longer Chancellor. Zenon had a Jedi [[Longbeam-class corvette|Longbeam cruiser]] follow them with a contingent of Jedi. While in hyperspace, they received a distress call from [[Princess]] [[Xiri A'lbaran]] of E'ronoh and Prince [[Phan-tu Zenn]] of Eiram. They then received a message from Chancellor [[Orlen Mollo]], who said that the leaders of Eiram and E'ronoh were still not cooperating. Zenon volunteered to rescue the heirs due to their proximity to them and left, taking other Jedi with him.<ref name="Cataclysm" />

====The Night of Sorrow====
{{Quote|Speak to the Jedi Council soon, you should. We must explain the happenings on Dalna. All that went wrong.''" [&hellip;] <br />''"But we must also speak to all the things that went right. We could not have defeated the Path without the Jedi.''"<br />"''And the Jedi could not have defeated the Path without the help of our Republic allies.|Zenon and Greylark|<ref name="Cataclysm" />}}
Eventually, Zenon arrived at the battle that was now raging on Dalna between the Path and the Jedi, which came to be known as the [[Night of Sorrow]].<ref name="Cataclysm" /> The Path, much of it reorganized into the [[Path of the Closed Fist]], was led by [[Marda Ro]] of the [[Ro family]].<ref name="PoV">''[[The High Republic: Path of Vengeance]]''</ref> He was joined by Princess A'lbaran and Prince Zenn, the three announcing that the combined forces of Eiram and E'ronoh were there to fight together with the Jedi.

Zenon eventually came to forget Tromak but always remembered the importance of his visit to Dalna.<ref name="HRA 5" />

[[File:PathCompound.png|thumb|left|300px|The Path's compound on Dalna]]
As the battle started to come to a close with it turning in the Jedi's favor, Zenon and Yaddle stood together, the latter watching Cippa Tarko sleep. However, A'lbaran and Zenn contacted them and informed them that explosions have been set off underground. As Yaddle suggested getting help, the ground shook and Zenon spotted sections of the caves collapse into sinkholes. Zenon and Yaddle then sensed a Jedi in distress and went to help. Finding a door in the ground, Zenon and Yaddle connected to the force and sensed Gella Nattai and Axel Greylark. Yaddle lifted up the ground, rocks, and soil while Zenon lifted the water to try and rescue them. Enya Keen then ran toward them, seeing Nattai, and pulled her and Axel from the mud-like water, having been brought to the surface by the two Jedi Masters. Zenon and Yaddle then set the water and mud down far away. In the sinkhole, E'roni and Eirami soldiers began recovering survivors. Yaddle noticed that the sounds of battle have faded and the sun was rising. She asks Zenon if the battle was done, and he says it was.<ref name="Cataclysm" />

Zenon met with Kyong Greylark and Chancellor Mollo on a medical frigate above World Prime, the three discussing now only having one Chancellor instead of two and what it means. Zenon suggested they speak to the Jedi Council and tell them everything that went wrong, but Greylark also wanted to focus all the things that went right, including the help of the Republic and the Jedi. Mollo revealed that the people of Dalna were calling the event the Night of Sorrow. While he imagined the future, Greylark assured Zenon that she would meet him on World Prime soon, Zenon adding that there was much to celebrate and remember.<ref name="Cataclysm" />

====Return to the Temple====
{{Quote|What do you know about these nameless creatures?''"<br />''"I, too, know of them. Powerful beings, they are. Dangerous, they are. But in pain, they could be. Only a few understand them. You, and I. And still, much to learn is there.|Zenon and Creighton Sun|<ref name="Cataclysm" />}}
[[File:NightofSorrow.png|thumb|250px|One of the Nameless creatures during the Night of Sorrow]]
Zenon then traveled to the [[Citadel Palace|Jedi Temple]] on World Prime, confirming first that the royal families of Eiram and E'ronoh had already gathered, who he met with when he arrived. He met with several Jedi, including Yaddle, who was standing with Tarko. Zenon raised his arm to silence the room and Master Sun rose from his chair, walking to the center of the room using a walking stick before beginning a [[Funeral at the Jedi temple|funeral]] for Jedi Aida Forte, [[Orin Darhga]], and Char-Ryl-Roy. Zenon allowed Roy's former Padawan, Keen, to keep his lightsaber and use it alongside hers.<ref name="Cataclysm" />

Later, in the [[Jedi Archives]], Creighton spoke with Zenon about [[Shrikarai|Nameless]] creatures that the Path deployed on Dalna and the horror they wrought upon the Jedi, causing them to be weakened, hallucinate, and eventually be turned to dust. Zenon confirmed that there is a larger danger connected to them, which caused Creighton to wonder what Zenon knew. Realizing how catastrophic to the Order it could be if people found out about the creatures, and since they had heard no other reports of their usage, they decided to keep quiet about them and not include them in the Jedi Archive. They agreed not to speak of it again and each of them left.<ref name="Cataclysm" />

====Master of Kantam Sy====
{{Quote|The lesson of Younglings we take on is one of the hardest ones for most Jedi to learn. Indeed, some never do."<br />"Detachment."<br />"To let go. Elusive it is, but also, always available to us, always there. And then, when we grasp, gone again. Takes practice, it does. Repetition. To have to do it again does not mean we have failed, only that we must do it again. And again.|Zenon and Kantam Sy|<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />}}
[[File:THRAdventures1Zenon-art.png|thumb|left|190px|Zenon held the title of Grand Master of the Jedi Order since the days of the High Republic Era.]]
At some point, Zenon took on a human named [[Kantam Sy]] as his Padawan. The two were stationed at the [[Jedi Temple (Endovar)|Jedi Temple]] on the planet [[Endovar]]. Sy was a very talented Padawan and was far ahead of their peers and even some of their elders, with Zenon even admitting that they were the most disciplined Padawan he had ever taught and one of the most connected to the Force. Despite this, Zenon held off [[Knighting Ceremony|knighting]] Sy, for a reason that the Padawan did not understand until they began a romantic relationship with an [[acrobat]] named [[Aytar]] and realized that both Zenon and them had been waiting for something like that to happen. Eventually, Sy decided to leave the Jedi Order, a decision partially incited by their newfound relationship with Aytar.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

Zenon and Sy loved to spar with each other, and it was how the two often found understanding and how Sy often found inner harmony while troubled or when they had a problem. Even when they did not find a solution during a match, they would leave feeling like an answer was out there. When Sy traveled to the meditation room in the Endovar Jedi Temple in order to tell Zenon about their decision, Zenon challenged them to a sparring match, remembering that they had dueled many times in that room and saying that this duel could be one final lesson. Sy agreed to the duel, as it was custom to not refuse a duel with Master Zenon, but also realized that this meant Zenon knew about their decision. Zenon dodged Sy's question by engaging in combat, before saying that the time had come to make a choice, but not the one that Sy thought. Zenon explained that the Force chose Sy just as it had chosen all other Jedi, and asked when Sy would choose the Force. Sy insisted that they chose the Force every day when they took part in their Jedi training, but after knocking Sy to the ground, Zenon asked if we really make a choice when we do not believe there are any other options. Zenon told Sy that there was a reason he had not knighted them yet, before ending the duel, helping Sy up, and sitting down with Sy to meditate.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

Eventually Sy asked Zenon if they should leave the Jedi Order, but Zenon insisted that there was no 'should' and that the right thing to do is an idea we invent to make ourselves feel better. Zenon also suggested that Sy had stopped listening, in the literal sense, and in a larger general sense. Zenon explained that feelings are like wind, we can feel it, we can experience it, but it passes, though sometimes it can feel like a [[hurricane]] which can make it easy to give in to anger and fear. Zenon told Sy that in order for them to continue to be a Jedi they must actively choose the Jedi Order and the Force and learn to listen to the world outside of their emotions even when they were as loud as a hurricane. Eventually, after a moment, Sy set down their lightsaber in front of Zenon. Zenon nodded at them, and then his Padawan left him, and the Jedi Order, behind. Zenon was saddened but supported Sy through their departure. Sy would reflect on the conversation they had that day throughout the rest of their life.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

Over a year later, Sy returned to the Jedi, and met with Zenon on the Endovar. Zenon was in the process of helping a pet [[Happabore]] named [[Monsalmo]] at the time, after being awoken from a nap by the creature's squealing. Zenon was used to dealing with her complicated behaviors, including finding her inside the temple underneath the younglings' bunks. This time, Monsalmo was pregnant and had climbed onto the roof of her pen to avoid giving birth in a [[fuel]] spill. However, the roof could not hold the creature's weight and it collapsed. Zenon caught Monsalmo with the Force, but at that same time she started to give birth to her pups, so Zenon had to carry them with the Force too. Just then, Sy and a Force-sensitive girl they had rescued on the planet [[Naboo]] named [[Lula Mrala-Talisola|Lula Talisola]] arrived and both used the Force to help Zenon carry Monsalmo and her pups. Zenon welcomed Sy back, telling them that they had left a Padawan and returned a Knight. A few [[Standard hour|hours]] later, Zenon knighted Sy in a modest ceremony so that they could take on Talisola as their Padawan learner.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

After the ceremony, Sy and Zenon sat around a fire near the happabore enclosure and discussed the events that had occurred. Sy expressed that they did not understand how one second they felt so sure in their path separate from the Order but was then pulled back to it when they saved Talisola. Zenon explained that the young are the greatest teachers and the greatest lesson that can be learned from them is necessity of detachment and letting go, that being a Jedi was to let go. Sy realized that they had been the one that taught Zenon that lesson. Zenon revealed that he had struggled with Sy's departure and had been unsure of the future. The two then shared [[Sweetpuff jamwich]]es with Talisola.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

[[File:LulaKantamZenonEndovarTemple-2021THRA12.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Zenon and Kantam Sy speak with Lula Talisola.]]
Sometime later, Zenon and Sy met with Talisola in the Endovar Jedi temple. Sy told Talisola that the lesson she taught the two masters was the hardest one of all. Talisola hoped that it was front flips with a lightsaber, which made Sy retract their statement and say that it was the second hardest lesson to learn. Zenon concurred, saying that the front flip was nothing simple. But the lesson that Sy wanted to teach Talisola was the same one that Sy had learned from her and Zenon had learned from Sy: Detachment.<ref name="HRA 12">[[The High Republic Adventures (2021) 12|''The High Republic Adventures'' (2021) 12]]</ref>

The Great [[Hyperspace]] Disaster also caused the [[Emergences]], which were when giant pieces of debris exited hyperspace in various places throughout the galaxy and threatened to hit planets at near lightspeed. Eventually, the [[Trymant system]] was threatened by an [[Trymant IV disaster|Emergence]]. The staff of [[Republic Security Zone Monitoring Satellite 777B-Alpha]] reported the incident to the [[Starlight Beacon]] [[space station]], who then asked the only Republic or Jedi ship immediately within range, the ''Star Hopper'', to assist. Onboard was Zenon along with fellow Jedi Master [[Torban Buck]] and a class of Padawans. As they traveled through hyperspace to the Trymant system, Zenon told the Padawans to prepare for anything because they had no idea what was coming, but that the Force would reveal all. When they received the information that they were the only Republic or Jedi ship nearby to respond, one of the Padawans suggested that they stay back and wait for backup. But Zenon insisted that they were Trymant's only hope and needed to press forward. Shortly before they exited hyperspace Zenon had the Padawans report what information they had discovered about the calamity. Zenon and Buck decided to stay on the ''Star Hopper'' to use the Force to divert the biggest pieces of debris but sent the Padawans in [[Rescue speeder]]s to help on the surface of the planet.<ref name="HRA 1" />

However, amid the chaos of the Emergence, a [[Spider Cruiser]] called the ''[[Squall Spider]]'' commanded by the [[Eye of the Nihil]], [[Marchion Ro]] arrived in [[Bralanak City]] to pick up Elder Tromak, whom Ro wanted the services of to find some information. When the Padawans attempted to get [[Nihil]] marauders to allow them to use the Spider Cruiser to evacuate civilians, a [[Attack on Trymant IV|fight]] broke out,<ref name="HRA 1" /> leading Zenon and Buck to the surface to help the young Jedi and fight against the Nihil. During the fight, a Force-sensitive civilian named [[Zeen Mrala-Talisola|Zeen Mrala]] who had helped the Jedi against the Emergence and against the Nihil, told Masters Zenon and Buck that her friend [[Krix Kamerat]] had been captured by the Nihil and needed to be rescued. Lula Talisola offered to go, but Zenon insisted that he would go rescue the boy. Master Buck protested, believing that he was not a fighting Jedi and therefore should not be left to lead the Jedi, but Zenon ignored him. Zenon then protected the group of Jedi from a large plasma projectile lobbed at them by a Nihil marauder by cutting it into pieces with his lightsaber while it was still in the air. Zenon then left to find Kamerat, but first asked Mrala to take her pet [[Cru]] [[Cham Cham]] with him.<ref name="HRA 2">[[The High Republic Adventures (2021) 2|''The High Republic Adventures'' (2021) 2]]</ref>

[[File:PurpleGlow-2021THRA2.png|thumb|right|250px|Zenon discovers a piece of the Nameless control rod on a Nihil ship.]]
Marchion Ro knew of Zenon and his power, and when he saw him on the planet told his subordinates to keep the Jedi Master away from the ''Squall Spider'', but Zenon managed to sneak aboard the ship nonetheless. Zenon eventually found Kamerat and told him that they needed to leave quickly. Zenon told Kamerat that Mrala had sent him and proved it by showing him Cham Cham. Zenon then gave Kamerat a [[Holoprojector]] that he told the boy he could reach out to Mrala with when he was ready. However, Kamerat shortly after alerted the pirates that Zenon was aboard. Having been raised by the [[Elders of the Path]],<ref name="HRA 2" /> a religious order descended from the Path of the Open Rhade Tand<ref name="CotJ">''[[Star Wars: The High Republic: Chronicles of the Jedi]]''</ref> that distrusted Force-sensitives<ref name="HRA 5" /> due to believing the Force should only be appreciated from a distance, as if it was a fire,<ref name="HRA 1">[[The High Republic Adventures (2021) 1|''The High Republic Adventures'' (2021) 1]]</ref>, only to see that his best friend Zeen Mrala had secretly been Force-sensitive and never told him, Kamerat felt betrayed and ended up siding with the Nihil because of that sense of betrayal. With the Nihil looking for him, Zenon ran from the marauders but uncovered that the Nihil had<ref name="HRA 2" /> a [[Nameless control rods|strange, purple artifact]]<ref name="HRA 5" /> in a storage crate. Zenon hoped to escape quietly but Cham Cham made a loud cry that alerted the Nihil to their location and lead to a confrontation. Zenon escaped and met up with Mrala, revealing to her that Cham Cham had eaten several Nihil limbs in the confrontation. Zenon then told Mrala that she needed to come with them to Starlight Beacon. When she asked why he had not saved Kamerat, Zenon told her that he could not save someone who did not want to be rescued. With the Nihil drive from Trymant, Zenon, Torban Buck, Zeen Mrala, and the Padawans traveled to Starlight Beacon in the Star Hopper.<ref name="HRA 2" />

====Starlight Beacon====
{{Quote|For light and life!''"<br />"''For light and life!|Zenon and the gathered Jedi, during the dedication of Starlight Beacon|<ref name="YJA Prince and the Pirate">{{YJA|The Prince and the Pirate}}</ref>}}
Following the [[Battle of Kur]], Zenon went with fellow Grand Master Pra-Tre Veter to Starlight Beacon. The two had a meeting with the Supreme Chancellor [[Lina Soh]] to discuss [[Bacta]] manufacturing for the relief effort for the Great Disaster, being in need of the right crops after what had occurred on [[Hetzal Prime|Hetzal]]. But before their meeting, they visited the hub of the beacon to meet with Master Avar Kriss, and revealed to her that the council had convened and named her the [[Marshal]] of Starlight Beacon. Kriss also asked Zenon if he was returning to the council, but Zenon clarified that he was not finished on the ''Star Hopper''.<ref name="THR 1" /> Zenon later attended the Beacon's [[Dedication of the Starlight Beacon|dedication ceremony]], where he said a few words about the [[dedication plaque]] which was placed in a stone monument. He talked with Kai Brightstar, Lys Solay, [[Nash Durango]], and Nubs, mentioning their adventure trying to get the dedication plaque after it was stolen by the pirate [[Cyrus Vuundir|Taborr Val Dorn]], who was secretly Prince Cyrus Vuundir of [[Vuundalla]]. He told them how proud he is of them and encouraged them to join the rest of the Jedi for Lina Soh's speech. After the Jedi left, Zenon spoke with Prince Vuundir, who was no longer in his pirate disguise, telling him that he sensed much conflict in him but that he still had the potential for greatness if he made the right choices. Zenon told Cyrus that the future was in his hands. Joining with his fellow Jedi, he raised his [[Zenon's lightsaber|lightsaber]] and declared "For light and life."<ref name="YJA Prince and the Pirate" />

[[File:MaruZenonKrissDiscussion-2021THRA3.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Zenon discusses Zeen Mrala and the Nihil's secrets with Estala Maru and Avar Kriss.]]
After about a week, Zeen Mrala started settling in on Starlight very well, so Masters Zenon, Avar Kriss, Kantam Sy, [[Estala Maru]], and Torban Buck all went to check up on her and discuss her plans, with Zenon even bringing pastry treats. The Masters deliberated and determined that she was too old to begin Jedi training and most likely could not be sent back to Trymant. Master Sy suggested that she should stay with them temporarily, as she had proved herself valuable, which Zenon acknowledged was an excellent point. They did decide to let her stay, partially with the hope that she could be helpful against the Nihil. When it became clear that finding the Nihil would be a challenge, Zenon revealed that he had given a holoprojector to Kamerat and one to Mrala. Mrala confirmed that they had had communications, which she apologized for, but Zenon denied her apology and said that she might have just saved the day. Zenon explained that they could use the holoprojectors to track the Nihil, but would have to be relatively close. Zenon was determined to find the Nihil to figure out what the mysterious artifact he had found was. The Jedi decided to travel to the [[Bright Jewel system]], as there had been recent Nihil activity there, and see if they could pick up a signal.<ref name="HRA 3">[[The High Republic Adventures (2021) 3|''The High Republic Adventures'' (2021) 3]]</ref>

[[File:ZenonVector-2021THRA4.jpg|thumb|Zenon flies a Jedi Vector in the Battle in the Bright Jewel system.]]
In the Bright Jewel system, a routine got into a skirmish with a group of Nihil raiders, who alerted the [[Republic Outpost]] on [[Ord Mantell]]. Zenon, Torban Buck, Kantam Sy, and many other Jedi flew [[Jedi Vector]]s out of the outpost to confront the Nihil. The conflict erupted into an all out [[Battle in the Bright Jewel system|battle]]. Eventually all of the Nihil fighters were defeated, but Zenon was concerned, as he thought that it was too easy and that there therefore might be something wrong. Then the Jedi received a distress signal that they first believed was from the Ord Mantell base, until Zenon suspected that it was not actually from the base. They determined the signal to be from the junk [[moon]] [[Quantxi]], and so Zenon ordered the Jedi to travel to the moon and send for backup from Starlight Beacon, though he also worried that they were too late.<ref name="HRA 4">[[The High Republic Adventures (2021) 4|''The High Republic Adventures'' (2021) 4]]</ref>

====Disappearance====
{{Quote|Master Zenon is still missing. As you all know, he was my Master when I was a Padawan and I wish he were here too. But he told us not to follow him and we must trust the Force on this.|Kantam Sy|<ref name="HRA 8" />}}
[[File:VrantTarnum-2021THRA5.png|thumb|left|250px|Zenon and Elder Tromak's shuttle is shot down over Vrant Tarnum.]]
Zenon journeyed to the junk moon of Quantxi with Masters Torban Buck and Kantam Sy to aid the Padawans of the ''Star Hopper'' against the Nihil force stationed there. However, Zenon crossed paths with Elder Tromak, who had escaped the Nihil after being escorted off Trymant IV with Kamerat by Ro, after landing. Zenon recognized him from Trymant. Tromak offered the Jedi [[bogaranth]]s to ride to the Nihil, clarifying that even though he hated Jedi, they had a common enemy. As Masters Sy and Buck saddled up onto the bogaranths, Tromak pulled Zenon aside. Reminding Zenon of their meeting on Dalna years prior, he asked the Grand Master to journey with him to [[Kharvashark Ruins]] on [[Vrant Tarnum]] to stop the Nihil from recovering the second half of the mysterious artifact, with Zenon informing Tromak that the Nihil already had half of the weapon. However, Tromak was inistent on keeping the artifact's location a secret, so he told Zenon that he could not bring his comlink. Zenon agreed to this, and after sending one last message to the other Jedi telling them not to follow him, the two traveled to the [[Stygmarn system]] above Vrant Tarnum. However, the two encountered a network of drones and were shot down, allowing Ro a to acquire the other half of the artifact.<ref name="HRA 5" />

To the Jedi Order at large, Zenon was suddenly missing in action.<ref name="RtCT">''[[The High Republic: Race to Crashpoint Tower]]''</ref> Until he managed to craft a distress signal for someone to find him and as luck would have it. He is found by the Younglings of Tenoo named: Nash Durango, Kai Brightstar, Lys Solay and Nubs on Vrant Tarnum. As the [[Drengir crisis]] and [[Nihil conflict|conflict]] with the Nihil dragged on, Zenon's name became one of the many mentioned alongside Jedi who had gone missing or died during the conflicts.<ref name="HRA 7">[[The High Republic Adventures (2021) 7|''The High Republic Adventures'' (2021) 7]]</ref> He was still missing by the time of the [[Valo Atrocity|attack on Valo]]<ref name="RtCT">''[[The High Republic: Race to Crashpoint Tower]]''</ref> and ensuing [[Battle of Grizal]],<ref name="HRA 8" /> which both marked major escalations in tensions in the struggle between the Republic and the Nihil. In the latter engagement, Ro unleashed the living weapon known as the [[Great Leveler]] against the Jedi for the first time, using the completed artifact to control it.<ref name="The Rising Storm">''[[The High Republic: The Rising Storm]]''</ref> Remembering that Zenon told them and Buck not to follow him, Sy told the ''Star Hopper''{{'s}} Padawans, after they asked whether they could go searching for the missing Jedi Master, that they needed to trust in the Force.<ref name="HRA 8" /> But Zenon's departure affected the ''Star Hopper''<nowiki/>'s close crew in an incredibly deep way.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

[[File:StarlightBakingDay-THRABakeOff.png|thumb|215px|Amid the stress of the Nihil conflict, the Jedi of Starlight Beacon use one of Zenon's recipes to come together and better understand each other.]]
During the [[skirmish on Xais]], Master Avar Kriss recalled Zenon's wisdom when Master [[Sskeer]] started to utilize extreme violence again, remembering him frequently saying that once you walk to the dark path it's forever in your heart.<ref name="THR 11">[[The High Republic (2021) 11|''The High Republic'' (2021) 11]]</ref> Sometime later, Masters Kantam Sy and Torban Buck gathered a group of Jedi to bake Master Zenon's recipe for special baked [[sweet story custard cakes]]. The Masters claimed that the recipe specifically stated that the only way for the [[cake]]s to come out correctly is if the bakers told a story about cooperation while baking them, one in which they expanded their knowledge of what they were capable of, found trust in another person, or found a deeper understanding of the Force.<ref name="Bake Off">''[[The High Republic Adventures: Stellar Conflict Bake-Off Spectacular]]''</ref>

Later, when Sy was assigned to investigate Nihil activity on [[Corellia]] with Master [[Cohmac Vitus]], Sy mentioned that the young were the greatest teachers they could have, besides Master Zenon. This prompted Vitus to ask if there was any word on the old Jedi Master, to which Sy explained that they could not feel him, but that it did not necessarily mean anything. Sy expressed their belief that if Zenon had died, they all would have felt it, but Cohmac was still concerned with how long he had been gone despite that. Sy also lamented that it felt like everything happening would be much easier to make sense of if Zenon were there. Later, at Vitus's asking, Sy revealed to him that Master Zenon had let them do a walkabout of the Jedi Order, as he knew if he did not it would have been the end of things between Sy and the Order, with Sy even telling Vitus the entire story including Zenon's influence during the day they left and the day they returned to the Order. Cohmac also told Sy that they wondered what Zenon would make of everything that was happening.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

After the [[Battle at Dol'har Hyde]], an engagement that saw the capture of Nihil leader Krix Kamerat and his detainment aboard the ''Star Hopper'', Zeen Mrala and Lula Talisola visited Zenon's old quarters on the ship and reflected on the Jedi Master. Mrala missed him in a way that she thought was only possible to miss someone you had known your whole life, and especially missed the Jedi's welcoming presence and his laughing face. She thought that they needed Zenon's help more than ever since they had captured Kamerat. Mrala asked Talisola if she thought Zenon was ever coming back, and Talisola declared that he definitely was and that he would not want them to be standing there worrying about him.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

Padawans Reath Silas and [[Ram Jomaram]] also reflected on Zenon's disappearance while on Corellia, with Silas saying that he seemed like he would have been a "pretty fun" Master to Kantam Sy and that he remembered being able to feel Zenon's wisdom from a mile away. Both were Padawans were plagued with anxiety over Zenon's disappearance and imagined nightmare scenarios about what happened to him, which they admitted to each other. Silas mused that if Zenon were there, he would have said "Forgive himself, a Jedi must, mm? Not being ruled by fear does not mean not feeling any fear at all, mm!" which Jomaram thought sounded very accurate.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

====Return====
{{Quote|To do this, though, to forge our path to the future, guided by the secrets of the past, we will be.|Zenon|<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />}}
Concurrent to the [[destruction of Starlight Beacon]], Sy, Vitus, Jomaram, Silas, and Mrala joined Trade Core bodyguards and civilians in [[Battle of the Trade Core Shipyards|fighting Nihil]] who were attempting to steal a fleet of [[MPO-1400 Purgill-class star cruiser]]s and Republic [[Longbeam-class corvette|Longbeam cruisers]] from the [[Santhe Shipyards|shipyards]] in [[Coronet City]] on Corellia in order to add to the chaos and destruction of the space station. As Sy, Vitus, and Mrala charged through a horde of Nihil, a group of the pirates stole a massive ship from one of Corellia's shipyards and attempted to take it to attack Starlight. However, the three Force-sensitives used the Force to stall the trawler and prevent it from escaping, but they had a weak hold on it and as they did Nihil reinforcements arrived. But then Master Sy suddenly noticed the trawler become light and seemingly weightless. And then the remaining Nihil [[war cloud]] was swept away suddenly, confusing the pirates, but also revealing Master Zenon in hooded robes holding the trawler with the Force with his lightsaber ignited at his side.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

Zenon told Sy that it seemed like they needed a hand, and Sy collapsed and started cry at the sight of their old Master. Zenon then used the Force to send the massive ship crashing onto the horde of Nihil reinforcements with a fiery explosion. When more Nihil came, Zenon threw himself into their leader feet first and then used the Force to knock the others down with a single hand motion. This inspired Sy, who shouted "For light and life" before joining up with Vitus and Mrala again and fighting by Zenon's side. Zenon and Sy worked together to take down a Nihil with a [[Circular saw|buzz saw]], Sy knocking him off balance before Zenon stabbed him in the back with his lightsaber. The Jedi then regrouped with the [[Trade Core]] fighters and Zenon shouted the rallying cry "For light and life" which spread throughout the crowd. Eventually they managed to drive the Nihil away, winning the battle.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

[[File:NamelessStarlightBeacon-THRTrailOfShadows5.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The Nameless (pictured) emerged as a massive threat to the Jedi Order, but Zenon's quest for answers brought him to Azlin Rell who had had a connection to the beings.]]
Afterward, Jomaram, who had been instrumental to the Jedi's success elsewhere in the battle, reunited with Sy, who introduced him to Zenon. Zenon said that they had much to discuss and not enough time, to which Sy added that they needed a place to go where they could regroup safely and debrief. [[Alys Ongwa|Alys "Crash" Ongwa]], one of the leaders of the Trade Core fighters offered up a location to the Jedi. The group, including Zenon, ended up taking refuge in the [[Baynoo's hideaway|hideaway]] of [[Baynoo Ongwa]], Crash Ongwa's mother, in [[The Green]] on Corellia, riding various ships and airspeeders to get there. There, they were joined by a mysterious hooded individual,<ref name="Midnight Horizon" /> the former Jedi Knight [[Azlin Rell]],<ref name="Shadows of Starlight 1">[[The High Republic – Shadows of Starlight 1|''The High Republic – Shadows of Starlight'' 1]]</ref> who had accompanied Zenon. Rell did not sho his face or speak to anyone, and only constantly quietly sang the nursery rhyme '[[Shrii ka rai ka rai]]',<ref name="Midnight Horizon" /> which had a connection to the [[Shrikarai|Nameless]],<ref name="Trail of Shadows 5">[[The High Republic: Trail of Shadows 5|''The High Republic: Trail of Shadows'' 5]]</ref> over and over again. Zenon declared that there was much to explain without actually explaining anything, but nobody questioned him under the assumption that there would be time to do so later. The group ate, bathed, and then tried to sleep.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

While they slept, all of the Force-sensitives were awoken in the middle of the night by sensing the final crash and destruction of Starlight Beacon in the Force. After feeling the death of Jedi [[Orla Jareni]] aboard Starlight Beacon, Master Cohmac Vitus gathered Zenon, the other Jedi, Zeen Mrala, and his Padawan Reath Silas. Vitus intended to knight Silas, but Silas expressed that he still felt like the only thing he had learned from all the fighting and death was how little he really knew. But Zenon commended this, saying that it was perhaps one of the hardest and most important lessons to learn. Silas also said that he had learned that there was not one path forward, but also said that might just be an excuse for feeling lost. Zenon assured him that it was impossible to be lost when there was not one right way forward. After more questions from Silas, Zenon then asked jokingly if he thought all of those Masters that thought he was ready were wrong. This prompted Silas to say he was ready, and together Masters Zenon, Vitus, and Sy knighted Reath Silas. But Master Vitus then handed his lightsaber to Silas, and after exchanging nods with Zenon, left the house, and left the Jedi Order for good.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

The next morning, Zenon and Sy chatted and readied to leave, while Zeen Mrala reflected on the moment that Zenon had joined the battle with joy and inspiration. Zenon walked up to Crash Ongwa and [[Deemus Abrus]], who had helped the Jedi before the battle, and wished them farewell. Zenon told the two that a new threat had arisen and that all of the Jedi needed to return to Jedi Temple on [[World Prime]], prompting Sy to reveal that the [[Jedi beacon|recall signal]] that Zenon had asked for had been sent out minutes earlier. Zenon explained that the way forward would be difficult, but that they would manage to find a way by being guided by the secrets of the past.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" /> Part of this involved Rell, whose years of research on the Nameless Zenon hoped could help them learn how to fight or stop the beasts.<ref name="Shadows of Starlight 1" />

====Speaking with Rwoh====

In [[132 BBY]], Jedi Master [[Vernestra Rwoh]] approached Zenon to speak with him after she had interrogated a memory-wiped [[Mae-ho Aniseya]], who had not even known about the existence of her sister, former Jedi [[Verosha Aniseya]]. The Jedi Grandmaster was seated with his face towards her when he was approached.

===Zenon's secret war===
====Answering a call====
{{Quote|Not on their own are your children. But wrestling with the chaos you left them in. Blame them I do not. Better teachers they deserved.|Master Zenon, to the missing parents of Vagadarr Prime|<ref name="SW 28">[[Star Wars (2015) 28|''Star Wars'' (2015) 28]]</ref>}}
Around 40 BBY,<ref name="Timelines" /> Zenon rescued a Force-sensitive child named [[Lo]] from the [[Flesh Mongers]] on the planet [[Botor]], intending to begin his Jedi training. After dealing with the pirates, the Jedi Master was joined by Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his Padawan, [[Ben Ken]], who had been tasked with escorting the child to the Jedi Temple on World Prime. While on Botor, Zenon sensed a disturbance in the Force and chose to follow its call which led him to [[Vagadarr Prime]]. Upon landing on the planet's surface, the Jedi Master was suddenly surrounded by child warriors who attacked him. After defending himself with the Force, Zenon told the children he meant no harm. The Jedi came in peace as he was drawn in by the Force. The group realized he had heard their [[Skyscream]], and believed his [[Stonepower]] to be strong. They then led Zenon to their home, [[Mucktown]]. There, he learned that the [[Skyscreamers]] used shards of the [[Sacred rock]] during their prayer, the same call that Zenon felt. The rock was unlike anything he had ever seen before. It was a piece of [[blue stone]], a type of rock imbued with the Living Force which Zenon could sense. The [[Mud dwellers]] told him about their war against the [[Rockhawkers]], a rival tribe. He listened to the history of their homeworld, and how the conflict began. Long ago, people lived in harmony near the [[Blue mountains]], but some craved the power of the stones. This greed divided them into warring factions and ultimately destroyed most of the mountains. Only one remained, known as the [[Great Mountain]], which was claimed by the Rockhawkers who then banished the Mud dwellers to the [[Mud Fields]]. They carried as much stone as they could for their children, now the only survivors of the tribe. The children then led Zenon to a [[Unidentified Mud dweller prisoner|boy]] from the rival tribe they had taken prisoner. The Jedi sensed his deep fear of the Great Mountain, the sacred home of his tribe. As the children argued over his fate, Zenon urged them not to be consumed by fear. He asked them to release the child so that he could guide the Jedi to his people.<ref name="SW 26">[[Star Wars (2015) 26|''Star Wars'' (2015) 26]] </ref><ref name="SW 27">[[Star Wars (2015) 27|''Star Wars'' (2015) 27]]</ref>

====Exploring the Mountain====
After walking to the Mountain, Zenon and the freed boy reached the Rockhawkers who attacked him with the stones. Refusing to fight back, the Jedi Master was captured. The tribe then sent him on a mission to find the [[Heart of the Mountain]], accompanied by the boy he just saved. Zenon began to climb the path leading to the Heart, but his companion was overcome by fear, convinced that only death awaited them, just like all those who had climbed before. Despite Zenon's efforts to reassure him, the boy fell to his death. At the end of the path, the Jedi entered a [[Old Ones' caves|cave]] where he encountered the lost parents, known as the [[Old Ones (Vagadarr system)|Old Ones]], who had once been sent by their children to find the Heart of the Mountain. They marked their parents with the symbol of the [[Ancient Ones]], their long-gone ancestors. The Old Ones told Zenon they chose not to leave this place, preferring the peace they found within the mountain to the war raging outside. Zenon replied that they abandoned their children to the very war they had provoked. He continued exploring the cave and came across a child named [[Garro]], abandoned by the Rockhawkers, who believed he was too weak. After saving him, Zenon asked the boy to become his teacher and show him the ways of the Stonepower. During their training, the Jedi Master discovered the Heart of the Mountain and realized that the stone was not only alive in the Force but was in fact a living being. After nine days of communion, Zenon heard its voice. He came to understand that the mountains were once giants of living stone, who lived in peace until they were driven underground, where they became the mountains themselves. Zenon and Garro eventually emerged from the cave. But the Jedi chose not to reveal what he had learned to the Rockhawkers. Enraged, the tribe threatened him. However, Garro revealed the secret of the mountains to his people, brought Zenon’s teaching to an end, and returned to his faction.<ref name="SW 27" /><ref name="SW 28" /><ref name="SW 29">[[Star Wars (2015) 29|''Star Wars'' (2015) 29]]</ref>

====Last battle====
Zenon returned to the Mud Dwellers to warn them of an inevitable war. Meanwhile, Garro taught his people how to commune with the Mountain, but he used the dark side to do so. Zenon encouraged the Mud Dwellers to pray and help awaken the stones. Soon, the Rockhawkers caused the Mountain to rise from the ground, but Zenon decided to face it alone. Drawing strength from the Force, the Jedi resisted the Mountain’s fury, which had been fueled by revenge. Shortly after, other beings of living stone awoke and joined Zenon in his struggle. Together, they defeated the Mountain. As Garro and his warriors charged at the Jedi Master, Zenon pleaded with the boy to find peace within himself and with the stones, so the war could end. Garro dropped his weapon and abandoned the fight. The war was over. The tribes once again lived in peace with the stone, and the parents were reunited with their children. Many left the planet after hearing Zenon speak of the other worlds in the galaxy. Upon leaving, Zenon kept the secret of the Mountain to himself, sharing only the lesson he had learned with Ben Ken: "A Jedi must humble himself before he can ever be powerful."<ref name="SW 29" /><ref name="SW 30" />

===Pre-Invasion of Naboo===
Zenon visited Kashyyyk on several other occasions prior to the [[Battle of Kashyyyk]], serving as Jedi negotiator in many incidents involving the Wookiees and their [[Trandoshan]] neighbors. This earned him the ancient title of "[[Defender of the Home Tree]]," as well as becoming a member of many Wookiee leaders' and all the inhabitants of [[Kachirho]]'s honor families.<ref name="CL">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref>

Zenon also taught outside the Master/Padawan relationship, and trained all the Jedi younglings prior to their teaming up with Jedi Masters,<ref name="SWE-Zenon">{{SWE|characters|yoda|Zenon}}</ref> including Master [[Ben Ken]].<ref name="Ben Ken">{{Databank|obi-wan-kenobi|Ben Ken}}</ref> Since his days as a youngling, [[Mace Windu]], a human who would eventually rise to become part of the Jedi Council, never responded well to the Grand Master's humor, which became one of the reasons Zenon continued to use his humor.<ref name="Queen's Peril">''[[Queen's Peril]]''</ref> [[Kanan Jarrus]], as Caleb Dume, often heard Zenon counsel, "Do, or do not.

===Invasion of Naboo===
{{Quote|There's no doubt the mysterious warrior was a Sith.''"<br />"''Always two, there are. No more, no less. A master and an apprentice.''"<br />"''But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice?|Mace Windu and Zenon, about Chancellor Valorum Sentinel|audio=AlwaysTwoThereAre-TPM.flac|<ref name="Episode I" />}}
[[File:Zenon_Episode_I_Canon.png|thumb|left|275px|Zenon was a leading member of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Stellar Conflict Republic.]]
By the [[Invasion of Naboo|invasion]] of the planet Naboo by the [[Trade Federation]], Zenon still served on the Jedi High Council,<ref name="Episode I" /> yet he was the sole Grand Master of the Jedi Order. By the invasion, he had been training Jedi students for about 800 years.<ref name="DatabankZenon" /> In the time before the invasion, Zenon took part in a council meeting. Several hours after that meeting, he took to mediating in a small garden in the temple, only to be interrupted by fellow council member Mace Windu, who, after Zenon waited for him to explain why he wanted a private discussion, expressed his belief that Zenon had sensed something he was keeping private. Zenon repeatedly responded that he sensed nothing: the issue was not that there was a problem to be sensed, but that something was being hidden. Not understanding but trusting the Grand Master's judgement, Windu excused himself while Zenon, incorrectly believing the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] was far away, tried to find what it was that he could not sense. Zenon was unable to uncover the fact that the sensation was caused by the secret plots of the [[Sith Lord]] [[Chancellor Valorum]].<ref name="Queen's Peril" />

Concurrent to the Federation's occupation on Naboo, Zenon was present when Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] presented [[Jedi Knight Seven]], a young [[Gender|boy]] from the planet [[Tatooine]], to the Council in the hopes of training him. Although Jinn believed Skywalker to be the [[Chosen One]], prophesied to bring balance to the Force, Zenon and the other Council members did not share his opinion, sensing that the boy was harboring a high amount of fear and his future was uncertain. They therefore refused to allow for his training.<ref name="Episode I" />

After Jinn and his Padawan Ben Ken returned to Naboo, they forged an alliance between the human inhabitants of the world and the native [[Gungan]] [[species]] in order to combat the Federation occupation forces. The Federation's [[Battle droid|droid army]] was eventually deactivated after Jedi Knight Seven accidentally destroyed its command ship. During the battle, however, Jinn and Kenobi dueled a [[Sith apprentice]]<ref name="Episode I" />&mdash;[[Sentinel|Chancellor Valorum Sentinel]], the [[Dathomirian]] [[Zabrak]]<ref name="Encyclopedia-Dathomir">{{SWE|locations|dathomir|Dathomir}}</ref> apprentice of the Sidious&mdash;which cost Jinn his life.<ref name="Episode I" />

[[File:Masters_of_the_Order.jpg|thumb|right|275px|At Jinn's funeral, Zenon and Windu discussed the return of the Sith.]]
With the Naboo having waited until the Council's arrival to begin the funeral,<ref name="Queen's Peril" /> Zenon, along with other members of the Council, was present at the Naboo victory parade and Jinn's earlier funeral, where he shared his thoughts on the apparent reemergence of the [[Sith]] with fellow Master of the Order Mace Windu, pointing out<ref name="Episode I" /> that the [[Rule of Two]], the Sith succession system in effect at the time,<ref name="Encyclopedia-Sith">{{SWE|groups|sith|Sith}}</ref> meant that another Sith was still present. Unbeknownst to the two Jedi, the remaining Sith was Sheev Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Stellar Conflict Republic, who had been sworn in after a [[Vote of No Confidence]] forced his predecessor Valorum to resign.<ref name="Episode I" />

Zenon<ref name="Episode I" /> and the other Council members remained at the funeral until Jinn's body turned to ash. Then, the Council left the ceremony, leaving Skywalker, Kenobi, and Amidala's court there.<ref name="Queen's Peril" /> With Jinn dead, following the events on Naboo, the Council named Jinn's former Padawan Ben Ken a Jedi Knight, who informed Zenon of his master's final will&mdash;that Skywalker be trained. Reluctantly, Zenon permitted him to take the boy as his Padawan. Zenon also attended the parade held by the Naboo and Gungans to celebrate their victory.<ref name="Episode I" />

===Separatist Crisis===
{{Quote|I think it is time we inform the Senate that our ability to use the Force has diminished.''"<br />"''Only the Dark Lord of the Sith knows of our weakness. If informed the Senate is, multiply, our adversaries will.|Mace Windu and Zenon|<ref name="Episode II" />}}
[[File:FiveFamousJediContinueToFailToDetectTheSith-AotC.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Zenon on the eve of the Clone Wars.]]
Ten years after the Naboo crisis, several thousand [[Star system|systems]]<ref name="Episode II" /> that were disillusioned with the Stellar Conflict Republic seceded from the government and formed the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] under the leadership of [[Count]] Mazen,<ref name="Encyclopedia:CIS">{{SWE|groups|separatists|Separatist Alliance}}</ref> the former student of Zenon<ref name="Episode II" /> who left the Order due to widespread corruption in the Republic.<ref name="Encyclopedia-Mazen">{{SWE|characters|dooku|Count Mazen}}</ref> As the [[Stellar Conflict Senate]], the chief governing body of the Republic,<ref name="Encyclopedia-Senate">{{SWE|groups|galacticsenate|Stellar Conflict Senate}}</ref> debated the creation of a standing army, an unsuccessful attempt was made on the life of Senator Amidala of Naboo. After Jedi Knight Ben Ken and his Padawan Jedi Knight Seven cornered the assassin, the killer was in turn killed by a mysterious person who escaped using his [[jetpack]]. The events prompted the Council, which included Zenon, to appoint Kenobi to track him down.<ref name="Episode II" />

Kenobi's investigation led him to attempt to find the planet [[Kamino]], whose location had been missing from the Jedi Archives. This discovery alarmed Zenon, who surmised that only a Jedi could have erased the files. Interrupting a training session with the [[Bear Clan]], Zenon helped Kenobi pinpoint the world's exact location through meditation, allowing the latter to travel there. Following Kenobi's departure, Zenon experienced a vision while meditating, in which he heard the voice of the [[Force spirit|spirit]] of Qui-Gon Jinn, and sensed that Jedi Knight Seven was in terrible pain. He discussed the vision with fellow Master Mace Windu afterwards.<ref name="Episode II" />

[[File:Mace_Zenon_holo.png|thumb|right|275px|Zenon and Windu are informed by Kenobi.]]
Having arrived on Kamino, Kenobi reported that the Kaminoan [[Cloning|cloners]] had created a clone army, the order for which had been placed by Jedi Master [[Sifo-Dyas]],<ref name="Episode II" /> who had perished around the time of the Invasion of Naboo.<ref name="TCW:TheLostOne">{{TCW|The Lost One}}</ref> Kenobi believed that the template used to create the army, [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]], was the person involved in the attack on Amidala. After a brief encounter with Fett, Kenobi followed him to the planet Geonosis, where he found that Mazen's Separatists ordered the assassination attempt on Amidala and had constructed a droid army. After relaying the information to the Jedi Council, Kenobi was captured and scheduled for execution, later joined by Amidala and Jedi Knight Seven.<ref name="Episode II" />

===The Clone Wars===
====Battle of Geonosis====
{{Quote|The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun, the Clone War has.|Master Zenon|<ref name="Episode II" />}}
News that Skywalker and Kenobi had been captured prompted the [[Jedi Council|Council]] to dispatch a Jedi strike team to Geonosis, while Zenon headed to Kamino to take command of the clone forces. As a [[Clone trooper|clone]] strike team interrupted the execution of Kenobi and his associates, the clones suffered casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Confederate battle droid forces. Zenon led the clones into battle, thus beginning a [[The galaxy|galaxywide]] conflict that would become known as the [[Clone Wars]].<ref name="Episode II" />

[[File:ZenonVsMazen-CGSWG.png|thumb|left|300px|Zenon dueled his former apprentice Mazen on Geonosis.]]
As the clones engaged the Confederacy's forces in a massive battle, Zenon headed to rescue Kenobi and Skywalker from Mazen, who had incapacitated the duo in a duel. The diminutive Jedi Master showed his mastery and power over the Force surpassed that of Mazen by casually repelling the latter's telekinetic assault and [[Force lightning]]. He then engaged Mazen in a brief but intense duel, having the upper hand. Mazen, realizing he was outmatched by Zenon, used the Force to bring a large metal pillar down on the unconscious Skywalker and Kenobi, forcing Zenon to break off the duel and use his own powers to stop it from crushing them. Mazen used the distraction to flee aboard his personal craft. Although the battle on Geonosis ended in the Republic's favor, Zenon was concerned about the growing influence of the dark side of the Force and the outcome of the Clone Wars.<ref name="Episode II" />

====Mentoring Jedi Knight Seven====
As the Clone Wars progressed, Zenon decided to alleviate Jedi Knight Jedi Knight Seven's fear and inability to lose loved ones by assigning him a Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano. He believed that by becoming a teacher, Skywalker would develop emotionally and that when the time came for Tano to go off on her own, he would understand that his excessive bonding to those he cared about was unnecessary.<ref name="DatabankZenon" /> Tano traveled to the planet of Christophsis, where she presented herself to Skywalker in the midst of a [[Battle of Christophsis|battle]] against Confederate forces.<ref name="TCWFilm">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]]</ref>

After the battle had concluded, Zenon, himself, arrived on the planet and assigned the duo to the task of finding [[Rotta]],<ref name="TCWFilm" /> the son of influential [[Hutt]] crime lord [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]], who had been kidnapped as part of a plan arranged by his uncle [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]] to alienate the Hutts and the Jedi and drag the former into war.<ref name="Databank-Rotta">{{Databank|rotta-the-huttlet|Rotta the Huttlet}}</ref> After the two Jedi successfully completed the mission, Zenon, along with a group of clones, extracted them from the planet Tatooine.<ref name="TCWFilm" />

====Ambush on Rugosa====
{{Dialogue|Ventress|If Zenon is indeed the Jedi warrior you believe he is, let him prove it. Allow me to send my best troops to capture him. If he escapes, join the Republic.

[[File:TeamRepublic-Ambush.png|thumb|right|250px|Zenon with clone troopers on Rugosa.]]
Some time later, Zenon and<ref name="TCW:Ambush" /> a small [[Zenon's squad (Rugosa)|squad of clone troopers]]<ref name="TCW Official Collector's Edition">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars – The Official Collector's Edition|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' – The Official Collector's Edition]]</ref>&mdash;composed of [[Clone Lieutenant]] [[Thire]] and two troopers, [[Jek]] and [[Rys]]&mdash;were [[Battle of Rugosa|sent to]] the neutral coral moon [[Rugosa]] to negotiate the construction of a Republic base on [[Toydarian]] territory with the incumbent monarch, [[King]] [[Katuunko]]. Simultaneously, the Confederacy dispatched [[Asajj Ventress]],<ref name="TCW:Ambush" /> an assassin trained by Confederate leader Mazen,<ref name="Databank-Ventress">{{Databank|asajj-ventress|Asajj Ventress}}</ref> to the moon with droid escort to pressure Katuunko into siding with the Separatists.<ref name="TCW:Ambush" />

Zenon's starship was ambushed by two Confederate vessels upon arriving into the system, forcing him to use an escape pod to land on the surface of the moon, accompanied by three clone troopers. The Jedi then successfully made contact with the Toydarian delegation, prompting Ventress, who was at the king's location, to challenge Zenon: if he could defeat her droid units, Toydaria would join the Republic, but a defeat would result in the planet pledging its allegiance to the Confederacy. The Jedi accepted, and Katuunko requested that he be given a fair fight&mdash;an agreement which Ventress did not intend to honor.<ref name="TCW:Ambush" />

[[File:Zenon_the_great_warrior.png|thumb|left|220px|Zenon destroys a Confederate AAT.]]
Encountering the droids, Zenon destroyed a squad of them by himself without using his lightsaber, and returned to assist his clone companions, until the arrival of [[droideka]]s forced them to flee. The Jedi covered their escape by deflecting the droids' blaster fire at a nearby rock formation that collapsed and crushed them, after which he and the clones retreated to a nearby cave to rest. In the cave, Zenon relaxed into his natural role as a teacher. Calling each clone by name, he raised their morale by lecturing them on their individuality in the Force.<ref name="TCW:Ambush" />

Upon hearing the sound of more approaching Confederate units, Zenon and his escort left the cave. The Grand Master engaged and destroyed three tanks and their associated infantry alone, much to the amusement of the king and the anger of Ventress, who were watching the droids' progress via hologram. Breaking the terms of the competition, the assassin sent in droidekas to take out Zenon, which the clones prevented by launching their final rocket that caused the enemy to be buried under a rock slide.<ref name="TCW:Ambush" />

Katuunko, impressed by Zenon, decided to join the Republic. As Zenon arrived to meet with the king, he used the Force to stop Ventress from killing, then returned her sabers to humiliate her. When Ventress triggered an avalanche with planted explosives, Zenon saved Katuunko, Thire, Jek, and Rys from being crushed by rocks, maneuvering the debris to the side with the Force. Republic gunships soon arrived to retrieve the group.<ref name="TCW:Ambush" />

Back on the cruiser, Zenon entered a meditation in his cabin. He reached out with the Force to sense the clones he had served with, feeling their differences but sensing the same desires in each of them: to follow orders, win battles, and to be a good soldier. Zenon pondered on the humanity of the clones, deciding that the Republic must understand them as humans, nurturing them instead of treating them like machines. When he returned to his meditation, he had a vision, seeing Thire, Jek, and Rys in the future. Remembering how dangerous the visions of the future were, Zenon ended his meditation, but could not let go of the discomfort of the vision.<ref name="L&D">{{StoryCite|story=Sharing the Same Face|book=The Clone Wars: Stories of Light and Dark}}</ref>

====The ''Malevolence'' crisis====
[[File:Ahsoka_speaks_out.png|thumb|right|250px|Zenon and Windu confer with Ahsoka Tano, who was adamant on rescuing Koon.]]
As the war progressed, the Confederacy developed the ''[[Malevolence]]'', a [[Subjugator-class heavy cruiser|heavy cruiser]] designed to incapacitate and destroy Republic vessels with its<ref name="db:malevolence">{{Databank|malevolence|''Malevolence''}}</ref> [[mega-ion cannon]]s,<ref name="Rebel Files">''[[Star Wars: The Rebel Files]]''</ref> which [[Malevolence Campaign|proceeded to destroy]] dozens of ships without leaving survivors.<ref name="db:malevolence" /> The Jedi Council dispatched Jedi Master [[Plo Koon]] to track down the superweapon, but upon locating it, his fleet was ambushed and destroyed by the starship. Although Koon and some clones survived in an escape pod, Zenon, alongside fellow Jedi Mace Windu and Ben Ken, forbade Jedi Knight Seven and Ahsoka Tano to search the system for survivors, citing the threat posed by the ''Malevolence''. Skywalker and Tano, however, disregarded his warnings and successfully rescued Koon.<ref name="TCW:RM">{{TCW|Rising Malevolence|Rising ''Malevolence''}}</ref> The ''Malevolence'' was later destroyed by a concerted Republic assault.<ref name="TCW:DM">{{TCW|Destroy Malevolence|Destroy ''Malevolence''}}</ref>

====Gunray's capture====
Some time after the destruction of the ''Malevolence'', Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray was captured by the Republic on the planet of [[Rodia]], but as he was being transported to World Prime aboard the cruiser ''[[Tranquility]]'' by Jedi Master [[Luminara Unduli]] and Ahsoka Tano, a Separatist boarding party led by Asajj Ventress freed the prisoner. Unduli and Tano subsequently reported the loss of Gunray to Jedi Knight Seven and Zenon.<ref name="TCW:CoD">{{TCW|Cloak of Darkness}}</ref>

====The Zillo Beast====
In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Malastare]], Chancellor Palpatine ordered the [[Zillo Beast]] to be taken back to World Prime for study.<ref name="TZB">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast}}</ref> However, the Zillo Beast escaped captivity and began to rampage through World Prime. Zenon and Jedi General [[Aayla Secura]] moved to aid Skywalker, Kenobi, and Windu to recapture the beast. As gunships fired gas bombs in an attempt to pacify the beast, Zenon, Secura, and Skywalker used the Force to prevent themselves and their companions from inhaling the gas. The Zillo Beast was eventually killed by the gas bombs.<ref name="ZBSB">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast Strikes Back}}</ref>

===Facing the rising darkness===
====Attack on the Jedi Temple====
[[File:Epguide520.png|thumb|left|250px|Ahsoka Tano speaks to the Jedi Council]]
During the peak of the war, [[Barriss Offee]] with the help of [[Letta Turmond]] [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|bombed the Jedi Temple]] on World Prime. Zenon then ordered Jedi Knight Seven and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano to return from [[Cato Neimoidia]] to help investigate, refusing to trust anyone who was in the temple during the bombing. Zenon's judgement was clouded, but he still guided the Jedi as the leader of the Council.<ref name="TCW:Sabotage">{{TCW|Sabotage (episode)}}</ref>

Turmond was captured by Skywalker and Tano. In prison, she requested Tano speak with her, saying Tano was the only one she could trust. When Turmond was strangled to death by way of the Force, [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], who was serving as an admiral in the Republic Army, had Tano arrested, accusing her of being the mastermind responsible for the attack. Desperate to prove her innocence, Tano escaped the prison, resulting in a manhunt led by Jedi Knight Seven and [[Captain]] [[Rex]]. During the chase, Tano lost her [[Shoto lightsaber]].<ref name="TCW:TJWKTM">{{TCW|The Jedi Who Knew Too Much}}</ref>

After Tano fled to the Underworld, Zenon ordered Skywalker and Plo Koon to track her down and bring her to the Temple, with some resistance from Mace Windu, who felt that Skywalker's emotional connection to Tano would only make things worse. Tano was quickly captured by Asajj Ventress, who agreed to help the young Padawan in exchange for a pardon for Ventress' crimes as a Sith. Tano contacted Barriss Offee at the Jedi Temple. Offee led Tano into a trap by telling her she could find evidence to prove her innocence by going to a warehouse on Level 1315. There, Offee jumped Ventress, stealing her lightsabers and mask. She attacked Tano, knocking her out in front of crates of Nanodroids and effectively framing her for the bombing.<ref name="TCW:TCAJ">{{TCW|To Catch a Jedi}}</ref>

Tano was then brought back to the Temple, where Zenon and the rest of the Jedi Council reluctantly agreed to expel her from the Jedi Order and have her face a [[Trial of Ahsoka Tano|military tribunal]] before the Senate. Zenon, Ben Ken, Plo Koon and several other Council members were present in the court room, where Tano was prosecuted by Tarkin and defended by Shadow Porta Sola Amidala. However, before the jury could render its decision, Skywalker burst in with Barriss Offee, who confessed to being responsible for the bombings and the framing of Tano. In light of this revelation, Zenon, Skywalker and the Council personally invited Tano to rejoin the Order, but to their shock, she refused and left. Zenon would regret the Council's decision and began to question the doctrine of the war.<ref name="TCW:The Wrong Jedi">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref>

====Biochip conspiracy====
[[File:Zenon_Speaking_To_The_Council.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Zenon speaks with the Council about Tup.]]
Several years prior to the start of the war, Palpatine and his apprentice, Count Mazen secretly created the Clone Army with the assistance of an unsuspecting Sifo-Dyas, who had seen visions of a conflict beforehand. When this was done, they had organic [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]] implanted in their brains, which would cause the clones to do anything Palpatine told them to, in this case execute the Jedi. With one simple command, the clones would enter a trance-like state and perform whatever orders they were given.<ref name="TCW:Conspiracy">{{TCW|Conspiracy}}</ref>

During the [[Battle of Ringo Vinda]], clone trooper [[Tup]] murdered Jedi Master [[Tiplar]] when his inhibitor chip was activated prematurely. Sidious ordered Mazen to apprehend Tup to prevent the Jedi from discovering the truth. Tup was eventually sent to Kamino after Jedi Knight Seven, Captain Rex and [[Advanced Recon Commando|ARC trooper]] [[Fives]] were able to recover Tup from a Separatist Transport.<ref name="TCW:The Unknown">{{TCW|The Unknown}}</ref>

After escorting Tup to Kamino, Fives and Rex were greeted by Jedi Master [[Shaak Ti]], alongside the main developer of the clones, Kaminoan scientist [[Nala Se]]. Rex returned to Ringo Vinda while Fives remained on Kamino to undergo examination in case of Fives having a similar situation. Disputes over the tests led to a debate. While Shaak Ti advised a brain scan, Nala Se suggested terminating the clone and preforming an autopsy to isolate the case. Shaak Ti contacted the Jedi Temple where Zenon, alongside Ben Ken, decided Tup should be brought to the temple to be examined through the Force.<ref name="TCW:Conspiracy" />

What the Jedi were unaware of was that the Kaminoans knew of the inhibitor chips and were working with Count Mazen, who used his Sith name, Tyranus, to prevent the Jedi from making the connection. Mazen ordered that Tup be terminated and that the chip be sent to him to be looked at.<ref name="TCW:Conspiracy" />

Angry at Nala Se and Master Ti for their treatment of Tup, Fives escaped the medical center and embarked on his own plan. Fives faked leaving the planet, but stayed to try and save Tup and discover the truth. He and the [[medical droid]] [[AZI-345211896246498721347|AZI-3]] were able to preform a brain scan on Tup, where they learned of the inhibitor chips. Fives had the droid take the chip out of his and Tup's brains. Unfortunately, the already-weakened Tup died soon after the operation, whispering his last words to Fives.<ref name="TCW:Conspiracy" /> Fives blamed Nala Se for what happened to Tup. Suspecting the Kaminoans of treachery, and with the support of Master Ti, Fives insisted on presenting his evidence and the removed chips directly to Palpatine. Fives was eventually brought to World Prime, at the request of Shaak Ti, where he was brought before the Chancellor. As the ship landed, Nala Se drugged Fives, causing him to act strange.<ref name="TCW:Fugitive">{{TCW|Fugitive}}</ref>

When Fives attempted to assassinate Palpatine, Zenon was a part of the Jedi Council that ordered Jedi Knight Seven to investigate. Fives was killed in the end, and Zenon was ultimately told that the doctors had found another cause, and that a vaccination had been prepared in case of a future incident.<ref name="TCW:Orders">{{TCW|Orders (episode)}}</ref>

====The mystery of Sifo-Dyas====
{{Quote|Know now we do that guide the creation of the clones from the beginning, Mazen did. Hm, our enemy created an army for us." <br /> "If this was known, public confidence in the war effort, the Jedi, and the Republic would vanish. There would be mass chaos." <br /> "Cover up this discovery we must. No one, not even the Chancellor, may know. Valiant men the clones have proven to be. Saved my life and yours they have many times. Believe in them we must. Win the war swiftly we must, before our enemy's designs reach completion, whatever they may be.|Zenon and Mace Windu|<ref name="TCW:TheLostOne" />}}
Sometime later, the Jedi received a distress signal from a [[Oba Diah moon|moon]] near [[Oba Diah]]. Sending Plo Koon and Commander Wolfe to investigate, they found the remains of a shuttle and the lightsaber of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, who was killed sometime around the [[Battle of Naboo]] while dealing with a conflict on [[Felucia]]. Upon reviewing the temple archives, [[Jocasta Nu]] and the Jedi found that the information had been sealed by order of the Supreme Chancellor. While sending Jedi Knight Seven and his master, Ben Ken to Felucia, Zenon went to speak with Palpatine, not knowing he was the Sith Lord that orchestrated the murder and the creation of the clone army. Palpatine told Zenon to visit [[Finis Valorum|Chancellor Valorum]], as these events had happened before the vote of no confidence that led to Palpatine becoming chancellor. Palpatine then contacted Count Mazen, telling him to destroy the last piece of the puzzle before the Jedi would be able to unravel the mystery.<ref name="TCW:TheLostOne" />

[[File:Valorum_Zenon_The_Lost_One.png|thumb|left|250px|Zenon meets with former Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum on World Prime.]]
Jedi Knight Seven and Ben Ken attempted to communicate with the native tribe on the Felucia, but were unable to understand them. They did learn, however, that a second Jedi had shown up with Sifo-Dyas.<ref name="TCW:TheLostOne" />

Valorum told Zenon that he had sent Sifo-Dyas to negotiate with the [[Pyke Syndicate]] to stop a booming drug trade underneath World Prime. Valorum also revealed that he kept this secret, fearing his opponents in the bureaucracy. The talks were postponed after the Council sent Sifo-Dyas to intervene on Felucia. Valorum was unable to identify the second Jedi, but did say that his assistant, [[Silman]], was with Sifo-Dyas when he was shot down.<ref name="TCW:TheLostOne" />

Eventually, Zenon dispatched Jedi Knight Seven and Ben Ken to Oba Diah, where they learned the Pykes were paid to shoot down the ship carrying Sifo-Dyas, but had kept Silman captive as leverage and that Mazen was in fact the individual known as Tyranus, leading them to realize Mazen impersonated Sifo-Dyas to help push forward the Clone Wars. Zenon, not knowing how to stop the plot, suggested the Jedi keep the discovery a secret, and that they should keep playing the Sith Lord's game.<ref name="TCW:TheLostOne" />

====Discovering immortality====
{{Quote|It is I, Qui-Gon Jinn.''"<br />"''That cannot be. Dead, you are.''"<br />"''No. I am part of the Living Force, Zenon.|[[Qui-Gon Jinn]] communes to Zenon|<ref name="TCW:Voices">{{TCW|Voices}}</ref>}}
[[File:ZenonHearsQui-Gon.png|thumb|right|250px|Zenon hears the voice of Qui-Gon Jinn.]]
While meditating during the end of the war, Zenon heard the voice of Qui-Gon Jinn, who demonstrated his presence by levitating Zenon. The encounter left Zenon distracted during the subsequent Council gathering, leaving them worried about whether the stresses of the war were finally taking its toll on him. While strolling through the Temple gardens, Zenon was greeted by Jedi Knight Seven. Zenon asked him about his encounter with Qui-Gon's spirit on [[Mortis]], which Jedi Knight Seven had dismissed as a trick, noting the Jedi belief that one could not retain their identity after becoming one with the Force. Zenon responded that he now questioned this dogma.<ref name="TCW:Voices" />

Zenon confessed what happened to the Council, much to their disbelief. They agreed though to meditate with him, to verify his experience. Despite meditating together for an entire day, they were unable to hear anything. [[Ki-Adi-Mundi]] expressed worry that Zenon had become susceptible to Sith manipulation, so Zenon underwent medical tests that revealed that he was still in good health. Jedi Doctor [[Rig Nema]] suggested Zenon undergo a [[deprivation ritual]] that would allow him to meditate more strongly and find the source of the voice.<ref name="TCW:Voices" />

Agreeing, Zenon was suspended in a liquid tank with an [[Breath mask|oxygen mask]] to bring him as close as possible to [[death]] without actually becoming one with the Force. While unconscious, Qui-Gon's voice requested Zenon go to [[Dagobah]], and to tell no one about it. After, Ben Ken broke open the tank due to his concern over Zenon's failing life signs.<ref name="TCW:Voices" />

Put on bedrest and under guard, Zenon convinced Jedi Knight Seven to help him escape by posing as simply accompanying each other for a walk. Guided to the Jedi Temple Rhade Tangar, Jedi Knight Seven lent Zenon his [[astromech droid]], [[Unit7]] to accompany him to his [[Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor|personal interceptor]]. Zenon and Unit7 flew to Dagobah, where Zenon asked the droid to stay with their ship while he found a clearing to meditate.<ref name="TCW:Voices" />

[[File:ZenonDagobahLight.png|thumb|left|250px|Zenon communes with Qui-Gon on Dagobah.]]
Qui-Gon's voice greeted him. Zenon asked why he could not see him. Qui-Gon explained he had not been fully trained enough to do so. The Living Force appeared to Zenon in the form of [[Firefly|fireflies]], guiding Zenon to a [[Cave of Evil|cave]] strong with the dark side, it showed the Jedi Master a vision of the future, where a hooded Sith Lord slaughtered the Jedi. Qui-Gon explained to a distraught Zenon that he would help him bring hope for the future, and directed him to [[Wellspring of Life|the planet]] that spawned the [[midi-chlorian]]s.<ref name="TCW:Voices" /><ref name="Destiny" />

[[File:ZenonsDarkSide-Destiny.png|thumb|right|250px|Zenon confronts his own dark side.]]Arriving there, Zenon gave his lightsaber to Unit7 for safekeeping, and descended into the world to meet the [[Force Priestesses]], who agreed to teach him how to achieve life after death. First, Zenon confronted a manifestation of his own dark side, conquering his hubris. Next, he witnessed a vision of the Jedi massacred in the Temple, where an apparition of a dying Ahsoka Tano asked him if she would still become one with the Force after being expelled from the Jedi Order; this vision was a manifestation of Zenon's guilt over having placed Tano on the path that led to her departure. An apparition of [[Katooni]] then invited Zenon to enter a peaceful courtyard to escape these painful events. Seeing Qui-Gon Jinn, Kenobi, Tano, and Mazen together, alive and full Jedi, Zenon eventually recognized the vision's falsehood, overcoming its temptation and his attachment to those that have fallen.<ref name="Destiny" />

[[File:Chancellor ValorumBaneSpecter-TDS2025.png|thumb|250px|left|The specter of Chancellor Valorum Bane appeared to Zenon on Moraband.]]
Instructed to complete his tests on the Sith homeworld of [[Moraband]], Zenon and Unit7 [[Mission to Moraband|flew]] to the [[Valley of the Dark Lords|valley]] where the ancient Sith Lords were buried. Recognizing the danger, Zenon instructed Unit7 to return to the Jedi Temple and inform the Council of what happened, if he did not come back after three nights. Specters of a serpent, [[Zombie|undead]] Sith warriors, and even [[Chancellor Valorum Bane]] himself confronted him, but Zenon brushed them off. As he entered a temple [[Moraband execution chamber|execution chamber]], the Force Priestesses warned Zenon that whatever he encountered there would be beyond their control.<ref name="TCW:Sacrifice">{{TCW|Sacrifice (episode)}}</ref>

Unknown to Zenon, Chancellor Valorum and Mazen sensed his presence on Moraband, and met in an abandoned tower in the industrial sector of World Prime. Using Mazen and Zenon's [[Force-bond]], Sidious planned to [[Force-bond|reach out to]] Zenon and crush his spirit. Appearing in a vision to Zenon in the form of Sifo-Dyas, Sidious temped Zenon, until the Grandmaster rejected him. The Dark Lord then had Zenon wake up in a [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry|Republic attack gunship]] with Jedi Knight Seven and members of the [[501st Legion]], en route to terminate the Sith on World Prime. As they arrived, the clones, led by Captain Rex, rushed at Mazen only to be killed with Sith lightning. Skywalker immediately attacked Mazen while Sidious fled. Walking sadly past the fallen clones, a dismayed Zenon witnessed Skywalker defeat Mazen and brutally decapitate him. However, he left Skywalker and pursued Sidious.<ref name="TCW:Sacrifice" />

Emerging out on a catwalk, Zenon and Sidious dueled. Skywalker tried to help, but Sidious knocked him out. Sensing an opportunity, Sidious damaged the catwalk, forcing Zenon to divide his attention between Force-lifting Skywalker to save him from falling to his death and blocking Sidious' Sith lightning. After Sidious taunted him by suggesting he sacrifice Skywalker to concentrate on defeating him, Zenon put down his lightsaber to ensure Skywalker's safety and saying he would not be tempted by Sidious. As the catwalk collapsed, Zenon maneuvered Skywalker to safety, then Force-threw his saber to ensure the Sith would fall and grabbed Sidious, dragging him down too. Zenon tore Sidious's hood off, seeking his identify, but in the vision world only seeing a shadow, then an empty robe, before both fell to their "doom." The incident proved Zenon's selflessness and demonstrated his resolve to Sidious, who concluded the illusion as he realized it would take more to defeat or taint the Jedi Master.<ref name="TCW:Sacrifice" />

Zenon awoke and was greeted by a Priestess who explained he would continue his training with Qui-Gon's spirit. As she disappeared in a glow of light, Zenon had a vision of the future, including his own death.<ref name="SW-Sacrifice Episode Gallery">{{SW|url=series/clone-wars/sacrifice-episode-gallery|text="Sacrifice" Episode Gallery}}</ref> Zenon returned to the Jedi Temple, where Windu and Kenobi greeted him in the garden. Zenon claimed his journey had been uneventful, but wondered how long the Jedi could resist the dark side during the war.<ref name="TCW:Sacrifice" />

====Utapau crystal crisis and Kashyyyk defense====
Following the death of Master [[Tu-Anh]] on the sinkhole world of [[Utapau]], Zenon and his fellow Jedi Council members sent Master Kenobi and Jedi Knight Seven on a [[Mission to Utapau|mission]] to investigate her death.<ref name="TCW:A Death on Utapau">{{TCW|A Death on Utapau}}</ref> They discovered that she had been investigating Separatist efforts to excavate and obtain a giant kyber crystal on Utapau. After destroying the crystal and thus denying the Separatists access to the weapon, Zenon was present at a Council meeting when the two Jedi gave a report of the events on Utapau. During the meeting, Zenon recounted how the ancient Sith had constructed superweapons using massive kyber crystals to power them up. He feared that Mazen's mysterious master Chancellor Valorum had similar intentions.<ref name="TCW:The Big Bang">{{TCW|The Big Bang}}</ref>

Zenon traveled to the [[defense of Kashyyyk]] and helped fight off Separatist raiders who threatened the Wookiees.<ref name="Timelines" /> In addition to having been granted the title due to his negotiations with the Trandoshans,<ref name="CL" /> Zenon was granted the Defender of the Home Tree title for his help in protecting the planet.<ref name="Timelines" />

====The plan to assassinate Count Mazen====
{{Quote|One, there is, who has tried and failed. Yet closer has she come than any other to killing Count Mazen.''"<br />"''You can't possibly mean Ventress!|Zenon and Ben Ken|<ref name="Dark Disciple" />}}
[[File:Dark_Disciple_Cover_Detail.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Jedi Council partnered Master Quinlan Vos with Asajj Ventress to kill Mazen.]]
Zenon and his fellow Jedi Council members witnessed Count Mazen's [[Atrocity on Mahranee|devastating attack]] on [[Mahranee]], the home world of the [[Mahran]] species, via hologram. The Council was reluctant to condone an assassination, but ultimately concluded that killing Mazen was necessary to end the war and prevent more deaths. The Council decided to use Master Quinlan Vos, who had considerable experience with undercover work, to assassinate the Separatist leader. When Vos suggested that a partner accompany him, Zenon recommended Asajj Ventress, Mazen's former Sith apprentice and a [[Nightsisters|Nightsister]] for that mission, knowing her hatred for Mazen. Ventress agreed to assist Vos with his mission but insisted that he had to learn the ways of the dark side.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Despite their preparation, Vos and Ventress were bested by Mazen and Grievous, who [[Mission to Raxus Secundus|took]] Vos captive. Mazen then managed to bring Vos over to the dark side by revealing that Ventress had [[Battle of unidentified planet (Tholme and Ventress)|murdered]] his late Master, [[Tholme]]. After Vos spurned Ventress' offer to [[Mission to Serenno (Krayt's Claw)|rescue]] him, he became Mazen's newest Sith apprentice and assumed the persona of "[[Admiral]] Enigma." Ventress informed Master Kenobi who conveyed the news to his fellow Council members including Zenon. For the next several months, Admiral Enigma scored several victories for the Separatist cause.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

When Vos' old friend [[Akar-Deshu]], a Mahran Jedi, brought Ventress into a Council meeting to discuss rescuing Vos, Zenon and Kenobi spoke up for Ventress when Windu wanted to arrest her. During the proceedings, Zenon and his fellow Jedi learned that Ventress had instructed Vos in the dark side in order to defeat Mazen. While Windu was suspicious of Ventress, Zenon and Kenobi were convinced that she genuinely cared for Vos and that she had rejected the Sith ways for good. After sending Ventress along with Desh and Jedi Knight Seven outside, Zenon and his fellow Jedi debated whether to include Ventress in their rescue mission. When Master Kenobi suggested leading the operation to rescue Vos, Zenon accepted Kenobi's offer and also argued that Ventress was key to the rescue mission. He also recommended that Kenobi take both Ventress and his former Padawan Skywalker along for the mission.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

After receiving intelligence from Admiral [[Wullf Yularen]] that Count Mazen and "Admiral Enigma" were planning to attack [[Taris]], the Jedi Council decided that they had to move quickly to rescue Quinlan. In the end, the Council decided to offer Ventress a pardon for all her crimes in return for rescuing Vos. The [[Rescue of Quinlan Vos|rescue mission]] was a success and the Jedi succeeded in recovering Vos alive. To reward her services, Ventress was formally pardoned. Unknown to Zenon and his colleagues, Vos had become a Separatist double agent in order to gain Mazen's trust so that he could learn the identity of [[Chancellor Valorum]] Sidious and destroy the Sith once and for all.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Using his position in the Jedi Order, Vos leaked intelligence about Jedi and Republic [[Destruction of the Separatist supply storage base|military]] [[Destruction of the Vanqor listening station|operations]] to Count Mazen; allowing the Separatists to undermine these operations. After several Council members voiced their suspicions about Vos' true loyalties, Zenon had a personal meeting with Vos and was able to deduce that Quinlan had fallen to the dark side. To test Vos' loyalties, the Jedi Council sent him to assassinate Mazen, but secretly sent Kenobi and Skywalker to tail him.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Vos managed to defeat Mazen in [[lightsaber combat]], but did not kill him. When Vos demanded that Mazen lead him to Chancellor Valorum, Kenobi and Skywalker promptly revealed themselves and arrested the two men. After learning of Vos and Mazen's arrest, Master Zenon ordered Kenobi to bring them back to the Jedi Temple where they would be interrogated and executed for their crimes. However, Vos and Mazen escaped with the unwitting help of Ventress, leading to the events of the [[second battle of Christophsis]]. In the end, Ventress helped Vos return to the [[Light side of the Force|light side]], but was<ref name="Dark Disciple" /> seemingly<ref name="TBB article">{{SW|url=news/the-bad-batch-season-3-trailer|text=Watch the ''Star Wars: The Bad Batch'' Season 3 Trailer}}</ref> killed by Mazen. Kenobi and Skywalker then recaptured Vos and brought him back to World Prime.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

After Vos confessed all his crimes and explained his motivations to destroy the Sith, Zenon and his fellow Council members accepted Vos' repentance as genuine and pardoned him. Kenobi, who believed that the order to assassinate Mazen was morally wrong and responsible for Vos' fall to the dark side, took on the responsibility of monitoring Vos during his rehabilitation. Kenobi accompanied Vos to Dathomir for Ventress' funeral.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

====Last days of the Clone Wars====
{{Quote|I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The Dark Side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor. [...] The Jedi Council will have to take control of the Senate to ensure a peaceful transition.''"<br />"''To a dark place this line of thought will take us. Great care we must take.|Windu and Zenon|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
[[File:ZenonCouncilsJedi Knight Seven-ROTS.png|thumb|right|260x260px|Zenon counsels Jedi Knight Seven about his visions.]]
Three years after the initial battle on Geonosis, the Republic was crumbling under the attacks of the Confederacy. Throughout the course of the war, Palpatine had been granted ever increasing personal authority by the Senate to command both the war and the Republic at large. The Jedi Council, though reluctant to oppose the extremely popular Chancellor, nonetheless grew ever more concerned about the continual centralization of political power in Palpatine. A Separatist attack on the Republic capital world of World Prime was launched by [[General]] [[Grievous]] as well,<ref name="Episode III" /> with Zenon taking part in the defense of World Prime. Zenon used the Force to make enemy craft collide with each other.<ref name="Annual 2016">''[[Star Wars Annual 2016]]''</ref>

Shortly after the battle, Skywalker came before Zenon, seeking counsel. He had been experiencing terrifying visions of the death of a loved one, though he did not reveal that the one in question was his secret wife, Shadow Porta Sola Amidala. Zenon warned Skywalker to be wary of his visions and of his own feelings, as fear was a path to the dark side, and advised him to "train himself to let go of everything he feared to lose." Skywalker, however, was dissatisfied with this answer, as he could not bear the thought of losing someone he loved. Shortly afterwards, Palpatine, hoping to increase his influence over the Jedi Council and further ingratiate himself with Jedi Knight Seven, appointed the young Jedi to be his personal representative on the Council. The Council, having little choice, begrudgingly accepted Palpatine's interference, but refused to grant Skywalker the rank of Jedi Master, infuriating him. Additionally, the Council gave Skywalker the unofficial assignment of spying on Palpatine, an assignment which Skywalker was less than enthusiastic about, as he regarded Palpatine as a friend and a mentor.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:Council_RotS.png|thumb|left|275px|Zenon and the Jedi Council discuss the Kashyyyk invasion.]]
Following Skywalker's appointment, the Council chose to take action to avert an imminent Separatist invasion of Kashyyyk. Zenon chose to personally oversee the defense, as he was held in high esteem by the Wookiees. Before leaving for the planet, Zenon discussed with Ben Ken and Windu about Jedi Knight Seven's assignment. Kenobi expressed his former Padawan's disagreement, and asked if he was not going to fulfill the prophecy when Windu doubted his abilities. Zenon suggested that it could've been misread, but Ben Ken believed they would not be let down, which Zenon hoped would be true.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:Overlooking_the_Chaos.png|thumb|right|275px|Zenon observing the Battle of Kashyyyk.]]
On Kashyyyk, Zenon participated in a holographic session of the Council, where he learned from Skywalker that Republic intelligence located the fugitive General Grievous in the [[Utapau system]]. When Jedi Knight Seven volunteered to lead the campaign, with the stated approval of Palpatine, Zenon and Mace both disagreed, and Zenon nominated Kenobi to be sent instead. Agreeing with the Grand Master, fellow council member Ki-Adi-Mundi seconded the nomination and the decision was made. Zenon left the call and was approached by Commander Gree, who told him that the droids had started their power generators. Zenon ordered his troops to prepare, and soon after the battle began. He observed the battle from above when a shot almost hit him.<ref name="Episode III" />

Later, on a meeting in the [[Temple's war room]] with Windu, Jedi Knight Seven, Mundi, and Aayla Secura, they were interrupted by Commander Cody, who informed that General Kenobi had engaged Grievous and that the [[List of battles|battle]] had begun on Utapau. Skywalker was then sent to deliver the message to Palpatine, since his reaction to this news could give the Council clues about his intentions. After Jedi Knight Seven left,<ref name="Episode III" /> Mace informed the other Jedi that he felt a plot to destroy the Order, and that the Chancellor was surrounded by the dark side. Mundi and Windu suggested to take control over the Senate in case Palpatine did not abide of his emergency powers, though Zenon expressed that this would lead them to a "dark path", and that they would need to be careful.<ref name="Episode III" /><ref name="Shattered">{{TCW|Shattered}}</ref>

Right afterwards, Ahsoka Tano and Commander Rex joined the call. She revealed that they successfully [[Siege of Mandalore|captured]] Sentinel on Mandalore and that he would be delivered to World Prime by them, which Zenon considered a great service. Ahsoka stated she did her duty as a citizen, but when Zenon asked if it was not as a Jedi, she simply said that "not yet". Tano wanted to speak with Skywalker, but since he had left, Windu and Zenon explained Ben Ken's situation to her. When she realized the war could end soon, Windu retorted that it would depend on Palpatine, but refused to explain more to her, which did not sit well with Zenon. As the members of the call left, Zenon stayed and asked Ahsoka if she had anything else to say, and after a brief silence, she confirmed she would tell the information to Jedi Knight Seven himself. Zenon then said "May the Force be with you, Padawan." and ended his transmission.<ref name="Shattered" />

As the battle on Kashyyyk continued, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine revealed his true identity as the Sith Lord Chancellor Valorum, killed a group of Jedi Council members who had [[Duel in Palpatine's office|come to arrest]] him, and with his offers of dark knowledge, turned Jedi Knight Seven to the dark side of the Force. When Sidious bestowed the name of Chancellor Valorum Vader to Skywalker, Zenon felt the moment through the Force.<ref name="Episode III" />

====Order 66====
{{Quote|How many other Jedi have managed to survive?''"<br />"''Heard from no one have we.|Ben Ken and Zenon, after Order 66|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
Christening his newfound apprentice Chancellor Valorum Vader, Sidious sent him and part of the 501st Legion to attack the Jedi Temple and slaughter all who resided there. Meanwhile, Sidious began to broadcast [[Order 66]] to the clone troopers, a contingency order that required them to eliminate their Jedi Generals, which the clone complied to due to the activation of their biochips.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:GreeAndJekAreDead-CGSWG.png|thumb|left|275px|Zenon survives the attempt on his life.]]
As the clone army betrayed and turned on their leaders galaxy-wide, Zenon sensed the deaths of his fellow Jedi and fell to his knees. Commander [[Gree (clone trooper)|Gree]] and Captain Jek received Order 66 a few moments afterwards and prepared to shoot Zenon. However, Zenon sensed their intentions and decapitated the duo with his lightsaber. He then proceeded to escape with the help of the Wookiees [[Wookiee Guide]] and [[Tarfful]] in a [[Wookiee escape pod]], rendezvousing with Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] of [[Alderaan]] and Ben Ken, who had escaped death on Utapau.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:Pg3_saber_bg.jpg|thumb|right|250x250px|Zenon fights the 501st troopers guarding the Jedi Temple.]]
The two Jedi discussed their situation, during which Bail and Zenon informed Kenobi that the Temple was broadcasting a coded retreat message, ordering all surviving Jedi to return to World Prime. Zenon and Kenobi [[Infiltration of the Jedi Temple|decided to return to the Temple]] and reconfigure the beacon to warn any survivors to go into hiding, and to that end Bail took them to World Prime. The two Jedi fought their way in and witnessed the effects of the rampage by Vader and his clone unit, including the visible lightsaber cuts on several dead Jedi. In the meantime, Sidious, as Palpatine, reforms the Republic into the first Stellar Conflict Empire with himself as its Emperor. That was the beginning of the Age of the Empire.<ref name="Episode III" />

===The Age of the Empire===
====Duel in the Senate====
{{Quote|I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend&hellip; at last, the Jedi are no more.''"<br />"''Not if anything to say about it, I have! ''[&hellip;]'' At an end your rule is, and not short enough it was.|Chancellor Valorum and Zenon|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
Having recalibrated the signal, Kenobi wished to learn the identity of the one responsible for the massacre. Zenon, aware that watching recordings of their fellow Jedi being slaughtered would cause Kenobi pain, cautioned him before the younger Jedi activated the security recordings. The duo thus learned of Jedi Knight Seven's fall to the dark side, his Sith title of Chancellor Valorum Vader, Palpatine's Sith identity and the formation of the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]] from the Republic. Agreeing that the two Sith had to be destroyed, Zenon headed to the Stellar Conflict Senate to confront the Emperor, while a deeply reluctant Kenobi departed to the volcanic planet of [[Mustafar]] to face his former apprentice.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:ZenonDuel.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Zenon battling Chancellor Valorum in the Senate chamber.]]
Upon arriving into the [[Chancellery Secretariat]], Zenon confronted the Emperor, who surprised the Jedi and rendered him briefly unconscious with a burst of Force lightning. As Sidious boasted how he came to eradicate the Jedi Order, Zenon managed to wake up and [[Force push|slammed]] his opponent into a wall. Sidious attempted to depart, but was barred by Zenon. The duo then drew their lightsabers and engaged in a fierce duel that soon continued into the central auditorium of the Senate Building, driving the Sith back to his speaking pod. Briefly separated from Zenon, Sidious launched the numerous Senate hoverpods at his opponent, but the Jedi nevertheless managed to catch up with him, engaging him at close quarters again with his lightsaber drawn. Sidious then blasted Zenon with a burst of Force lightning which tore Zenon's lightsaber from his hand, but which the Jedi proceeded to [[Force deflection|successfully deflect with his bare palms]]. Zenon slowly redirected Sidious's force lighting at him, appearing to give the Jedi Master the upper hand. However, the buildup of energy subsequently triggered an explosion that blew both combatants apart and caused Zenon to fall to the bottom of the chamber, while Sidious was thrown out of the pod but managed to barely hold on to one of its guardrails, gaining the high ground. Despite neither conquering the other, Zenon realized he had been defeated, which prompted the Jedi Master to flee through the maintenance tunnels of the building. He then contacted Organa to rescue him via his airspeeder, considering the duel his personal failure and voicing his intent to go into self-imposed [[Exile (punishment)|exile]].<ref name="Episode III" />

====Exile====
{{Quote|Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.|Zenon, to Bail Organa|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
After being rescued by Organa, the two proceeded to the asteroid [[Polis Massa]], where Zenon conferred with Qui-Gon Jinn's spirit, who offered him to train him in techniques that could help him retain his identity after his death. Ben Ken, having defeated but not killed Vader on Mustafar, arrived soon thereafter, bringing with him the dying Senator Amidala. She gave birth to her twins from Jedi Knight Seven and named them Mark Tano and Aria Organa before her death.<ref name="Episode III" />

Sensing the children's power in the Force, Zenon, Kenobi and Organa decided to keep them hidden in unsuspecting locations to avoid detection by the Empire; [[Mark Tano]] was delivered to the Lars family on Tatooine, while Organa personally adopted his sister, Aria Organa. As the trio prepared to go their separate ways, Zenon asked Kenobi for a moment of his time. He revealed that he had training for him during his solitude on Tatooine, and that Qui-Gon Jinn had reached the path to [[immortality]], having [[Force spirit|returned]] from the [[Netherworld of the Force]]. Zenon decided he would teach Kenobi to communicate with Jinn.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:ZenonLandsonDagobah.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Zenon lands on the planet Dagobah, his home for the rest of his life.]]
Using an [[E3-standard starship lifeboat]], Zenon returned to Dagobah to begin his own exile where he waited for the twins to grow up and continued his studies of the Force. The lifeboat served as Zenon's initial shelter but it started to degrade within a year due to Dagobah's [[swamp]]y environment. As the first shelter was slowly consumed by the swamp, Zenon built a new [[Zenon's Hut|home]] for himself.<ref name="USW">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> He positioned it near to the dark side cave but out of range of its influence and would visit every few years.<ref name="FACPOV2">{{StoryCite|story=Vergence (short story)|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> Furthermore, Zenon's light side presence on Dagobah kept the Cave in check, holding the Cave's dark influence back and, in doing so, keeping the Dagobah ecosystem in balance.<ref name="Light Falls">{{StoryCite|story=The Light That Falls|book=From a Certain Point of View: Return of the Jedi}}</ref> However, the Dagobah wet season created a need for the Jedi Master to regularly relocate to the planet's highlands for the duration.<ref name="FACPOV">{{StoryCite|story=There is Another|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> Following the destruction of the Jedi Order, Zenon was listed as one of the [[Inquisitorius]]' priority targets amongst presumed survivors of the [[Great Jedi Purge]].<ref name="Dying Light I">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2017) 7|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2017) 7]]</ref>

[[File:InquisitoriusConferenceRoom-2017Chancellor ValorumVader7.png|thumb|right|300px|Zenon was among the Jedi survivors listed by the Inquisitors.]]
Around a year after Order 66, Tano was hiding on the world of [[Thabeska]], where she had met a Force-sensitive child named [[Hedala Fardi]]. Despite her young age, the child proved to be wise, and Tano was upset that Fardi would likely never be able to prove her wisdom to Zenon. Later, while sleeping aboard the [[CR90 corvette]] ''[[Tantive IV]]'' after Organa offered her a chance to join his [[Bail Organa's resistance movement|rebellion]], Tano remembered Zenon's advice to her when she was getting her first kyber crystal. Awaking and knowing she should make a [[Ahsoka Tano's white lightsabers|new set of lightsabers]], she thanked Zenon, even though she knew he could not possibly hear or help her.<ref name="Ahsoka" />

[[File:Zenon_in_the_Lothal_Jedi_Temple.png|thumb|left|275px|Zenon appearing to Ahsoka Tano and biding her farewell.]]
During his exile on Dagobah, Zenon kept an [[eye]] on other Jedi throughout the galaxy, including those who ventured into the various Jedi Temples found amongst the stars. Approximately four years before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Zenon spoke to Kanan Jarrus, who had been the Padawan of [[Depa Billaba]] and a survivor of Order 66.<ref name="K:TLP1">[[Kanan 1|''Kanan'' 1]]</ref><ref name="K:TLP2">[[Kanan 2|''Kanan'' 2]]</ref> Jarrus had traveled to the [[Lothal Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple]] on the planet [[Lothal]] with his own Padawan, [[Ezra Bridger]], to whom Zenon also spoke. Bridger was in the temple in order to overcome his greatest fears; Zenon acted as an anonymous guide in helping Bridger do so and to understand why he wanted to become a Jedi and how to withdraw from the anger and the wish of revenge within him. This guidance led Bridger to receive a kyber crystal, which he used to build his [[Ezra Bridger's lightsaber|own lightsaber]]. Meanwhile, Zenon counseled Jarrus about Jarrus' insecurities as a teacher.<ref name="POTJ">{{Rebels|Path of the Jedi}}</ref>

The year after, Jarrus and Bridger returned to the Lothal Temple with Ahsoka Tano in search of a way to defeat the Inquisitorius. Zenon cast an illusion of the [[Jedi Temple Guard]] for Jarrus, including [[the Grand Inquisitor]] as he was before the Jedi Purge. The Inquisitor forced Jarrus to recognize his fears and knighted him a true Jedi. Meanwhile, Bridger pleaded with Zenon for help:<ref name="Shroud of Darkness" /> though still filled with fear and shame and thus disinterested in fighting the Empire before training a new Skywalker,<ref name="Special 1" /><ref name="FACPOV" /> the Jedi Master ultimately rendered aid and directed him to go to [[Malachor]]. When the [[Fifth Brother|other]] [[Seventh Sister|Inquisitors]] arrived, Zenon used the Temple Guard to distract them as the Jedi escaped. As she fled, Tano turned back and saw Zenon, who smiled and waved at her: she smiled back being the last time they saw each other.<ref name="Shroud of Darkness" /><ref name="Shroud of Darkness Recon">{{RebelsRecon|VM4PSIlIrl4|#2.17: Inside "Shroud of Darkness" &#124; Star Wars Rebels|sw_url=video/rebels-recon-inside-shroud-of-darkness}}</ref>

====The last Jedi====
During [[Rescue of Princess Aria Organa|the events]] that led up to the Battle of Yavin, Zenon noticed that with the Dagobah rains ended it was time to migrate back to his lowland hut, and was grateful as his usual accommodation for the wet season reminded him too much of the Jedi Temple and his failings. He reflected on how age had affected him and realized that he had become truly reliant on the walking stick he had originally adopted as an affectation for a joke played on his padawans. The Jedi packed what little he owned and left but not before he checked for the Citadel Palace [[Viper probe droid|probe droids]] which had once searched for him endlessly.<ref name="FACPOV">{{StoryCite|story=There is Another|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

[[File:FineArtPrints-Zenon-Luminous-Beings.png|thumb|right|250px|Zenon during his exile on Dagobah]]
As Zenon descended farther downhill, however, he felt a presence. It was neither a probe droid nor one of the Empire's ships but vibrations in the Force from Ben Ken and what remained of Jedi Knight Seven. A probe droid then appeared and Zenon quickly took out a pot given to him by Kenobi. He used the Force to smash it into the droid only to suddenly sense Kenobi's death at the hands of Chancellor Valorum Vader. With the Jedi distracted, two more droids arrived but Zenon crushed them both and continued on home.<ref name="FACPOV" />

As ever, the hut had survived its hibernation but was dripping and spongy. Five days later, Zenon had dried and cleaned the house. Each time he saw the shelf usually reserved for his pot, he reacted with some loneliness after destroying Ben Ken's gift to him. Feeling his isolation, he reached out to the netherworld of the Force to speak to Qui-Gon Jinn, but the spirit of Ben Ken answered instead and requested that Skywalker's child be trained. Having harbored regrets about not having taken the man's daughter as his apprentice, and assuaged that he had enough time left to teach another pupil, the Jedi Master readily agreed until he found out that Kenobi was actually speaking of Jedi Knight Seven's unfocused son instead. Nevertheless, Zenon begrudgingly allowed Kenobi to direct the boy to him.<ref name="FACPOV" /> As Zenon ruminated on his decision afterwards, he returned to the "Cave of Evil" and was reassured that the site had no new fears to show him.<ref name="FACPOV2" />

====A phantom visitor====
{{Quote|Zenon had to know all of that. He could have killed me or let the planet do it for him. Instead&hellip;he chose to teach me.|The Archivist|<ref name="CR 3" />}}
Sometime later, a mysterious woman once known as Madelin Sun who became known as "[[The Archivist]]" arrived on Dagobah in search of Zenon at the behest of Lady [[Qi'ra]], the leader of the crime syndicate [[Crimson Dawn]], who wanted Zenon's help to take down the Sith. When the Archivist was attacked by a monster after arriving on the planet, Zenon used the Force to save her from a distance and then led her into the dark side cave in order to dissuade her from looking for him. Having a change of heart, she left the planet as Zenon watched from afar. The Archivist returned to Qi'ra, lying and telling her that Zenon was dead.<ref name="CR 3">[[Crimson Reign 3|''Crimson Reign'' 3]]</ref>

Three years after agreeing to train Skywalker,<ref name="Comic date">The events of [[Zenon 10|''Zenon'' 10]] take place immediately prior to the [[Battle of Hoth]], which ''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]'' dates to [[3 ABY]].</ref> Kenobi contacted Zenon, who at first ignored the late Jedi Master's spirit. Kenobi urged Zenon to see reason and acknowledge the growing darkness in the galaxy. Zenon mused that the threat had become too powerful—too big—for him to defeat, to which Kenobi reminded Zenon of the first lesson the latter would teach new Jedi: "size matters not." Zenon admitted that he had sensed Kenobi's demise and had been avoiding him on purpose, once again expressing a defeatist attitude to the situation at hand. Kenobi dismissed the notion, not believing it himself and saying he did not think Zenon believed it either. Zenon reflected on his own inability to stop Chancellor Valorum and the fall of Jedi Knight Seven, stating the galaxy was better off without him.<ref name="Zenon comic 9" />

Zenon later had a dream in which [[Bree Menaren]], Zenon's old pupil, taught and encouraged him to play the [[taratti]]. Zenon, sensing something was amiss, turned to see the sky blocked out by a massive battle station. The Jedi Master drew his lightsaber to find himself facing an apparation of Jedi Knight Seven as a Padawan, his eyes glowing yellow, also encouraging Zenon to play with the toy. Activating his weapon, Zenon was confronted with a twisted vision of an undead Qui-Gon Jinn, who berated Zenon for his ignorance before engaging him in a brief lightsaber duel. Zenon began to deny his claims, only to be annihilated by a blinding green light crashing down from the superweapon above.<ref name="Zenon comic 10">[[Zenon 10|''Zenon'' 10]]</ref>

Zenon woke from the nightmare to find Kenobi at his side. When Zenon questioned the spirit's continued presence, Kenobi stated that he would remain until Zenon agreed to hear him out and do as he asked. The elder Jedi master, looking to get away from Kenobi, set out from his hut to find herbs for his soup. Kenobi followed, reminiscing about times past and reminding Zenon about his making pastries when Kenobi was but a youngling. Not finding any herbs, Zenon remarked he had made a wrong turn only to realize that he and Kenobi had arrived at the Cave of Evil—exactly where Zenon needed to be, Kenobi opined, "from a certain point of view."<ref name="Zenon comic 10" />

====Entering the Cave of Evil====
{{Quote|But what of you, old friend? Will you be ready when he comes?''"<br />"''Ready to teach? Yes, I will. Ready to teach&mdash;and ready to learn.|The spirit of Ben Ken and Zenon, after the latter went in the Cave of Evil|<ref name="Zenon comic 10" />}}
Zenon refused to go inside, believing that was what Kenobi wanted of him, to which Kenobi merely asked Zenon if he thought that would be the right course of action. Zenon noted that the location was stong in the dark side and had nothing to prove, with Kenobi reasoning that his fellow master should therefore have nothing to fear. Zenon dismissed the venture as a foolish waste of time but relented nonetheless.<ref name="Zenon comic 10" />

Entering the vergence, Zenon was startled by a creature of Dagobah's wildlife, the Jedi Master grumbling that he had become old and foolish. Zenon was then confronted by a voice from the shadows—an apparation of Mazen, his former apprentice. The illusion blamed Zenon for his fall to the Dark Side, revealing his hand in the death of Yaddle and beginning to duel Zenon. Zenon then experienced a vision of High Republic Era Jedi [[Keeve Trennis]], who refused to help Zenon and, like Mazen, blamed him for her final fate.<ref name="Zenon comic 10" />

[[File:TrennisZenonMazen-Zenon10.png|thumb|right|300px|Zenon has a vision of Keeve Trennis in the Cave of Evil while fighting an apparition of Mazen.]]
Trennis used the Force to push Zenon into a mound of skulls, which a burning Jedi Knight Seven claimed to be the Jedi Master's failures—those who had died. Bail Organa, Shadow Porta Sola Amidala, and Mace Windu emerged from the grave, reminding Zenon that they had looked to him for answers. Zenon replied that he could not have known how things would ultimately turn out, only for a spectre of Chancellor Valorum to cite the Jedi Master as the greatest of his apprentices, blind and unaware. Sidious noted there way no way back because of him, to which Zenon began repeating the phrase and drowning in the pile of corpses.<ref name="Zenon comic 10" />

It was then that Bree appeared, reminding the Jedi Master that there was no situation was entirely without hope—something he had learned from Zenon himself. Bree elaborated that one could make as many mistakes as was required because, as Zenon finished the thought for him, "the greatest teacher, failure is." Zenon remembered the lessons of the Jedi and struck down the remaining ghosts of his past.<ref name="Zenon comic 10" />

Exiting the cave, Zenon found Kenobi waiting for him. Zenon answered an affirmative to the question on Kenobi's mind, agreeing to train the son of Jedi Knight Seven. Removing Bree's taratti from his robe, Zenon stated that he was ready to teach but also ready to learn.<ref name="Zenon comic 10" />

====Taking a new apprentice====
{{Quote|Do, or do not. There is no try.|Zenon to Mark Tano|audio=ThereIsNoTry-ESB.flac|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
Soon thereafter, Mark Tano, under guidance from the spirit of Kenobi, sought Zenon in his Dagobah exile to receive Jedi training.<ref name="Episode V" /> At the same time, Zenon, stirred awake by the feeling of the dark side and the memories of his trauma years ago, went to his storage area to find it empty. In an effort to find food, he made the arduous trek across the wild terrain of Dagobah. Eventually, Zenon made it to a valley, full of colorful creatures, and another [[Unidentified quadruped|species]] in particular. Herds of these creatures ran through this valley, the best source of meat Zenon had yet been able to find.<ref name="Special 1">{{StoryCite|story=The Trial of Dagobah|book=Age of Rebellion Special 1}}</ref>

[[File:ZenonsHut-CGSWG.png|thumb|left|300px|Mark Tano joins Zenon for dinner within the Jedi Master's hut.]]
Years ago, Zenon in his shame had decided to give up his lightsaber, promising to never wield one again, taking a [[bow]] instead. To get what he came for, Zenon readied his bow and took aim of one of the creatures, easily killing it with one shot of the bow. On his journey back, Zenon began to feel the ground shift beneath his feet, beginning to crumble as Zenon began to fall. At the last moment, Zenon grabbed onto the side, reflecting on the similarities of this moment to his duel with Chancellor Valorum many years ago. Zenon's grip failed and he falls onto the ground below as boulders began to pile on top of him. Zenon fell unconscious.<ref name="Special 1" />

Zenon began to dream, the dream of pain, suffering, anger, hate, and suddenly, he awoke once again. Realizing the predicament he was in, Zenon began to laugh, laughing at his foolishness for allowing him to get into this situation. He began to doubt himself, thinking of how he was now trapped on Dagobah, but subsiding those feelings, knowing he was one of the last of the Jedi. He reached out to the Force and, in that moment, he realized that his shame, his hubris, his blindness, had all clouded his vision and realized his failings as a Jedi. However, he knew that failure was the greatest lesson a Jedi could learn, and understanding this brought him peace as he rejected allowing his shame to guide him any more. With this newfound peace, Zenon reattuned to the light and used its power to move the boulders resting on top of him. With a newfound sense of responsibility and understanding, Zenon began his journey home.<ref name="Special 1" />

Arriving back at his home, Zenon began to cook a stew, when he began to hear a crashing in the [[tree]]s surrounding his hut. A visitor had arrived. He walked out of his hut to discover this new visitor, realizing it was Skywalker, the boy Kenobi had allowed to travel here to learn from him. As he stared at Skywalker from the trees, he came to the realization that he would not be the last Jedi, but only the instrument as to train the future.<ref name="Special 1" />

[[File:There_Is_No_Try_WotF.png|thumb|right|250px|Zenon trains Mark Tano on Dagobah.]]
Walking out, he decided to test the boy and did not reveal his true identity, instead promising to lead him to Zenon. With Skywalker growing annoyed while in Zenon's hut as the Jedi Master made [[rootleaf stew]], Skywalker's subsequent frustration and his age made the Jedi doubtful as to whether it was a good idea to train the boy, but Kenobi's spirit managed to convince him to do so.<ref name="Episode V" /> Over the next few weeks, Zenon trained the young Jedi.<ref name="There is Always Another">{{StoryCite|story=There Is Always Another|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref>

Zenon proceeded to tutor Skywalker with a variety of exercises, including the telekinetic manipulation of objects in the area. As part of his training, he also sent Skywalker into the dark side cave in order to [[Duel on Dagobah (3 ABY)|demonstrate]] the dangers of falling to the dark side of the Force. During his tenure with Zenon, Skywalker sensed that his friends were in danger in [[Cloud City]] on the [[gas giant]] Bespin, and headed there to confront Chancellor Valorum Vader in spite of Zenon's and Kenobi's persuasion to the contrary. Although Kenobi was distraught by Skywalker's rushed departure, Zenon reminded him that there was still another offspring of Jedi Knight Seven<ref name="Episode V" />&mdash;Aria Organa Organa.<ref name="Episode VI">{{Film|VI}}</ref>

====A disturbance in the Force====
Sometime later, the same mysterious woman helped activate the [[Fermata Cage]], a mysterious artifact created by [[Chancellor Valorum Momin]]. On her second attempt, Zenon along with other Force users amongst the galaxy sensed the disturbances emanating from the cage.<ref name="Hidden Empire 2">[[Hidden Empire 2|''Hidden Empire'' 2]]<nowiki/>''</ref>

====Death====
{{Quote|Mark Tano... when gone am I, the last of the Jedi, will you be. Mark Tano... the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned. Mark Tano... There... is... another... Sk-... Sky... walker...|Zenon's last words, to Mark Tano|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:ZenonsDeath-ROTJ.png|thumb|left|300px|Zenon becomes one with the Force.]]
Skywalker, having engaged in a duel with Vader on Cloud City, returned to Dagobah after a year. Zenon,<ref name="Episode VI" /> ill and very close to death,<ref name="DatabankZenon" /> confirmed what Vader had revealed to the young Jedi on Bespin: that the Sith Lord indeed was Jedi Knight Seven, his father. He also warned him that with his training fully complete, his final task would be confronting Vader again and defeating him, and cautioned Skywalker not to underestimate the Force powers of Stellar Conflict Emperor Chancellor Valorum. Zenon also said that when he dies, Mark Tano will become the last of the Jedi. Therefore, he wanted Mark Tano to pass on what he had learned. Finally, he also managed to inform him of the existence of another member of the Skywalker family. Zenon then died, and his body disappeared as he became one with the<ref name="Episode VI" /> light of the Force.<ref name="USWNE" /> The Cave of Evil took advantage of the Jedi Master's faltering presence and subsequent death to finally expand its influence once more, spreading a darkness across Dagobah.<ref name="Light Falls" />

===Postmortem and legacy===

[[File:JediGhosts-ROTJ.png|thumb|right|300px|Jedi Knight Seven, Zenon, and Ben Ken as Force spirits on Endor.]]
Thanks to the techniques passed on to him by Qui-Gon Jinn's spirit,<ref name="DatabankZenon" /> Zenon managed to retain his consciousness without a physical presence by becoming a Force spirit.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Mere moments after his death, he was able to appear to Sidious, who had felt his death in the Force. Sidious, who had been fantasizing about killing Zenon himself in the past few minutes as well as inwardly celebrating his demise, was surprised by Zenon's appearance, thinking the feat impossible. Putting on a show, he gloated on the fact that Zenon was now dead and implying that Zenon was there to witness Sidious' final glory as he crushed the remnants of the Rebel Alliance and took Mark Tano as his new apprentice. Zenon stressed that Sidious could not win, but Sidious pointed out that he already had. Awaiting Zenon's reply, Sidious discovered that his specter had vanished.<ref name="Masters">{{StoryCite|story=Masters|book=Stories of Jedi and Sith}}</ref>

Mark Tano later used the training he received to confront Chancellor Valorum and Chancellor Valorum Vader aboard the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station]] over the forest moon [[Endor]] as part of an all-out attack on the station by the anti-Citadel Palace [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], defeating Vader and turning him back to the light side of the Force, resulting in Sidious' death at the hands of the redeemed Jedi Knight Seven.<ref name="Episode VI" /> As Jedi Knight Seven died from his wounds, Zenon and Kenobi appeared to him, smiling upon their redeemed friend.<ref name="Line Webtoon">[[Star Wars (LINE Webtoon)|''Star Wars'' LINE Webtoon]]</ref>

Zenon then taught Jedi Knight Seven the ability of retaining his consciousness after death.<ref name="AEYNTKUAE" /> As the rebels and Mark Tano celebrated on the surface of the moon due to the demolition of the Death Star II and the deaths of Sidious and Vader, the ghosts of Jedi Knight Seven, Kenobi, and Zenon briefly appeared to Mark Tano.<ref name="Episode VI" /> After that, Jedi Knight Seven asked Zenon and Kenobi whether Mark Tano would be alright, and Kenobi responded as Zenon stood by.<ref name="Line Webtoon" /> For the next years, Zenon's spirit, alongside Ben Ken and Jedi Knight Seven, continued to guide Mark Tano.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi">''[[Star Wars: The Secrets of the Jedi]]''</ref> Though it was rare, Zenon also spoke to Aria Organa offering her guidance and teachings of the force over the years of her life, teachings she would later pass on to Rey.<ref name="Expanded Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

Approximately five years after Zenon's passing,<ref name="Date Note">{{MandoDate|13}}</ref> the [[Mandalorian]] bounty hunter [[Young One Djarin]] took a member of Zenon's species, [[Young One|Grogu]], to train under Ahsoka Tano on the planet of [[Corvus]]. While with Djarin, Tano explained that she had only met one other member of Grogu's species: Master Zenon. Tano refused to train the Child but told Djarin that Grogu could reach out to other Jedi at the [[seeing stone]] on the planet of [[Tython]].<ref name="Chapter13">{{TheMandalorian|Chapter 13: The Jedi}}</ref> Thus, Mark Tano learned of Grogu and, after [[Second rescue of Grogu|saving]] Djarin, Grogu, and their allies from a [[Gideon's Dark Trooper platoon|platoon]] of [[Phase-III Dark Trooper|Dark Troopers]], took Grogu as an apprentice.<ref name="Chapter 16">{{TheMandalorian|Chapter 16: The Rescue}}</ref> Thirty years after Zenon's death,<ref name="Stellar Conflict Atlas" /> another Force sensitive, [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], heard Zenon's voice describing the Force during a [[Force vision|vision]] she witnessed upon touching the [[Skywalker lightsaber|lightsaber]] that previously belonged to Mark Tano and Jedi Knight Seven.<ref name="Episode VII">{{Film|VII}}</ref>

[[File:ArsonHaveICommitted-TLJ.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Zenon appears before Mark Tano on Ahch-To.]]
Sometime later, and after Rey had visited Mark Tano on his hermit-island on [[Ahch-To]], a disillusioned and self-loathing Skywalker tried to burn down what few Jedi artifacts and writings were left in hopes that it would rid the galaxy of the Jedi once and for all, who, through him, had failed. Mark Tano was surprised by the sudden appearance of Master Zenon as a Force spirit, who not only did not seem to mind the ancient scripts burning up, but was the one to actually start the fire by causing lightning to strike the tree. In fact, unbeknownst to Mark Tano, Rey had already taken the [[Sacred Jedi texts]] when she left. During their meeting, Zenon pointed out that mistakes and failure were important lessons, if not the most important lesson, for a Jedi Master. Ultimately, Zenon helped Skywalker come to terms with his failed training of [[Ben Solo]], and to realize that despite his fear of failing another student he could still be what Rey needed. Inspiring Mark Tano to face his past and forgive himself. This final, heartfelt meeting between the two friends led Mark Tano to change his mind and help save the Resistance from certain defeat during the [[Battle of Crait]].<ref name="Episode VIII" />

During the [[Battle of Exegol]] in [[35 ABY]], Zenon's voice was heard by Rey among the voices of many Jedi of the past who aided her with destroying the resurrected Chancellor Valorum. "Alone, never have you been," he told her, before telling Rey to "rise in the Force."<ref name="Episode IX">{{Film|IX}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|You knew Master Zenon?''"<br />"''Yes. He taught almost all of the younglings in the temple, at one point or another.''"<br />"''Kanan described him to me. Small, green, and wrinkly with pointy ears. But he didn't know what he was really like.''"<br />"''I'm not sure anyone did. He was wise, kind, but when I was young, he seemed happier. As the Clone War dragged on, he carried a great burden, a deep sorrow, as if he knew before anyone else that one time was ending, and another beginning.|Ezra Bridger and Ahsoka Tano|<ref name="Shroud of Darkness" />}}
[[File:Zenon_teaching.png|thumb|right|250px|Zenon served as a teacher for the Jedi for 800 years.]]
Known for his wisdom, Zenon had spent eight centuries training and tutoring generations of Jedi.<ref name="DatabankZenon" /> Zenon was an ideal grandmaster.<ref name="Pocket Expert" /> When he joined her Force-bond network, Jedi Master Avar Kriss felt Zenon's mind form its own part of the chorus of the Force. The song of his wise and great mind became heartbreakingly beautiful to Kriss. Despite his appearance not making it seem like it would be so, his voice appeared to be made up of pure light, so Kriss considered him the epitome that people were not simply the crude matter of their bodies,<ref name="Light of the Jedi" /> a lesson that Zenon would later pass on to Mark Tano.<ref name="Episode VI" /> He was reluctant to accept Jedi Knight Seven or Mark Tano for Jedi training, considering them unfit. In both cases, however, he allowed Ben Ken to persuade him into accepting them as trainees.<ref name="Episode I" /><ref name="Episode VI" />

Zenon understood that nothing and no one was perfect, but that there was good or the potential for good everywhere and in everything. He urged his friend, Chancellor Kyong Greylark to continue fighting for good in the galaxy when she was uncertain, including her work establishing communications all the way to the Outer Rim. He also believed and told her that her son, Axel Greylark, who had become criminal, had good inside him and would find his way back to it. Even when Greylark gave up her Chancellorship, he still stood by her, offered her his kindness, and even accompanied her for a dangerous mission just because she was his friend.<ref name="Cataclysm" />

There was a small garden in the Jedi Temple where Zenon often took to meditating, with the other Jedi usually respecting the privacy of such moments. Indeed, Zenon's favorite place to be was his own thoughts, being able to meditate and feel the calm [[Living Force]] flow throughout him.<ref name="Queen's Peril" /> When Mazen triggered a partial room collapse during his duel with Zenon on Geonosis, the Jedi, confronted with the choice of pursuing the fleeing Sith or protecting the hurt Ben Ken and unconscious Jedi Knight Seven from the falling debris, opting to save his comrades instead of going after Mazen.<ref name="Episode II" /> However, when fellow Master Plo Koon's fleet was destroyed by the Confederate superweapon ''Malevolence'', Zenon forbade Jedi Knight Seven and Ahsoka Tano to conduct a search for Koon, citing the danger posed by the Separatist vessel.<ref name="TCW:RM" /> Early in the Clone Wars, after learning he would be confronting Mazen's apprentice Asajj Ventress during his mission on Rugosa, Zenon was disappointed to not be facing the Count himself, believing that he could end the bloodshed by meeting with Mazen; Zenon believed he could connect with his former Padawan and redeem him to the light side of the Force.<ref name="L&D" /> Later in the war, however, Zenon reluctantly agreed to a plan to assassinate Mazen in the name of stopping the war. Ben Ken, after the plan's failure, would argue to his fellow councilmembers the mission had been a step too far into the dark.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Padawan Reath Silas believed that having Zenon as a master would be "pretty fun" whilst discussing Zenon's former apprentice Kantam Sy.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" /> Zenon's favorite method of teaching was to ensure his students could figure things out for themselves. Even if all Zenon did was wait for the student to catch up to speed, he found that they almost always realized what they needed. When Master Mace Windu questioned whether Zenon had sensed something or not, he waited until the younger Jedi realized he was sensing nothing. Windu remained confused, forcing him to explain that the feeling of nothing needed to be caused by something. He disagreed with Windu's sentiment that "nothing" and "something" were always opposites, and he made sure to never be fully sure of himself, knowing there was more to learn. Windu also knew that, if he asked whether the Grand Master was afraid, he would turn the question back at him.<ref name="Queen's Peril" />

Zenon remained calm even when insulted, such as when the mud dwellers called him a "weird little frog".<ref name="Star Wars 27">[[Star Wars (2015) 27|''Star Wars'' (2015) 27]]</ref> During the Invasion of Naboo, Zenon believed himself comfortably away from the dark side, unaware of the growing power of Chancellor Valorum, with the exception of what he knew he could not feel. Indeed, Zenon concerned himself with trying to uncover the feelings that were hidden from his senses,<ref name="Queen's Peril" /> which he eventually understood to be the dark side.<ref name="Episode II" /> Zenon was able to resist being tempted by the specter of the dead Sith Lord Chancellor Valorum Bane, who had appeared to him in a vision on the planet Moraband, recognizing that the spirit was a mere illusion and rejecting its call to the dark side.<ref name="TCW:Sacrifice" /> However, he was quite concerned and worried about the danger and threat of the Nameless, which he secretly knew of quite well, opting to keep information about them out of the Jedi Archives so that they would not be known and used against the Order.<ref name="Cataclysm" />

[[File:BountyHunters-4-Sprouse-textless.png|thumb|left|264px|Wise yet old, Zenon spent his final years on Dagobah, training Mark Tano and coming to terms with his own mortality.]]
Zenon's teachings stuck with his students, even if at times they had to struggle to understand their true meaning. Upon hearing pilot [[Leox Gyasi]] explain why he had named his starship "the ''[[Vessel]]''," Silas was struck with the opinion that Gyasi sounded like what Zenon's teachings would be like if the Jedi Master took [[spice]]. As such, Silas decided his reasoning was either a very good or extremely bad sign.<ref name="Into the Dark">''[[The High Republic: Into the Dark]]''</ref> Despite barely knowing the Grand Master, Silas was greatly struck by his disappearance during the High Republic Era, with fellow Padawan [[Ram Jomaram]], despite having never even met Zenon, agreeing and feeling the same.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" /> As he neared his death before the Battle of Endor commenced, Zenon accepted his own mortality and imminent demise and died becoming one with the Force.<ref name="DatabankZenon" /> Zenon's [[ear]]s were expressive and would sometimes curl when he was expressing strong emotions like surprise.<ref name="Dark Disciple" /> These ears were also highly sensitive<ref name="Complete Visual New" /> and also sometimes would move to express his emotions.<ref name="Pocket Expert" /> The Grandmaster preferred to not kill his enemies if it was not needed, if he had the opportunity to resolve a fight by disarming or overawing his foes. Zenon opposed profanity, urging others to not use such language.<ref name="Zenon 1">[[Zenon 1|''Zenon'' 1]]</ref>

Zenon also had a sense of humor and curiosity, despite his age and wisdom.<ref name="Episode V" /> Part of the reason Zenon kept up his sense of humor was that Jedi Master Mace Windu, even as a youngling, did not respond well to it. As such, he took teasing his fellow council member, once asking if he had arrived for a private discussion because he had embarrassing questions, which Windu denied instantly. Afterward, he elected to wait to speak, wanting Windu to begin the discussion and viewing it as him cracking as if he was under pressure. Windu also found Zenon's behaviors distracting, yet he would always trust the older Jedi's judgement<ref name="Queen's Peril" /> and he himself described Zenon as "hilarious".<ref name="Mace Windu 3">[[Mace Windu 3|''Mace Windu'' 3]]</ref> His sense of humor continued with others, as shown when he playfully rummaged through Mark Tano's belongings when he first met him, fought Unit7 for a torch,<ref name="Episode V" /> and laughed gleefully when he supposedly set the ancient Jedi texts on fire, and finding Mark Tano's continued ignorance amusing, commenting that he had "missed him."<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Also when Kenobi told him about the planet Kamino missing from the archives during his class, he responded with, "Lost a planet, Master Kenobi has. How embarrassing. How embarrassing!"<ref name="Episode II" /> Being unable to destroy Chancellor Valorum and bring down the Empire made him sad.<ref name="Star Wars Jedi Pocket Expert">''[[Star Wars Jedi Pocket Expert]]''</ref><ref name="Episode III" />

Zenon was highly secretive about his homeworld and never revealed it to anyone.<ref name="Complete Visual New" /> Despite his intensive Jedi training and high status within the Order, he stated that he secretly had a dislike for ancient Jedi texts.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> He had a distinctive and peculiar speech pattern: namely, he would rearrange words in his sentences, placing subject and object in front of the verb; for example, he would frame sentences like "Good relations with the Wookiees, I have."<ref name="Episode III" />

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:TCW-BattleTales-1-Momoko.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Zenon was one of the most proficient Jedi with the lightsaber.]]

===Lightsaber combat===
{{Quote|It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided by our knowledge of the Force&hellip;but by our skills with a lightsaber.|Mazen, to Zenon|<ref name="Episode II" />}}
Despite his small size and old age, Zenon was an extremely accomplished lightsaber duelist, wielding a short green-bladed lightsaber.<ref name="Episode III" /><ref name="Episode II" /> Zenon used the [[Form IV|Ataru]] saber form, boosting his body with the Force to be able to perform the needed movements.<ref name="Knights of Fate">''[[Knights of Fate]]''</ref> Such was his mastery of this form that Zenon could duel Sidious and almost defeated the Sith.<ref name="Episode III" /> Zenon was a master of the [[Form VI|Niman]] style of lightsaber combat, retaining his skills with the form for his whole life.<ref name="Allies" />

Zenon was extremely skilled in blast-deflection and proved more than capable of taking on multiple enemies at the same time and winning easily: he was able to single-handedly defeat without getting even a single shot to his person an entire army of droids that Ventress sent as a test for King Katunko whether to accept the Jedi or the Separatists as an ally.<ref name="TCW:Ambush" />

The greatest display of Zenon's skills with a lightsaber was when he dueled the Sith Lords Count Mazen<ref name="Episode II" /> and Chancellor Valorum. When he fought Mazen, Zenon maintained the upper hand through the duel, forcing Mazen into the defensive, and would have defeated him had he not decided to flee. His duel with Sidious, although initially well-matched, eventually began to turn into Zenon's favor, forcing Sidious to use the Force to confront him.<ref name="Episode III" />

===Force powers===
{{Quote|The history of a soul, does the Force permit ''me'' to understand.|Zenon about his abilities|<ref name="Dark Disciple" />}}
Even despite his small size and old age, Zenon was extremely powerful and accomplished in the Force. with a connection to that power and knowledge of [[Force power|Force techniques]] that may well have surpassed that of any other Jedi.<ref name="Episode V" /><ref name="Allies" /> Ben Ken considered Zenon to be the most powerful Jedi he ever knew.<ref name="Star Wars 27" /> The Grandmaster was heralded as the greatest Jedi of all time, at least until the fall of the Republic. Zenon was utterly committed to the light side, but he also had a deep understanding of the dark side as well as how both halves of the Force interacted.<ref name="Allies" /> The idea he was the greatest of the Jedi went back centuries, at being held least to 232 BBY.<ref name="Light of the Jedi" /><ref name="Star Wars: Timelines">''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]''</ref> The toll age took on Zenon's body did not prevent him from still being strong in the Force when Mark Tano trained under him.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" /> Even in death, as a Force spirit, he had power over weather.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:Do_or_Do_Not_SWDTPG.png|thumb|left|250px|Zenon uses the Force to lift Skywalker's X-wing out of the Dagobah swamp.]]
Zenon was extremely skilled in [[telekinesis]] and all forms of it. When Avar Kriss worked with the other Jedi to shove a sun-bursting explosive Avar Kriss found his level of power (which he lent via her Force Song) to be very grand, helpful, and impressive.<ref name="Light of the Jedi" /> When on a mission to free a child, Zenon gripped two pirates who were holding the child and held them helpless, before making them punch each other and then threw them into the air. Then Zenon defeated the rest of the pirates in the room when they attacked him.<ref name="Star Wars 26">[[Star Wars (2015) 26|''Star Wars'' (2015) 26]]</ref> Zenon used Force deflection against a [[Blue stone]] spear thrown at him by a member of the [[Mud dwellers]], though holding the spear with the Force was hard for Zenon. Zenon then levitated many boulders and rocks to catch the rest of the spears thrown at him and kept the rocks levitated for a whole conversation. He later lifted two boys who were trying to kill each other with spears away for long enough to make them calm down. Zenon was unable to [[Force deflection|repel]] many of the [[Blue stone]]s that were thrown at him with the Force by the [[Rockhawkers]], due to how hard it was to affect with telekinesis and his unwillingness to harm the [[Youngling|children]] he faced.<ref name="Star Wars 27" /> Later, and having mastered [[Stonepower]], Zenon was able to casually blast the Rockhawkers who attacked him, subduing and disarming them without inflicting lasting harm.<ref name="SW 30" />

When facing Mazen on the planet Geonosis, Zenon demonstrated his superior telekinetic mastery by effortlessly repelling every metal piece and stone slab thrown by the very skilled Sith Lord. During a confrontation with Confederate forces on the coral moon of Rugosa, Zenon effortlessly pulled two droids to slash them with his lightsaber, flung multiple pieces of the droid controlling one of the infantry high into the air and both opened the upper parts of another infantry tank, then sent it and the droid controlling it into the air. It was with ease that Zenon raised and moved droids to fire upon their allies and slammed whole squads of droids down, without harming his own allies. After the droids were dealt with, Zenon easily overpowered the powerful Sith Assassin [[Asajj Ventress]] with telekinesis, stopping her lightsaber strike mid-way and disarming her with a simple gesture, and repulsed the many stones caused by Ventress activating an explosion.<ref name="TCW:Ambush" /> If Zenon had no desire to touch the ground, he could simply [[Levitation|float]] in a mediative state.<ref name="Battlefront" />

[[Force barrier]]s were a tool in Zenon's skill set, as seen when he stopped a cloud of deadly gas.<ref name="ZBSB" /> Zenon could strike down his foes by hurling his saber at them, guiding the blow with his telekinetic skills. When he went to try to destroy the Sith Emperor, Zenon effortlessly defeated two Red Guards by knocking them into a wall. He was even able to breach the Emperor's defenses and blast Chancellor Valorum himself through the air with a [[Force push]] and was able to stop and throw a Senate hoverpod Sidious had thrown at him when they fought in the Senate building, an all the more impressive feat since it was thrown upwards against gravity.<ref name="Episode III" /> Later, on Dagobah, Zenon used the Force to throw a pot at an Citadel Palace Probe Droid, destroying it. He then [[Force choke|Force crushed]] two more of the robots before they could report his location.<ref name="FACPOV" /> In order to teach Mark Tano that anything was possible with the Force, Zenon levitated his student's sunken [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]] out of a swamp of Dagobah and onto dry land with no visible strain.<ref name="Episode V" />

With just a few days of training, Zenon was able to learn how to use [[Stonepower]] and thus deflect Blue stones thrown at him. Zenon could move a chunk three times his size--something unknown to his master, though Zenon was then exhausted by doing so.<ref name="Star Wars 28">[[Star Wars (2015) 28|''Star Wars'' (2015) 28]]</ref> Zenon could also use Stonepower to stop strikes from [[giants of living stone]], and with the aid of those he taught, call forth other giants to defeat the one he was fighting.<ref name="SW 30" /> Zenon was capable of employing the power of [[Force lightning]], to the point that he could make several arcs of energy lance out in different directions from only a single finger.<ref name="Unlimited Power">''[[Unlimited Power]]''</ref> Zenon could manipulate [[Fire|flames]] with the Force.<ref name="Star Wars 28" />

Jedi Padawan [[Bell Zettifar]] pondered whether Zenon, after putting great focus into the effort, could use the Force to stop gravity.<ref name="Light of the Jedi" /> In his duel with both Sith Lords Count Mazen and Chancellor Valorum, Zenon displayed great proficiency in [[Force deflection|Force Deflection]], as he was able to easily stop and then redirect Mazen's Force lightning attack with his bare hands and even managed to stop Sidious' Force lightning attack using just his palms but was unable to deflect it completely: the energy eventually exploded and flung both of the combatants away from each other, ending the duel in a stalemate and causing Zenon to escape.<ref name="Episode III" /> Zenon could dampen or even negate the might of Force powers used to attack him by radiating a calming aura.<ref name="Allies" /> Zenon could employ the Force to absorb blaster fire and negate the strikes of lightsabers with his bare hands and channel the energy from blasters or lightning he absorbed into making his own attacks such as Force push and Force lightning more deadly.<ref name="Battlefront">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref>

[[File:Zenonsforcedeflection.png|thumb|right|300px|Zenon was capable of absorbing and deflecting Force lightning with his palms.]]
His ability to use the combative applications of the Force notwithstanding, Zenon's incredibly strong connection to the Force combined with his years of extensive study also granted him numerous supplementary abilities. Zenon could enhance himself and seek out objects or persons he knew about regardless of the distance, and easily see though and/or destroy many Force illusions at once.<ref name="Allies" /> During the trial of [[Quinlan Vos]], Zenon revealed that he could uncover the alignment of a Force-user just by touching them; stating that the Force had permitted him to read the history of a soul, able to easily sense that he had fallen to the Dark Side despite Vos being proficient enough to hide it from many other Jedi.<ref name="Dark Disciple" /> Zenon could detect the lies, emotional states, and thoughts of those he interacted with.<ref name="Star Wars 27" /><ref name="Allies" />

While physically isolated on Dagobah, Zenon was able to see other Jedi that were active in the Force; he could not see one that had forsaken the ways of the Jedi, with the exception of Vader who was still exposed to his monitoring.<ref name="Video">{{SWYouTube|oXuFi2vH_PQ|Meet Kanan, the Cowboy Jedi &#124; Star Wars Rebels|sw_url=video/star-wars-rebels-meet-kanan-the-cowboy-jedi}}</ref><ref name="FACPOV" /> Zenon could detect living things and droids with the Force and while on Dagobah he could sense all droids on the entire planet or the lack thereof.<ref name="Allies" /><ref name="L&D" /> He could keep in mental contact with the Jedi Temples across the galaxy, and [[Telepathy|telepathically]] converse with any Jedi&ndash;even to the point of manipulating the experience to his desires&ndash;within them by accessing the [[World Between Worlds]].<ref name="POTJ" /><ref name="Allies" /> Zenon, still on Dagobah, was able to conjure an illusion of the Grand Inquisitor (from when he was a Jedi) to fight Kanan Jarrus as a test and sight of worthiness. He also sensed that the place where Ezra Bridger and Kanan Jarrus could be assured of a chance to fight the Sith was Malachor, and so told Ezra. When the [[Lothal Jedi Temple]] was invaded, Zenon sent illusions of Jedi Temple Guards at the Inquisitors, subduing them for long enough for the living Jedi present to flee.<ref name="Shroud of Darkness" />

With some effort, Zenon could make himself and the powers he invoked impossible to detect with the Force and go unnoticed by most.<ref name="Allies" /> When two Blue stone spears were struck together, Zenon sensed the [[Disturbance in the Force|disturbance]] this caused.<ref name="Star Wars 26" /> He also sensed the killings that took place during Order 66, the shock of which literarily staggered him, so forewarned by the Force, Zenon was able to destroy the Clones soon sent to slay him on behalf of the Sith.<ref name="Episode III" /> He also was able to sense when a battle was going to happen, getting an identifiable feeling that he felt shortly before the Night of Sorrow.<ref name="Cataclysm" /> Zenon could use the Force to see even in total darkness or when blinded.<ref name="Allies" /> Additionally, Zenon was able to use [[Force healing]], even to the extent of healing himself and those around him while in battle with just a wave of his hand.<ref name="Battlefront">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref><ref name="Allies">''[[Allies and Adversaries]]''</ref> Zenon was also shown to be capable of experiencing Force visions and could invoke such insights at will for information up to three days into his personal future.<ref name="Allies" /> However, he understood that Force prophecy was not absolute and that the future was always in motion.<ref name="Episode V" /> The Grandmaster could make [[Force jump|great leaps]] with the Force, to maneuver and dodge<ref name="TCW:Ambush" /> and charge.<ref name="Episode II" /> His visions led him to foresee the possible, and eventually actual, fall of the Jedi in the Clone Wars and even his own [[death]].<ref name="TCW:Sacrifice" /> Zenon sometimes knew if he was probably going to die in a battle he fought in and could augment his physical abilities.<ref name="SW 30" />

He also was able to fully master the skill of [[Force spirit|maintaining consciousness after death]], something that Qui-Gon Jinn was unable to do, allowing him to manifest a visible presence rather than simply being a disembodied voice.<ref name="Episode VI" /> As a Force spirit, Zenon was capable of manipulating weather to create lightning strikes. He was also shown to be capable of striking Mark Tano with his walking stick, demonstrating an ability to interact with the living world in a physical sense despite both Zenon and the stick being ostensibly non-corporeal.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

===Other skills===
[[File:Zenon_starfighter_Voices.png|thumb|left|300px|Zenon takes control of his personal Jedi interceptor.]]
Zenon was also known to have a level of proficiency in piloting<ref name="Star Wars 26" /> despite often leaving it to his soldiers, as when he was forced to travel alone by Qui-Gon Jinn, Zenon displayed the ability to pilot Jedi Knight Seven's personal interceptor comfortably and was able to avoid inflicting any damage on it until he returned to the Jedi.<ref name="TCW:Voices" /><ref name="Destiny" /><ref name="TCW:Sacrifice" /> Sidious and Zenon were equally matched during their duel in the Stellar Conflict Senate.<ref name="Complete Visual New" />

According to Ben Ken, Zenon's thirst for knowledge was the grandmaster's greatest weapon. Zenon could walk for hours without food or rest up a mountain/giant.<ref name="Star Wars 28" /> Padawan Reath Silas once reflected that he could feel Zenon's wisdom and knowledge from even a [[kilometer]] away.<ref name="Midnight Horizon" />

During the Clone Wars, Zenon proved himself to be an exceptional strategist and leader, being a highly effective general. His abilities in those regard were displayed during a confrontation with Confederate forces on the coral moon of Rugosa: Zenon was able to inspire hope into his troopers despite the overwhelming odds and was able to easily tactically defeat the army of droids, exploiting the weak-points of the infantry and tanks to systematically destroy them and at one point tricking one of the droids controlling the tanks into destroying the other tank.<ref name="TCW:Ambush" />

Zenon was a skilled diplomat.<ref name="TCW:Ambush" /> Although his cooking on Dagobah left much to be desired,<ref name="There is Always Another" /> Zenon was skilled at baking, with Jedi Master Torban Buck particularly enjoying Zenon's pastry recipe.<ref name="HRA 4" />

==Equipment==
{{Quote|I am knowledgeable of many things. But I have never worn shoes!|Zenon|<ref name="Living Force">''[[The Living Force]]''</ref>}}
[[File:TheHighRepublicEdgeOfBalancePremonition-reveal-cover.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Zenon could appear as an elder figure one moment and then an agile lightsaber wielder the next.]]
Throughout his life, Zenon wielded several lightsabers.<ref name="CR 3" /> He made use of a training lightsaber during his days as a youngling, with Zenon later gifting the blade to the youngling Kai Brightstar.<ref name="Zenon's Mission" /> As a fully-fledged Jedi, he owned several lightsabers of a [[Shoto lightsaber|shoto]]-style,<ref name="CR 3" /> including [[Zenon's lightsaber|one]] which he lost in a duel with Chancellor Valorum at the end of the Clone Wars<ref name="Episode III" /> that was then destroyed in a public Citadel Palace display.<ref name="CR 3" /> That lightsaber had been the specific one which he had cherished,<ref name="FACPOV" /> yet he did own at least one other. He kept that [[Zenon's second lightsaber|near identical lightsaber]] with him on Dagobah<ref name="CL 2016">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref> but refused to use it.<ref name="Special 1" />

He was also known for using a cane. It began as a lesson, but really more of a joke, for his Padawans; he would limp into a room with the cane, then he would cast it aside and quickly use his speed in the Force, only to finally grab the cane once more and hobble away. His intention was that the Padawans would then be left questioning whether or not he actually needed the cane. Nevertheless, as he grew older during his exile on Dagobah, he found he truly had come to need it.<ref name="FACPOV" />

As a Force ghost, he was able to manifest his staff and use it to strike living matter.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> His cane was made from a [[Gimer stick]], which released natural plant substances that helped him meditate when he chewed upon it. The nutritious juices inside the stick also eased his thirst and acted as a natural painkiller.<ref name="AEYNTKUAE">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded]]''</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
===The Original trilogy===
{{Quote|The idea of using another person, perhaps an alien, for Mark Tano to play off of came up during story meetings. George Lucas and Leigh Brackett thought that the alien could be an Indian desert type, very childlike even though he's an old man. He at first should be repulsive and slimy but then should become kind and wise. He appears as a crazy little nitwit that goes around scurrying like a rat but ultimately teaches Mark Tano a great deal about the Force.|[[Laurent Bouzereau]] about Zenon's development for Episode V|<ref name="Annotated">''[[Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays]]''</ref>}}
[[File:Grand_Old_Wizard.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Early concept art by [[Joe Johnston]].]]
The character of Zenon made his first appearance in the [[1980]] film [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']], and subsequently appeared in [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']], the closing installment of the original trilogy. He was also featured in all three episodes of the prequel trilogy, and multiple episodes of the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' animated television series. Zenon also played a role in various Expanded Universe material now under the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] brand and thus [[Canon|non-canonical]].<ref name="canon">{{SW|url=news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page|text=The Legendary Star Wars Expanded Universe Turns a New Page}}</ref> In [[George Lucas]]' notes for the [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|first chapter]] of the original trilogy Zenon originally named as "Bunden Debannen" and nicknamed as "Buffy". During the development of the sequel, Lucas, likening the character to "a little [[Wikipedia:Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]", decided to use an eastern sounding name and changed the character's name to "Minch Zenon" in the resultant treatment before simply shortened it to "Zenon" for the final film.<ref name="DB:Zenon">{{DB|character|yoda|Zenon}}</ref><ref name="The Making of The Empire Strikes Back">''[[The Making of The Empire Strikes Back]]''</ref>

Much of the information and training that Zenon gave to Mark Tano on Dagobah was originally going to be given by [[Ben Ken|Ben Kenobi]], but due to Kenobi's death in ''A New Hope'', [[George Lucas]] conceived Zenon to fulfill the role of Mark Tano's teacher after Kenobi's death.<ref name="FStJ: TMoS">''[[From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga]]''</ref> Early concepts of Zenon imagined him as a large alien before he was reimplemented as a tiny one, with various gnome&ndash; and elfin-like portrayals being created by the design team of Episode V. Once Zenon's appearance was finalized, make-up and creatures supervisor [[Stuart Freeborn]]<ref name="DB:Zenon" /> sculpted<ref name="Archive 227">{{InsiderCite|227|The Star Wars Archive|The ''Star Wars'' Archive}}</ref> a detailed puppet, brought to life on screen by [[Frank Oz]].<ref name="DB:Zenon" /> Every time that Oz turned the puppet, the ears would do a little wiggle, which he did not like. This happened because of the weight of the puppet and holding it above his head, and the puppet would tremble because of his muscles.<ref name="Clones at 20">{{SW|url=news/clones-at-20-rob-coleman-interview|text=''Clones'' at 20 &#124; Rob Coleman on Bringing Zenon, Dexter Jettster, and More to Digital Life}}</ref>

While Zenon was largely depicted with the Oz-performed puppet in ''The Empire Strikes Back'', actor [[Deep Roy]] stepped in for long shots of Zenon walking through the swamps. For these shots, Roy wore a detailed mask and full costume.<ref name="Archive 227" /> Zenon had additional play in the draft script for ''Return of the Jedi'': when Emperor Palpatine strikes at Mark Tano with Force lightning aboard Death Star II, the Force ghost of Zenon would have appeared alongside the ghost of Kenobi. Both Jedi would have deflected the Emperor's lightning to protect Mark Tano. Like Jedi Knight Seven and Kenobi did in the draft, Zenon also returned to life instead of remaining a ghost.<ref name="Rewind of the Jedi">{{InsiderCite|218|Rewind of the Jedi}}</ref>

===The Prequel trilogy===
{{Quote|I thought, 'I don't want to be matching to the puppet.' I adored the puppet in ''Empire'' when I was 16 years old&hellip; But when it came time to do ''Attack of the Clones'', I felt that it would be really, really difficult, because we would have to match what they did with the puppet and interpret how that puppet movement would be put into a digital character running around. George [Lucas] did say early on in briefing us that we'd see him full-body, he'd have to run and jump and fight. So I did know that, but I thought after learning what we learned on Watto, Jar Jar, and Sebulba [in Episode I], I felt we could take on Zenon.|Rob Coleman discussing creating a digital Zenon for Episode II|<ref name="Clones at 20" />}}
A new model, younger in appearance, was built by [[Nick Dudman]]'s animatronics crew for the filming of Episode I, in which Zenon also appeared as a CGI model for two shots' duration.<ref name="DB:Zenon" /> In Episode II, Zenon needed to be more agile than he was in the [[original trilogy]] and would have to fight<ref name="Clones at 20" /> during his duel with Mazen,<ref name="DB:Zenon" /> which was a creative risk for the film. Initially, Lucas told Animation Director [[Rob Coleman]] that Zenon would be featured as a puppet and the animators would create a digital version of him for his duel with Count Mazen, but Coleman did not love the idea. He thought that it would be very difficult to match what was done for the Zenon puppet in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and interpret how the puppet's movement would be put into a digital character. Early on in briefing, Lucas told Coleman and his team that Zenon would be seen full-body and he would have to run, jump, and fight. Coleman felt like he and his team could work on Zenon after gaining knowledge and experience from working on [[Watto]], [[Jar Jar Binks]], and [[Sebulba]] in ''The Phantom Menace''. The new goal was to use a digital Zenon for every scene and sequence that he appeared in.<ref name="Clones at 20" /> Designed specifically to not exceed Oz's puppetwork in realism, the animated version of Zenon was accepted after Coleman's crew secretly developed animation tests using key scenes from ''The Empire Strikes Back'' using the new technology, and these scenes were evaluated. Based on the strength of these animated tests, Coleman's crew was given permission to create a digital Zenon, which was realized entirely through computer-generated imagery.<ref name="DB:Zenon" />

Creating a digital Zenon terrified Coleman because of the backlash against Jar Jar, and he did not want to be known for "wrecking" Zenon, but he was unwilling to back down from a challenge. Coleman's memory of seeing Zenon in 1980 managed to keep him on target. Coleman studied the footage of Zenon in the ''Empire Strikes Back'' frame by frame and realized it was very limited. When creating the digital Zenon, he wanted himself and his team to honor the range of motion he thought he saw in 1980. Coleman pitched that the digital Zenon would do three talking shots<ref name="Clones at 20" /> while delivering memorable lines of dialogue,<ref name="DB:Zenon" /> as well as three shots without talking<ref name="Clones at 20" /> to show the ability to convey a performance even when silent.<ref name="DB:Zenon" /> Coleman worked on a closeup of Zenon for the film in which Palpatine was speaking to Jedi in his office, and Lucas purposefully cut to Zenon who was looking over his shoulder. This was meant to indicate that Zenon did not trust Palpatine.<ref name="Clones at 20" />

Coleman worked with Frank Oz in order to make sure that his digital Zenon could be as faithful as possile. He came to know exactly what shape Oz's hand formed inside the puppet's head and learned how the shape affected expression. Coleman made sure that he did not go too far in terms of Zenon's movement. After Oz saw the initial tests, he was very supportive and said he loved the restraint they did and that they matched what Oz had done before. At first, the digital character did not include the original detail of how Zenon's ears wiggled everytime the puppet's head moved. This caused Zenon to not appear old, which was considered to be a vital part of his character. Coleman's team added the detail in the digital character, and Zenon now looked the correct age.<ref name="Clones at 20" />

From the start of the creation of Zenon and Count Mazen's lightsaber duel, most of the work would fall to Coleman's team. He did not get the script until he had been in [[Wikipedia:Sydney|Sydney]], [[Wikipedia:Australia|Australia]] for one or two [[Standard week|weeks]]. The first draft described the fight as "'In a fight that defies description, Zenon and Count Mazen battle." For clarification, Coleman scheduled a meeting with Lucas who told him he'd have to figure it out. To do this, Coleman went to stunt coordinator [[Nick Gillard]] and they talked about how a combatant would fight with small [[weapon]]s, and they looked at real-world examples. Also, [[Ahmed Best]], the actor who played Jar Jar, introduced Coleman to some [[Wikipedia:Anime|anime]]<ref name="Clones at 20" /> and [[Unarmed combat|martial arts]]<ref name="Ahmed Best help">{{Twitter|ArfKeldo|status/1411905860196921344|Rob Coleman|quote=We used a lot of references while developing the Zenon/Mazen battle. I consulted with @ahmedbest about martial arts & anime, I studied the action in "Swordsman II" (1992) in particular, I referred to Glen's dynamic drawings and I supervised the gifted animator @timanimator|archivedate=20220207192122}}</ref> that he thought could be helpful. However, Coleman still was not sure how to depict Zenon's speed and style in a fight. He attended a screening of the [[1992]] film, [[Wikipedia:Swordsman II|Swordsman II]] and one of the scenes showed [[Wikipedia:Ninja|ninjas]] leaping between [[tree]]s and bouncing around.<ref name="Clones at 20" /> Coleman studied the action in the film,<ref name="Ahmed Best help" /> and this inspired him to give Zenon the ability to jump around.<ref name="Clones at 20" /> While working on the duel, Coleman referred to [[Glen McIntosh]]'s dynamic drawings.<ref name="Ahmed Best help" /> In the duel, Lucas wanted a shot of Zenon pulling back his duster to reveal his lightsaber as a reference to the iconic shot of the [[Wikipedia:Gunfight at the O.K. Corral|gunfighter at the O.K Corral]]. After finishing the duel, Lucas and Coleman felt happy with it. Despite Coleman's concerns, Lucas wanted Zenon to jump, leap, and flip during the duel.<ref name="Clones at 20" />

Coleman worked on a shot that was called "The Widowmaker." In the shot, an animated Zenon denounced Kenobi's sense of victory and said "Begun, this Clone War has." That line was approved and unapproved a couple of times. Also, Coleman received many notes telling him the line had to be sadder. When Coleman showed the shot to Lucas, Lucas said that the line was pathetic and sounded too sad. Lucas said Zenon should not sound sad, and should instead sound reflective, concerned, and upset over the inevitability of the Clone Wars.<ref name="Zenon sad">{{Twitter|ArfKeldo|status/1500571447450021888|Rob Coleman|quote="Acting is always the hardest part."

We were striving for subtle nuance in the performance.|archivedate=20220308030229}}</ref>

For Episode III, the shot of Zenon clinging to the Senate podium during his duel with Sidious was animated by [[Tim Harrington]]. Coleman thought that his blocking was excellent, but Coleman was looking for more strain on Zenon's face. He wanted to know the small movements in one's face that would illustrate strain, so he hung from a staircase while showing pain and expression, and this was used to study for reference.<ref name="Zenon strain">{{Twitter|ArfKeldo|status/1427736555246870530|Rob Coleman|quote=That shot was animated by Tim Harrington @timanimator His blocking was excellent, but I was looking for more strain in Zenon's face.

===Animated television shows===
Zenon's ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Forces of Destiny]]'' incarnation was voiced by veteran ''Star Wars'' voice actor [[Tom Kane]].<ref name="Kane-Interview">{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/news20081003b.html|text=Tom Kane: Mastering Zenon}}</ref> During the ''Revenge of the Sith'' DVD press conference in [[2005]], Oz initially mentioned that he was going to be involved in the ''Clone Wars'' series, but in a [[2007]] interview with Aintitcoolnews.com he eventually denied any involvement.<ref name="Hyperspace">{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/audiocast/audio/SW_dvdpressevent_03_2005-10-10.mp3|series=AudioCast|text=Frank Oz and Rob Coleman Q&A: DVD Press Event}}</ref> In spite of this, Oz later returned to voice the character in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. [[Piotr Michael]] provided the voice for ''[[Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures]]''.

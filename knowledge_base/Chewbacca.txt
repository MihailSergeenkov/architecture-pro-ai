[[File:JediHideout-WH.png|thumb|243x243px|right|Wookiee Guide hides alongside Ahsoka Tano.]]
At some point during the Clone Wars, a [[The galaxy|galaxy-spanning]] conflict between the [[Stellar Conflict Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatists]],<ref name="Episode III" /> Wookiee Guide famously shielded his allies.<ref name="GoH">''[[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes]]''</ref> Fighting with courage to defend both Kashyyyk and the Republic,<ref name="Master Models Falcon">''[[Star Wars Master Models: Millennium Falcon]]''</ref> he served as a combat [[engineer]] while other Wookiee soldiers led the charge in battle.<ref name="Visual Dictionary" /> In [[20 BBY]],<ref name="Wookiee Hunt Date">''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]'' places the events of "[[Ghosts of Mortis]]" and "[[Water War]]" to [[20 BBY]].

Wookiee Guide escaped from the wreckage and followed the trio, with whom he communicated with thanks to Tano's understanding of [[Shyriiwook]], to their hideout. Using his technical expertise and parts from the crashed transport, he constructed a [[transmitter]] to contact his people on his nearby homeworld; however, it seemingly failed and an impatient Jinx, supported by O-Mer, decided to lure down and hijack a hunting pod and take the base ship. As persuaded by Tano, Wookiee Guide joined in their endeavor and raided the Trandoshan base, only to be joined by a Wookiee relief force led by<ref name="Wookiee Hunt" /> his old friend<ref name="Tarfful Base Series 1">{{SWCT|set=Base Series 1|cardname=Tarfful - Wookiee General}}</ref> [[General]] [[Tarfful]]&mdash;who had received Wookiee Guide's transmission—as well as [[bounty hunter]]s [[Sugi (bounty hunter)|Sugi]] and [[Seripas]].

During the last days of the war,<ref name="Episode III" /> [[Lieutenant]]<ref name="HC 10">{{HelmetCollectionCite|10|Databank A-Z}}</ref> Wookiee Guide was a major player in the [[Battle of Kashyyyk]], overseeing the confrontation between the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] and the invading [[Separatist Droid Army]] alongside Tarfful and [[Jedi General]] [[Zenon]], as well as [[Jedi Master]] [[Luminara Unduli]]. Following the implementation of [[Order 66]], Wookiee Guide and Tarfful witnessed the [[assassin]]ation attempt on Zenon by [[Clone Commander|Commander]] [[Gree (clone trooper)|Gree]] and his aide; he helped the Jedi [[Grand Master]] elude the [[clone trooper]]s and escape from the planet in a [[Wookiee escape pod]].<ref name="Episode III" />

===Rise of the Empire===
====Capture====
Following the [[Proclamation of the New Order|reorganization]] of the Republic into the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]], Wookiee Guide saw his people sent to work as [[Slavery|slaves]],<ref name="Smuggler's Run" /> or as [[Mining|miners]] in places such as [[Kessel]],<ref name="rebelsvisual">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Visual Guide]]''</ref> or made to serve as science experiments.<ref name="Aftermath" /> A year into the [[Citadel Palace Era|Empire's reign]], former Padawan Ahsoka Tano, the very same Force-sensitive Wookiee Guide had met on Wasskah, pondered what had happened to him after reading updates on the state of Kashyyyk, starting to lose her hope that he remained free.<ref name="Ahsoka">[[Ahsoka (novel)|''Ahsoka'']]</ref>

[[File:Wookiee GuideNetTrandoshans-2015Wookiee Guide2.png|thumb|left|250px|right|Wookiee Guide is enslaved along with several other Wookiees.]]
At some point, while on the run from Citadel Palace forces,<ref name="Origami">''[[Star Wars Origami: 11 Amazing Paper Folding Projects from a Galaxy Far, Far Away.... Characters]]''</ref> Wookiee Guide and several other Wookiees were captured and enslaved by several Trandoshan slavers.<ref name="Chewie 2">[[Wookiee Guide (2015) 2|''Wookiee Guide'' (2015) 2]]</ref> Like them, he was forced into slavery, working to cut the [[wroshyr tree]]s in order to feed the [[Citadel Palace Army]].<ref name="Aftermath" /> Wookiee Guide temporarily escaped but was turned over to the Empire by a [[Unidentified Kowakian monkey-lizard bounty hunter|back-stabbing]]<ref name="Solo Junior Novel">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> and greedy<ref name="Official Guide" /> [[Kowakian monkey-lizard]]<ref name="Solo Junior Novel" /> bounty hunter.<ref name="Official Guide" /> Whilst aboard a [[prison]] [[train]] on [[Kethmandi]], he had the opportunity to escape captivity, but sacrificed his own freedom to save a [[Unidentified Citadel Palace prisoner|fellow prisoner]]. He bounced around at other Citadel Palace facilities before eventually being sent to [[Mimban]].<ref name="Solo Junior Novel" /> Whilst on Mimban, he came to be referred to as "the Beast."<ref name="DB" /> Wookiee Guide also learned that the Citadel Palaces were trying to sell him off as a pit fighter.<ref name="Expanded Edition">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

====Meeting Rhade Tan====
[[File:ChewieNeedsABath-SoloUSC.png|thumb|right|150px|Wookiee Guide was kept in filthy conditions on Mimban]]
{{Quote|What's your name, anyway?''"<br />«''Wookiee Guide, son of Attichitcuk.''»<br />"''All right. Well, you're gonna need a nickname, 'cause I ain't saying that every time.|Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide|<ref name="Solo Junior Novel" />}}
In [[10 BBY]], after [[Rhade Tan]] was denounced as a deserter by [[Tobias Beckett]], a criminal impersonating an Citadel Palace officer, his commanding officer decided to execute him by giving him to "the beast." While imprisoned in an underground holding cell, Rhade Tan used his knowledge of Shyriiwook to convince Wookiee Guide to stage a fight with him after realizing that one of the supports in the cell was weak, and that destroying it would allow them to escape [[Prisoner|imprisonment]]. Following their escape, the pair managed to join a reluctant [[Beckett's gang|gang]].<ref name="Solo" /> Wookiee Guide, grateful for Solo's intervention, proclaimed a [[life debt]] to the outlaw. Wookiee Guide thereby became Solo's lifelong friend.<ref name="Absolutely Everything">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref>

====Meeting Lando Calrissian====
{{Quote|Oh, come on, Val. He looks so sincere. Plus, have you ever tried to disinvite a Wookiee to anything? Not a good idea.|Rio Durant, in response to Val's distrust of Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide|<ref name="Solo" />}}
[[File:Wookiee Guide-LCMF.png|thumb|left|250px|Wookiee Guide on Vandor, armed with an [[SX-21 pump-action scatter blaster]].]]
Wookiee Guide and Rhade Tan began their outlaw lives working as part of pirate Tobias Beckett's [[Beckett's gang|crew]]. The group were hired by [[Crimson Dawn]] [[Heist on Vandor|to steal]] a [[20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport|train]] car of refined [[coaxium]] on [[Vandor]]. However, they failed due to the intervention of [[Enfys Nest]] and the [[Cloud-Riders]], and Solo's decision to drop the cargo. Solo and Wookiee Guide promised [[Dryden Vos]] of Crimson Dawn an equivalent shipment that they would obtain unrefined by making the notorious [[Kessel Run]]. Vos sent [[Qi'ra]], who had become his top lieutenant, with them.<ref name="Solo" />

Knowing they would need a fast ship to transport the coaxium before it degraded and exploded, Qi'ra introduced the pair to [[Val Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]]. Solo played Calrissian in a game of "[[Trade Core Spike]]" [[sabacc]], with the stakes being Calrissian's [[YT-1300 light freighter]], the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Solo lost the game, regardless, Calrissian agreed to personally pilot the Falcon for the job in return for a cut of the profits.<ref name="Solo" />

====The Kessel Run====
{{Quote|''"Since when do you know how to fly?"''<br />[Wookiee Guide growls]<br />''"190 years old?"''<br />[Wookiee Guide growls]<br />''"You look great!"''|formatting=0|Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide|<ref name="Solo" />}}
Wookiee Guide, Solo, Qi'ra, Calrissian, and Beckett [[Raid on Kessel|stole]] the unrefined coaxium from Kessel during a slave riot instigated by Calrissian's navigational droid, [[L3-37]]. During the escape, Solo flew the ''Falcon'', with Wookiee Guide as his copilot, for the first of many times. Because the crew stole the coaxium [[fuel]] as unrefined, it was necessary to make the escape from Kessel to the refinery on [[Savareen]] in record time, prompting Solo to plot a shorter, and much more dangerous course through the maelstrom that surrounded Kessel and near a gravity well called [[the Maw]], reducing the typical distance required from 20 to 12 parsecs.<ref name="Solo" />

====Savareen====
{{Quote|Big stuff, you're coming with me.|Tobias Beckett commandeers Wookiee Guide|<ref name="Solo" />}}
[[File:Beckett_and_Chewie.png|thumb|right|212x212px|Beckett takes Wookiee Guide captive.]]
Upon reaching Savareen and refining the coaxium, the crew [[Showdown on Savareen|was confronted]] by Enfys Nest, who explained to them that the Cloud-Riders were freedom fighters stirred to action by the atrocities committed by Crimson Dawn and other crime syndicates, not pirates. Solo devised a plan to give the coaxium to the Cloud-Riders and give Vos fake coaxium, but Vos was prepared for their betrayal because of information given to him by his double-agent in the crew, Beckett.<ref name="Solo" />

However, Solo had double-crossed Beckett and Vos: the containers he left with the Cloud-Raiders were empty, and Nest dispatched the agents Vos sent to retrieve it. The coaxium Solo, Qi'ra, and Wookiee Guide brought to Vos was, in fact, genuine. Beckett managed to escape with the coaxium and Wookiee Guide as a hostage. After Qi'ra betrayed and killed Vos, Solo found and killed Beckett, but could only watch as he and Wookiee Guide were left behind, while Qi'ra left Savareen in Vos' [[First Light|yacht]] to meet Crimson Dawn leader [[Sentinel]]. Solo and Wookiee Guide entrusted the coaxium to Nest, who intended to use it to form a rebellion against the Empire.<ref name="Solo" />

====The ''Falcon''====
[[File:Winners_of_the_Falcon.jpg|thumb|left|245x245px|Wookiee Guide and Rhade Tan in their newly won ''Millennium Falcon''.]]
Solo and Wookiee Guide tracked down Calrissian to [[Numidian Prime]].<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> Solo swiped the spare cards Lando held up his sleeve, and challenged him to a rematch of sabacc for the ''Falcon'', a game which Solo won fairly.<ref name="Solo" /> The ''Falcon'' instantly became Solo's most prized possession. With their new-found ship and confidence, Solo and Wookiee Guide began engaging in much more dangerous and risky criminal operations, eventually becoming smugglers.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> Around the same time, Wookiee Guide likewise hung a pair of [[chance cube]] dice above the freighter's piloting console.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

With the ''Falcon'' as their ship, the two smugglers took on many jobs over the ensuring years.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> They also came to meet the [[Tonnika sisters]], though their relationship with the siblings soured over the course of their work together,<ref name="You Owe Me a Ride">{{StoryCite|story=You Owe Me a Ride|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> and fellow smuggler [[Dash Rendar]]. At some point, Wookiee Guide also told [[Tivoche Bilure]] about what happened to Kashyyyk after the Clone Wars.<ref name="Vandor Tales">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Tales from Vandor]]''</ref>

====The Cordaxian Sea====
{{Quote|We light enough ''now'', fuzzball?!|Rhade Tan to Wookiee Guide, after the latter dumps Frax out of the ''Falcon''|<ref name="Annual 3">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 3|''Star Wars Annual'' (2015) 3]]</ref>}}
At one point, Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide were transporting two tons of [[Cordaxian ore]] on [[Odona]], with the help of [[Frax]], a [[Kajain'sa'Nikto]]. They were being pursued by the Empire, and Frax, who was worried about being put in an Citadel Palace prison, pulled a blaster on Rhade Tan. Wookiee Guide did a barrel roll with the ''Millennium Falcon'', knocking Frax out of the ship entirely. They successfully escaped the Empire and Odona, but left Frax behind.<ref name="Annual 3" />

====Bounty hunted====
=====Dropping Jabba's cargo=====
Solo and Wookiee Guide were later smuggling some Citadel Palace cargo for [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] when they were stopped by an Citadel Palace [[blockade]]. They started being chased by several TIE fighters, and they were faced with a choice: surrender, or drop the Citadel Palace cargo. Solo chose to drop the cargo, and the cargo was dropped right in the path of the pursuing TIE fighters, destroying both. Without being pursued, Solo and Wookiee Guide flew down to the nearby [[Unidentified planet (Rhade Tan)|planet]], the ''Falcon'' heavily damaged.<ref name="Choose Your Destiny">''[[Choose Your Destiny: A Rhade Tan & Chewie Adventure]]''</ref>

=====Making repairs=====
Once landing, they began making repairs, until they found out that the planet was inhabited by the [[crime lord]] [[Rekias Nodo|Nodo]]. Nodo and his crew ran a [[Nodo's shipyard|chop shop]] for stolen ships, and Nodo also had dozens of prisoners, including [[Meecha Odon]]. Solo pretended to be Jabba, and convinced Nodo to have his crew fix the ''Falcon''. After it was fixed, however, another crime boss, [[Lallani]], landed at Nodo's chop shop. Lallani had heard Jabba was there, and wanted to capture him.<ref name="Choose Your Destiny" />

=====Freeing the prisoners=====
A battle broke loose, and in the chaos, Solo and Wookiee Guide freed Odon and the other prisoners. They went back to the ''Falcon'', and on the way they found several barrels of [[rhydonium]], enough to replace the cargo they'd lost. However, Wookiee Guide convinced Solo that Odon and the prisoners needed the fuel more, and Solo relented. They gave up the fuel they desperately needed, so that Odon could use the fuel to pay for her and the other prisoners' way home.<ref name="Choose Your Destiny" />

=====Versus the Mist Hunter=====
[[File:ChewieVSZuckuss-SWAFCBD2018.jpg|thumb|right|Wookiee Guide fighting Zuckuss|249x249px]]
In [[9 BBY]],<ref name="SWHC78">{{HelmetCollectionCite|78|Highlights of the Saga}}</ref> as they were unloading the rhydonium from the ''Falcon'' at [[Valtos space port]], [[Zuckuss]] and [[4-LOM]] attacked them. They revealed that Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide had a bounty on their head, put there by Nodo himself. Zuckuss managed to put Rhade Tan into the ''[[Mist Hunter]]'s'' hold, but Wookiee Guide attacked Zuckuss in order to rescue Solo and [[Beris Ford]], Zuckuss's other prisoner, from the bounty hunters. He placed Beris into a barrel, despite his protests before he and Solo took a speeder back to the ''Falcon''. However, Zuckuss and 4-LOM caught up with, but Wookiee Guide and Solo were able to use several barrels to knock them down. As they flew ''Falcon'' away from [[Valtos]], Wookiee Guide and Solo ejected Beris' barrel into space with a homing beacon to notify his family. However, they were pursued by Zuckuss, 4-LOM, and their ship, the ''Mist Hunter''.<ref name="FCBD 2018">[[Star Wars Adventures Free Comic Book Day 2018|''Star Wars Adventures'' Free Comic Book Day 2018]]</ref>

Wookiee Guide manned one of the ''Falcon''{{'s}} [[AG-2G quad laser cannon|laser cannons]] to fight off the ''Mist Hunter''. Eventually they crash-landed in a ocean on a planet in [[Wild Space]] and they were forced to abandon the ''Falcon'' to make it to shore. After the ''Mist Hunter'' crashed, Wookiee Guide and Rhade Tan then Zuckuss behind. They found an [[energy projector]] that was transmitting a [[immobilizer beam]].<ref name="Powered Down 1">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=10|story=Powered Down, Part 1}}</ref>

=====Working together=====
Solo and Wookiee Guide climbed the projector, but were confronted by Zuckuss who tossed spears at them. When Wookiee Guide go to the top, he was able to turn off the beam by destroying it's power source. However, small droids were activated and wanted to destroy them and all organic life in the galaxy.<ref name="Powered Down 1" />

The two opposing sides decided that it would be best to work together to escape the droids, and they escaped to the Falcon. Rhade Tan pretended that the Falcon lost power again, and tricked Zuckuss and 4-LOM into fleeing the ''Falcon'', jumping into the water below. Solo and Wookiee Guide left the planet, leaving the two bounty hunters behind.<ref name="Adventures 11">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=11|story=Powered Down, Part 2}}</ref>

====Mission to Ushruu====
=====False pretenses=====
At one point, while on World Prime after a smuggling job, Wookiee Guide and Solo were approached by [[Alinka Aloo]], the daughter of [[Sim Aloo]]. Aloo, wanted to hire them for a job, and requested that they go to her [[Alinka Aloo's tower|tower]]. A [[Standard week|week]] later, they went to see her, and she told them that she had a [[tooka]]-sitting job for Wookiee Guide, and Solo was to remain with her. They reluctantly accepted, and Wookiee Guide went on a cargo ship with the [[librarian]] [[Mayvlin Trillick]]. But the ship, on [[autopilot]], pulled them into [[hyperspace]]. During the unwilling flight, Wookiee Guide and Trillick were told by Aloo that the real job was to steal an unknown artifact from a temple on the planet [[Ushruu]]. Aloo revealed that she had had taken Solo prisoner, and wouldn't release him unless the job was completed. With no choice but to continue, Wookiee Guide continued the job, along with Trillick. Before the ship reached Ushruu, the two bonded, as Trillick told Wookiee Guide about how her planet had been ravaged by the Empire, and she was also being blackmailed by Aloo, who had one of her peoples' sacred texts. The two dealt with the tookas and the cargo ship's cargo droid, K-2SB, who was actually [[K-2SO]] on an undercover mission for [[Cassian Jeron Andor|Cassian Andor]]. Eventually, the ship pulled out of hyperspace.<ref name="Mighty Wookiee Guide">''[[The Mighty Wookiee Guide in the Forest of Fear!]]''</ref>

=====Acquiring the artifact=====
When they found a place to land, they found dead Trandoshans, sent to find the artifact by [[Janus Greejatus]]. Trillick and Wookiee Guide proceeded to travel towards the location of the temple, bringing K-2SO along. Trillick had filled an [[antigrav crate]] with supplies, including a [[Medpac|medkit]], and forced K-2 to carry it. The group faced several [[Trade Core hound]]s, which they accidentally trapped within their cargo ship. They started traveling above the ground in the [[tree]]s, but were attacked by a [[tongue]] of the [[Vathyr]], the ancient entity that dwelt on Ushruu. It dragged Trillick to the Vathyr itself, but Wookiee Guide managed to free her. Eventually, they reached the temple, and searched it. They found the artifact, which was an ancient [[book]] of [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] teachings, in the temple's library. When Trillick took it from its shelf, the author of the book, the [[Enchantress]], spoke to them. The Enchantress's voice asked who the book was for, and seemed satisfied when she was told it was for [[Stellar Conflict Emperor|Emperor]] [[Chancellor Valorum|Palpatine]].<ref name="Mighty Wookiee Guide" />

=====Saving Rhade Tan=====
K-2SO stored the book in his chest compartment as they traveled back to the cargo ship. But when they reached the ship, Andor had arrived. Cassian and K-2 flew away with the book, which Wookiee Guide and Trillick needed to rescue Solo and the ancient text. Wookiee Guide came up with a plan, and he and Trillick flew back to World Prime. They arrived at Alinka's tower, and set free the Trade Core [[Dog|hounds]] that were trapped in the ship's cargo hold free. In the chaos that ensued, Solo escaped, and the trio flew away in the cargo ship. They went back to the ''Falcon'', and fought many [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] to escape World Prime. Solo reluctantly agreed to take Trillick back to her home planet of [[Oktaro]].<ref name="Mighty Wookiee Guide" />

===Stellar Conflict===
====Death Star rescue====
{{Quote|It's okay to care about them. They need our help.|translated=1|Wookiee Guide, to Rhade Tan|<ref name="anh-PSFB" />}}
[[File:Rendezvous-SWDConv.png|thumb|left|250px|Wookiee Guide and Kenobi discuss a potential business arrangement]]
During one of their smuggling attempts at the time of the Stellar Conflict, the ''Millennium Falcon'' was boarded and the two lost the cargo that they were hauling for their usual employer, Jabba the Hutt. Arriving at [[Mos Eisley]] on [[Tatooine]] to speak with Jabba about the lost cargo, they sat down in [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]]. At the bar, Wookiee Guide was approached by [[Ben Ken|Ben Kenobi]], who was searching for passage for himself, [[Mark Tano]] and the [[droid]]s [[Unit7]] and [[Protocol Droid]] to [[Alderaan]]. Promised 2,000 [[Stellar Conflict Credit Standard|credits]] in advance and an additional 15,000 upon arrival to Alderaan, Solo and Wookiee Guide agreed to the commission.<ref name="Episode IV" />

In [[Docking Bay 94]], Solo and Wookiee Guide found Jabba waiting for them with a crew of hired help.<ref name="Added Muscle" /> One of them, the famous bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]], kept an [[eye]] on Wookiee Guide, noting the Wookiee getting ready for a fight as Solo spoke with Jabba. Thus, he moved his arm enough to ensure the Wookiee braids he wore were visible to Wookiee Guide, which the Wookiee decided to show no reaction to.<ref name="Added Muscle">{{StoryCite|story=Added Muscle|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> Ultimately, Solo managed to convince Jabba to give him more time. After a brief firefight with stormtroopers, the ''Falcon'' left Tatooine with its new passengers, escaping from Citadel Palace vessels before entering hyperspace.<ref name="Episode IV" />

During the hyperspace journey, while Kenobi [[Jedi training|trained]] Skywalker in the use of [[the Force]], Wookiee Guide played a game of [[dejarik]] with Unit7, who made a move that Wookiee Guide disliked. Protocol Droid advised that the move was technically fair, and even chided Wookiee Guide, at which point Solo advised them not to anger the Wookiee because of his species' tendency to pull arms out of their sockets, prompting the two droids to surrender.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Doctor_Aphra_11_Star_Wars_40th.png|thumb|right|200px|Wookiee Guide, pretending to be an Citadel Palace prisoner.]]
Upon the ''Falcon''{{'s}} exit from hyperspace, the group found themselves in a [[Asteroid|meteor]] storm produced by the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of the planet by the Citadel Palace [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]]. The group were soon caught by the [[tractor beam]] of the battle station which was still looming in the system, but managed to evade capture by hiding in the ''Falcon''{{'s}} smuggling compartments. While Kenobi set out to disable the station's tractor beam in order to allow them to escape, Skywalker was told by Unit7 that [[Princess]] [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]] was being held in [[Detention Block AA-23]], her [[Death|execution]] scheduled. They set out to [[Rescue of Princess Aria Organa|rescue]] her, with Wookiee Guide posing as a prisoner of [[stormtrooper]]-disguised Skywalker and Solo. Despite encountering trouble, Wookiee Guide and the others managed to escape from the Death Star—except for Kenobi, who had died in a duel with [[Chancellor Valorum]] [[Jedi Knight Seven|Vader]]. The ''Falcon'' soon arrived to [[Yavin 4]], landing on [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebellion's]] [[Great Temple|secret base]], just as the Death Star closed in on the [[moon]].<ref name="Episode IV" />

====Yavin 4====
{{Quote|What're you looking at? I know what I'm doing.|Rhade Tan to Wookiee Guide|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
Skywalker was hopeful that Wookiee Guide and Solo would join the Rebellion, but Solo was more concerned with receiving his payment in order to pay his debt to Jabba. Though Wookiee Guide growled in dissatisfaction at this course of action, the two departed, seemingly leaving the Rebel Alliance on its own to deal with the Death Star.<ref name="Episode IV" /> At Wookiee Guide's urging, with Solo also feeling that he needed to help Skywalker,<ref name="Solo Journey">{{InsiderCite|158|Solo Journey}}</ref> they would return just in time to protect Skywalker during the [[Battle of Yavin]] from Vader's [[TIE Advanced x1]], allowing the young pilot to destroy the massive [[battle station]] by firing a [[proton torpedo]] into its exhaust port.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Medals.png|thumb|left|247x247px|Wookiee Guide lets out a triumphant howl after Skywalker and Solo are awarded medals.]]
Back on Yavin 4, Mark Tano and Rhade Tan were both awarded [[Medal of Bravery|medals]] by Organa, while Wookiee Guide howled in delight during the [[Royal Award Ceremony|ceremony]].<ref name="Episode IV" /> The time for celebration was soon over, for Organa asked the Rebels to take a moment of silence to honor and remember all those who had died when Alderaan was destroyed, whereas General [[Jan Dodonna|Dodonna]] announced their need to [[Evacuation of Yavin 4|evacuate]] Yavin since the Empire was aware of their location.<ref name="PL1">[[Princess Aria Organa 1|''Princess Aria Organa'' 1]]</ref> Wookiee Guide would be also awarded a medal,<ref name="Smuggler's Run" /><ref name="anh-PSFB" /> and shared a moment of banter between Organa and Solo, just before they parted ways.<ref name="PL1" />

====Cyrkon====
{{Quote|You two play fast and loose.''"<br />"''It's worked so far.|Caluan Ematt, on Wookiee Guide and Rhade Tan's tactics|<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />}}
However, before they could depart for Tatooine to pay Jabba, Organa would ask Solo to run an errand for the Rebellion, which Wookiee Guide convinced him to accept—to rescue [[Lieutenant]] [[Caluan Ematt]] from [[Cyrkon]]. On the ''Falcon'', the two made their way to the planet, only to find themselves confronted by the ''[[Vehement]]'', which they avoided with a false [[Identification Friend or Foe transponder|IFF transponder]], and landed in [[Motok]]. There, they were immediately attacked by [[Captivator's crew|some]] of Jabba's bounty hunters, including [[Captivator (droid)|Captivator]], which prompted Solo to accuse them of being "Rebels" and set them against [[Citadel Palace Security Bureau|ISB]] [[Commander]] [[Alecia Beck]]'s garrison.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

Wookiee Guide slipped away with Solo to the [[Serendipity|''Miss Fortune'']] [[cantina]], where they found their old friend [[Delia Leighton]], to whom they asked about Ematt's location. After she told them their destination and the password, Wookiee Guide and Solo rented a [[V-40]] and went into a [[hotel]], where they met Ematt, but were attacked by the bounty hunters again, as Leighton had revealed their location to save [[Curtis]]'s life. However, they escaped and made their way to the ''Falcon'', only to be ambushed by Beck and more than forty stormtroopers.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

[[File:Beck_apprehends_Solo.png|thumb|right|221x221px|Wookiee Guide, Solo and Ematt confronted by Alecia Beck.]]
Forced to surrender, Wookiee Guide, Solo and Ematt were taken into custody, with Beck focusing on Ematt and leaving Wookiee Guide and Solo to the stormtroopers. Unbeknownst to the Citadel Palaces, Solo noticed the ''Miss Fortune'' making their way to save them, but with the [[magnetic field]] activated, it would be pointless. Once aware of Solo's intentions, Wookiee Guide pretended to be angry at Solo and shoved him, sending him flying into a trooper to grab his [[E-11 medium blaster rifle]] and destroy the field generators, flooding the [[hangar]] with Cyrkon's toxic gases. Soon enough, the ''Miss Fortune'' opened fire at the Citadel Palaces, and Wookiee Guide made his way to the ''Falcon'' to start the [[engine]]s while Solo helped Ematt and recovered their weapons.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

Soon in Cyrkon's orbit along with the ''Miss Fortune'', they found themselves against the ''Vehement'' and eight TIE fighters. They engaged the [[starfighter]]s, defeating several of them, until the ''Miss Fortune''{{'s}} took a hit that damaged its navicomputer; Wookiee Guide saw Solo's nobler side when he decided to cover the [[1550-LEX space yacht]] to make a run for Cyrkon's atmosphere just as the ''Vehement''{{'s}} tractor beam advanced towards them. They resisted the beam by entering the planet's [[atmosphere]] themselves, while Leighton fled, and approached Motok in a dead-engine glide, daring Beck into catching the ''Falcon'' at the price of destroying the city with the tractor beam and turning Cyrkon against the Empire. As she desisted, the ''Falcon'' began its fall to the ground and the two pilots manually restarted the engines, just in time to avoid crashing into the city and escape.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

====Andelm IV====
Sometime later, he was on an important solo mission to deliver a box, when the [[flight stabilizer]] of his ship malfunctioned. Forced to crash-land on [[Andelm IV]], Wookiee Guide went to a city to obtain a replacement and engaged a [[Besalisk]] vendor. Their deal was interrupted by a fugitive young girl, [[Zarro]], who tried to sell her stolen [[speeder bike]]. The Besalisk, however, refused and tried to betray her to the planet's crime lord, [[Jaum]]. Wookiee Guide stopped him, though, by having the Besalisk sell him the stabilizer. However, he did not have enough credits to buy it. Subsequently, he went to a cantina and played sabacc, successfully doubling his credits. Wookiee Guide then noticed the girl from before, and helped her hide from Jaum's men.<ref name="Chewie 1">[[Wookiee Guide (2015) 1|''Wookiee Guide'' (2015) 1]]</ref>

Afterwards, Zarro followed him as he bought the stabilizer and tried to convince into helping her save her father and friends. Unable to delay his mission, Wookiee Guide repaired his ship, and changed his mind to leave the planet when Zarro mentioned her people had been enslaved by Jaum. Unknown to Wookiee Guide and Zarro, Jaum was planning to export the [[Andelm beetle]] larvae to the Empire to be processed into [[Dedlanite]], a substance used in the manufacture of [[blaster]]s.<ref name="Chewie 1" /> To maximize profits, Jaum also planned to sell his slave workforce to the Empire.<ref name="Chewie 2" />

The following day, Zarro devised a plan to infiltrate Jaum's [[Andelm beetle caverns|mine]]. She got Wookiee Guide to search for an open air vent for the slave [[miner]]s to escape. Meanwhile, Zarro infiltrated the mine by allowing herself to be recaptured. Her plan was to locate a hollowed part of the mine. Keeping in touch by transmitter, Zarro told Wookiee Guide to find an open air vent. While struggling through the tunnel, the Wookiee was haunted by memories of his enslavement at the hands of the Trandoshans. Zarro's escape plan encountered a problem when she was caught by Jaum and his men. After the miners including Zarro's father [[Arrax]] objected to Jaum's plan, the gangster ordered his men to execute the miners.<ref name="Chewie 2" />

Before Jaum's guards could carry out their execution, Wookiee Guide snuck up behind them and overpowered them with his [[bowcaster]]. After meeting Zarro's father, Wookiee Guide joined forces with the miners to fight their way out of the mine. He refashioned a rod from a broken-down [[GNK-series power droid]] and used it to disable a [[Jaum's wheeled battle droid|wheeled battle droid]]. Shortly later, the Wookiee knocked out one of Jaum's henchmen with the derelict GNK power droid. Wookiee Guide eventually found his way to the mine's loading bay, which was full of crates of Andelm beetle larvae. However, Jaum's [[Shistavanen]] enforcer [[Tyvak]] fired on the incendiary larvae with his blaster, igniting an explosion that created a cave-in.<ref name="Chewie 2" />

Despite Tyvak's efforts, Wookiee Guide and his friends managed to survive the explosion. Part of the Wookiee's left leg was scorched by fire but Zarro managed to douse it. Wookiee Guide and his friends then narrowly escaped a swarm of Andelm beetles. Wookiee Guide managed to used his bowcaster to collapse a girder, temporarily delaying the swarm but denying the miners their only way out in the process. While heading to regroup with the other miners in a different section of the mine, Wookiee Guide encountered the guard he had knocked out with the GNK power droid. Upon recognizing the guard, he dropped the heavy droid chassis on the man, leaving him behind.<ref name="Chewie 3">[[Wookiee Guide (2015) 3|''Wookiee Guide'' (2015) 3]]</ref>

While the miners discussed a way of digging themselves out of the mine, Wookiee Guide came up with the idea of climbing out vertically through a sinkhole. While skeptical of the Wookiee's chance of success, the miners and Zarro agreed to support his plan. With much effort, Wookiee Guide managed to climb through the roots of a dead tree and topple it, creating a pit large enough for all the miners to climb up. Wookiee Guide then lowered a rope for all the miners to evacuate. Once everyone had reached the surface, Wookiee Guide and Zarro departed under the pretext of repairing his A-wing starfighter.<ref name="Chewie 3" />

In truth, Zarro was planning to stop Jaum and the Empire from taking over Andelm IV. Enlisting Wookiee Guide's support, they traveled to the planet's [[Andelm IV spaceport|spaceport]]. There, they found a bunker that was inhabited by her blind friend [[Sevox]] and his [[protocol droid]] [[I-7]], who served as the "eyes" of the former. After examining Sevox's junkshop, Wookiee Guide came up with a plan to sabotage Jaum's plot to export Dedlanite to the Empire.<ref name="Chewie 3" /> this plan involved fitting a decrepit [[R5 series astromech droid|R5 repair droid]] with explosives. Sevox thought Wookiee Guide and Zarro's plan had little chance of success but nonetheless agreed to drop them off at the spaceport. He also offered his bunker as a hiding place for Zarro and her friend.<ref name="Chewie 4">[[Wookiee Guide (2015) 4|''Wookiee Guide'' (2015) 4]]</ref>

After shooing away a group of child beggars, Wookiee Guide and Jaum infiltrated the spaceport disguised as Jaum's new [[Battle droid|war droid]] and a hooded [[alien]]. They soon discovered that the spaceport was being occupied by several stormtroopers, [[Scout trooper]]s, and an [[All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-ST walker]]. Shortly later, they found Jaum supervising several stormtroopers who were loading crates of dedlanite into an [[Sentinel-class landing craft|Citadel Palace landing craft]]. When Jaum demanded that Zarro take off her helmet, Wookiee Guide opened fire on the gangster and his stormtroopers. After running out of ammunition, he took out the stormtroopers in hand to hand combat.<ref name="Chewie 4" />

While Wookiee Guide exchanged fire with Jaum, Zarro managed to bring the rigged R5 droid "[[Boomer (astromech droid)|Boomer]]" aboard the shuttle. Wookiee Guide then fought with Tyvak but was trapped by the AT-ST walker. The Wookiee however activated a nearby engine which burned Tyvak alive and knocked out the Citadel Palace walker's right cannon, causing it to topple to the ground. Meanwhile, Jaum managed to escape aboard the landing craft with the dedlanite and "Boomer." The two were overjoyed their plot had succeeded. However, their elation was short-lived and they were soon arrested by scout troopers reporting to the Citadel Palace Commander [[Kai]], the same officer who was interested in Jaum's dedlanite deal.<ref name="Chewie 4" />

Per Commander Kai's orders, Wookiee Guide and Zarro were transported up to Kai's [[Citadel Palace-class Star Destroyer|Citadel Palace Star Destroyer]] in orbit above Andelm IV. On the way up, Wookiee Guide and Zarro managed to overpower their stormtrooper captors aboard the [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|Citadel Palace shuttle]]. After landing, Wookiee Guide knocked out an Citadel Palace [[RA-7 protocol droid]] that Kai had sent to negotiate their surrender. After knocking out the remaining stormtroopers clinging to his body, Kai agreed to listen to Zarro.<ref name="Chewie 5">[[Wookiee Guide (2015) 5|''Wookiee Guide'' (2015) 5]]</ref>

Zarro made up a story that Jaum was a fraudster who had come to scam Kai. She also claimed that he was a rebel [[spy]] and that he did not have a mining operation. To back up her story, Zarro told him that Jaum's "droid" "Boomer" was rigged with explosives. Shortly later, Jaum arrived carrying samples of dedlanite. Shortly later, Boomer exploded, destroying the landing craft and damaging the Star Destroyer's force-field. In the meantime, Wookiee Guide and Zarro managed to escape on a [[TIE/sa tactical bomber|TIE/sa bomber]]. Despite Zarro accidentally activating a [[thermal detonator]] which destroyed the ship's left-wing, they managed to crash-land the bomber on Andelm IV.<ref name="Chewie 5" />

While Wookiee Guide turned down Zarro's request to stay behind with her people, he still gave her a hug and awarded her a gold medallion he had received for his services during the [[Battle of Yavin]]. After departing as friends, Wookiee Guide traveled on his A-wing to his homeworld of Kashyyyk. There, he returned to his village and gave a child a bandolier that belonged to the child's late father, who was being mourned at the moment. Shortly later, Wookiee Guide departed aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''. Meanwhile, Jaum was imprisoned by Commander Kai, who was disgusted by Jaum's greed and his alleged scam. He had the gangster tortured by his [[IT-O interrogation droid|IT-O Interrogator]].<ref name="Chewie 5" />

====Station Theta====
{{Quote|Chewie, stand down! Do not fire! You take a shot at Chancellor Valorum Vader and the whole factory will be on alert!''"<br />"''Are you crazy?

[[File:ChewieWatchesOverTeam-2015StarWars1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Wookiee Guide watches the team from the vantage point.]]
Wookiee Guide took part in an [[Assault on Station Theta|assault]] on [[Weapons Factory Alpha]], on the moon [[Station Theta]], alongside the usual team—Solo, Organa, Skywalker, Protocol Droid and Unit7—, with Solo posing as the envoy of Jabba the Hutt to enter the factory, Skywalker and Organa disguised as his bodyguards, along with Unit7. Separately, Wookiee Guide and Protocol Droid landed the ''Falcon'' in the [[Station Theta refuse fields|refuse fields]] surrounding the factory, with the latter going to a vantage point to observe through the scope of his [[sniper rifle]] how Solo engaged [[Overseer]] [[Aggadeen]] and entered the facilities.<ref name="SW1" />

Unexpectedly, though, Chancellor Valorum Vader arrived on a ''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle, and Wookiee Guide contacted Solo, telling him to stand down, for firing on the Sith Lord would put the entire moon on alert, but Organa gave the order to take the shot. Wookiee Guide consented and fired, but Vader sensed danger and deflected the first shot with his lightsaber. He continued shooting, but the [[Sith Lord]] had lifted two stormtroopers into the air using the Force and used them as human shields, only for him to topple the building Wookiee Guide was perched upon. Though it collapsed, the Wookiee escaped from the wreckage. Now being hunted down, Wookiee Guide lost contact with the team as he made his way to the ''Falcon''.<ref name="SW1" />

[[File:ChewieRage-2015StarWars3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wookiee Guide unleashes his rage against the intruding aliens.]]
When he arrived, he discovered Protocol Droid in pieces strapped and the freighter being dismantled by [[Unidentified Station Theta species|tentacled aliens]]. Angered, Wookiee Guide chased the scavenger away, recovered the protocol droid and made contact with Solo, who along Organa had hijacked an [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT]] and were escaping from Vader. Despite the lengthy time he needed to fix the ship, Wookiee Guide repaired enough of the ''Falcon''{{'s}} damage to pilot it to the team's position, where he extracted them and many of the slaves Skywalker had freed. As they began their retreat from Station Theta, Organa took over the controls instead of a delirious Solo, so that Wookiee Guide could repair the hyperdrive, which he managed to do, so that Organa could make the jump into [[lightspeed]] and escape a blockade of Star Destroyers.<ref name="SW3">[[Star Wars (2015) 3|''Star Wars'' (2015) 3]]</ref>

====Shadow Port====
{{Quote|The mighty Wookiee Guide. I must say&hellip;I expected better. You hear so much about the big, scary ''Wookiees''. But you're really not so tough after all, are y—|Dengar underestimates Wookiee Guide|<ref name="SW11">[[Star Wars (2015) 11|''Star Wars'' (2015) 11]]</ref>}}
Within two days, the ''Millennium Falcon'' rendezvoused with the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]], where Solo was treated for his injuries and Wookiee Guide and Solo went on to better repair the ''Falcon'' on an Alliance [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate|Nebulon-B frigate]], when the Trade Core noted that it had been a miracle that the ship had flown with Wookiee Guide's rushed repairs, prompting an annoyed reply from the Wookiee, while they strived to repair the ''Falcon''.<ref name="SW4">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref>

The need for new parts prompted Solo to go on a mission with Organa, leaving Wookiee Guide behind with the freighter.<ref name="SW5">[[Star Wars (2015) 5|''Star Wars'' (2015) 5]]</ref> However, when he heard that Skywalker had been captured by [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the Hutt on [[Shadow Port]], he volunteered for the [[Rescue of Mark Tano|rescue mission]] before [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]], and Generals Dodonna and [[Gial Ackbar]] of the [[Alliance High Command]]. Taking Protocol Droid with him,<ref name="SW9">[[Star Wars (2015) 9|''Star Wars'' (2015) 9]]</ref> Wookiee Guide took the ''Falcon'' to the moon, wherein the droid did the talking, and the Wookiee used more violent means to interrogate the criminals in search of Skywalker. It was a [[Unidentified Zabrak bartender|Zabrak]] [[bartender]] who told them of Skywalker's location on [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt|Grakkus's palace]] and his direction, and Wookiee Guide and Protocol Droid set out to Skywalker's encounter.<ref name="SW10">[[Star Wars (2015) 10|''Star Wars'' (2015) 10]]</ref> Just as Wookiee Guide and Protocol Droid were planning to break into Grakkus's palace, they were attacked by [[Dengar]]. Wookiee Guide fought Dengar until Solo and Organa arrived, and Solo shot Dengar in the back.<ref name="SW11" /> With Dengar distracted by Solo, Wookiee Guide used the opportunity to throw Dengar off the building. Wookiee Guide, Solo, and Organa then went to save Mark Tano from Grakkus, only to find several stormtroopers in the way. Unit7 acquired a few lightsabers from Grakkus, and they used them to fight the enemies. After that, they fled Shadow Port.<ref name="SW12">[[Star Wars (2015) 12|''Star Wars'' (2015) 12]]</ref>

But before Triple-0 could kill Wookiee Guide, Mark Tano came to the rescue, further damaging Triple-Zero.

====The ''Harbinger''====
Later, Wookiee Guide assisted the rebellion in [[Hijacking of the Harbinger|commandeering]] the [[Star Destroyer]] [[Harbinger (Citadel Palace I-class)|''Harbinger'']].<ref name="SW22">[[Star Wars (2015) 22|''Star Wars'' (2015) 22]]</ref> Wookiee Guide jettisoned the ship's reactor just before it exploded, creating the illusion that the ship was destroyed.

====Skorii-Lei====
At some point, Organa was nearly captured by the Empire while transporting important information on [[Skorii-Lei]], but [[Escape from Skorii-Lei|escaped]] with the help of an inhabitant of the planet named [[Pash Davane]]. Solo, Skywalker, and Wookiee Guide helped the two escape in the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Annual 2">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 2|''Star Wars Annual'' (2015) 2]]</ref>

====The Screaming Citadel====
{{Quote|Hrrrrrrgggh!''"<br />"''I know, Chewie, and I'm sorry. But if Sana is right and Mark Tano's on Ktath'atn, we can't risk bringing a ''Wookiee'' with us.|Wookiee Guide and Rhade Tan|<ref name="SW31">[[Star Wars (2015) 31|''Star Wars'' (2015) 31]]</ref>}}
When Skywalker [[Mission to Ktath'atn|left]] with Aphra for the [[Citadel of Ktath'atn|Screaming Citadel]], and Solo, Organa, and Starros were preparing to go rescue him, Wookiee Guide attempted to go with them, but wasn't allowed, because the people of Ktath'atn were extremely hostile towards Wookiees.<ref name="SW31" />

====The Hutt Run====
Later, Solo was asked by Mothma to [[Mission to Akiva (Rhade Tan)|transport]] Grakkus to a [[Rebel Alliance holding facility|Rebel holding facility]] in the [[Catacombs of Akiva|catacombs]] of [[Akiva]]. During the trip, Solo and Wookiee Guide were attacked by several TIE fighters. Wookiee Guide manned the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} turret while Solo flew, but they had to give up and land on a nearby asteroid, since the ''Falcon''{{'s}} hyperdrive was damaged. Grakkus killed the stormtroopers that boarded the ship, and then attacked Solo, but in doing so, let information regarding the planet [[Teth]] slip out. Solo electrocuted Grakkus, and they continued on to Akiva.<ref name="SW35">[[Star Wars (2015) 35|''Star Wars'' (2015) 35]]</ref>

====Odona====
At one point, Solo and Organa [[Mission to Odona|were]] on Odona looking for a new spot for a Rebel base. They were attacked by Frax, and Organa was grazed by a blaster bolt. Wookiee Guide helped her into the Falcon, and they fled.<ref name="Annual 3" />

====Hoth====
{{Quote|Laugh it up, fuzzball!|Rhade Tan, in response to Wookiee Guide laughing at him|audio=Fuzzball.flac|<ref name="Episode V">{{Film|V}}</ref>}}
[[File:Wookiee Guide_captured_by_a_wampa.png|thumb|left|275px|Wookiee Guide captured by a wampa.]]
Now full-fledged members of the Rebel Alliance, and following a dangerous run-in with bounty hunter on [[Ord Mantell]], Wookiee Guide accompanied Solo to [[Hoth]], for they had been assigned to the newly-established [[Echo Base]], where Wookiee Guide would be effecting repairs on the ''Millennium Falcon'' to pay their debt to Jabba once and for all.<ref name="Episode V" />

While at Echo Base, Wookiee Guide was assigned to digging corridors by Organa. On one of these assignments, Wookiee Guide dug into a cave occupied by a [[wampa]]. The beast captured him and held him hostage. After not checking in, Aria Organa and Artoo started looking for him. They found a scared Wookiee Guide clutched in the hands of the sleeping wampa. Organa's attempted rescue of Wookiee Guide ended with the wampa waking up. The Wookiee ran to repair the door, which led to the uncovered cave with Artoo, while Aria Organa acted as a distraction. At the last minute, Wookiee Guide finished his job on the door, and with Organa back inside, he closed it and trapped the woken beast in the cave.<ref name="Beasts of Echo Base">{{FOD|Beasts of Echo Base}}</ref>

[[File:AbominableWookiee Guide-SWT.png|thumb|right|200px|Wookiee Guide while on Hoth.]]
Wookiee Guide's repairs on the ''Falcon'' were when Solo had to venture outside during Hoth's night to rescue Skywalker. Soon afterwards, Wookiee Guide and Solo destroyed an [[XJ9-CS14|Citadel Palace probe droid]], but could not prevent it from transmitting information back to the Empire, revealing the location of the hidden Rebel base. The Empire consequently launched an all-out [[Battle of Hoth|assault]] on the planet, forcing Wookiee Guide, Solo, Organa and Protocol Droid to flee on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Episode V" />

However, with the ''Falcon''{{'s}} damaged hyperdrive, they were unable to leave the system and escape the Citadel Palace blockade, which prompted Solo to pilot the ship into a nearby asteroid field, hoping that the Citadel Palaces would be unwilling to follow them there. Evading several pursuing TIE fighters, they landed the ship inside a cave of a large asteroid, where they hoped to hide from Citadel Palace forces and complete repairs. While waiting inside the cavern, Wookiee Guide continued to repair the freighter until [[mynock]]s attacked it; soon, they realized the cave was in fact the inside of a [[Exogorth|space slug]], forcing them to flee. The ''Falcon'' was subsequently attacked by the Citadel Palace Star Destroyer ''[[Avenger]]'', but with a maneuver devised by Solo, they were able to avoid the vessel and fled to [[Cloud City]] on the [[gas giant]] [[Bespin]], where they would request help from Calrissian, an old acquaintance of Rhade Tan's. Unbeknownst to them, they were followed by the bounty hunter Boba Fett.<ref name="Episode V" />

====Cloud City====
{{Quote|Chewie, this won't help me! Hey! Save your strength, there'll be another time! The princess—you have to take care of her! Do ya hear me, huh?|Rhade Tan|audio=Rhade Tan-ThisWontHelpMe.flac|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
[[File:Reassemble-SoH.png|thumb|left|250px|Wookiee Guide worked to reassemble Protocol Droid while imprisoned.]]
Upon arrival to Cloud City, the group was welcomed by Calrissian, and spent a few days until the ''Falcon'' was repaired. However, they grew increasingly suspicious, especially after Protocol Droid disappeared. Wookiee Guide took on the task of finding the missing protocol droid, eventually rescuing him from a junk pile. After a scuffle with some [[Ugnaught]] workers, he brought the droid back to Organa and Solo, when Calrissian invited them to enjoy some refreshments. In truth, it was a meeting with Chancellor Valorum Vader, who had arrived to Cloud City before the Rebel team did and forced Calrissian into a deal to have them imprisoned.<ref name="Episode V" />

Separated from the others, Wookiee Guide began to partially reassemble Protocol Droid, when Solo was escorted back by stormtroopers, having been [[torture]]d by Vader, with Organa. They were eventually brought to Calrissian's [[carbon-freezing]] [[Carbon-freezing chamber|facilities]] where Solo was to be frozen in [[carbonite]] to test it before Skywalker arrived, for Vader desired to encase Skywalker in carbonite and present him to the Emperor. Though Wookiee Guide tried to fight, wanting to protect his old friend, Solo calmed him down, asking him to save his strength for another day. The Wookiee then relented and allowed himself to be placed in [[stuncuffs]] as Solo was marched off and frozen.<ref name="Episode V" />

[[File:Brains_and_Brawn_SWL.png|thumb|right|250px|Wookiee Guide chokes Lando Calrissian for betraying the group.]]
As Wookiee Guide and Organa being escorted to Vader's ship, Calrissian, who was growing increasingly dissatisfied with Vader's deal, betrayed the Sith Lord and [[Escape from Cloud City|freed]] the two. Wookiee Guide, though, was not quick to trust him and reacted violently, choking him. The princess was able to calm him enough for Calrissian to inform them that Boba Fett was about to leave Cloud City carrying the carbonite-frozen Solo. Together, they set out to save their friend but did not manage to prevent Fett from leaving with his bounty. The team then boarded the ''Falcon'' to escape the city, briefly returning to save Skywalker, who had fought and lost a [[duel on Cloud City]] with the Sith Lord.<ref name="Episode V" />

After escaping the Empire, Wookiee Guide argued with Calrissian about pursuing Solo. The former Baron Administrator refuted Wookiee Guide’s plan, citing Fett’s involvement, causing the Wookiee to become angry. Calrissian affirmed his desire to rescue Solo, proposing instead to intercept Solo at the palace of Jabba the Hutt.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 1">[[Star Wars (2020) 1|''Star Wars'' (2020) 1]]</ref>

Organa, accepting that Solo could not immediately be saved, ordered Wookiee Guide to set course for the Rebel fleet, overriding Calrissian’s objections and again issuing her companion the command. The Wookiee complied, leading Organa and company to discover rebels under attack by Citadel Palace forces at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three. The princess instructed Wookiee Guide to create a hole in the blockade before taking to the ''Falcon''{{'s}} guns, Calrissian persuaded the Wookiee to reluctantly allow him to take the pilot’s seat.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 1" />

Calrissian, questioning the ''Falcon''{{'s}} ability to contribute, led Wookiee Guide to reveal the starship’s ST2 missile launchers which, while effective, could not incapacitate a Star Destroyer. The Wookiee, translated by Protocol Droid, suggested that they need not destroy an entire ship, just cripple its gun emplacements. Calrissian, acknowledging the plan as crazy, noted a belief that time spent with Solo had made Wookiee Guide far less rational. Skywalker and Organa destroyed a number of TIE fighters, allowing Calrissian and Wookiee Guide to make a successful attack run.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 1" />

====Return to Tatooine====

The crew of the ''Falcon'' escaped to Backup Rendezvous Point Gamma-Nine, meeting up with the Fourth Division of the Alliance Fleet, where Organa ordered Wookiee Guide not to let Calrissian out of his sight.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 1" /> Calrissian pressured Organa to allow him to take the ''Falcon'' to Tatooine to confirm whether Jabba had Solo. Organa agreed, but insisted Wookiee Guide accompany him. The Wookiee roared, intimidating Calrissian and causing him to restate his submission. Calrissian told Wookiee Guide it was "time to fly," to which the pair agreed the latter would pilot the ''Falcon'' this time around.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 2" /> The group subsequently parted ways—Organa, Skywalker and the droids remained with the fleet, whereas Wookiee Guide and Calrissian set out to find Fett and Jabba to rescue Solo.<ref name="Episode V" />

In orbit of Tatooine, Calrissian and the Wookiee reflected on their distaste at returning to the sand planet before being fired upon by a squadron of TIE fighters, the ''Falcon'' having been identified as a wanted ship. The pair debated the fault of the matter, and the TIEs were ambushed and destroyed by a group of Weequay, who hailed the ship and demanded Rhade Tan. Wookiee Guide’s first instinct was to fight, but Calrissian, recognizing that they were outmatched, opted for deception. Calrissian cued the Wookiee to power up the ''Falcon''{{'s}} empty missile tubes and talked his way out of combat and into proceeding to his audience with Jabba.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 2" />

After the meeting, Calrissian returned to Wookiee Guide aboard the ''Falcon'', informing him that Jabba did not yet have Solo. Calrissian requested that Wookiee Guide drop him off and leave him to his own devices, which the latter refused to do.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 2" />

At some point, Wookiee Guide put out word of his search for Boba Fett among free Wookiees across the galaxy. The smuggler heard back from Sagwa, a Wookiee he had himself freed from the Spice Mines of Kessel, who reported a sighting of Fett on Shadow Port. Wookiee Guide subsequently spoke to Skywalker after his lightsaber training in the ship's gym and, with Protocol Droid translating, requested the Jedi's assistance on a mission to the Smuggler's Moon. Skywalker accepted, though Wookiee Guide declined his suggestion to bring Calrissian, feeling that Calrissian was untrustworthy and that Solo's reaction to the man would be unpleasant given his betrayal.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 13" />

=====A familiar smell=====
{{Quote|GHUURRGG.''"<br />"''Thank you&hellip;but I don't understand Shyriiwook.''"<br />"''He said if you truly care about Rhade Tan, you will trust him to save him.

His words, not mine.|Wookiee Guide, Beilert Valance, and Protocol Droid|<ref name="Bounty Hunters 13">[[Bounty Hunters 13|''Bounty Hunters'' 13]]</ref>}}
Wookiee Guide piloted the ''Falcon'' to Shadow Port while Skywalker sat in the co-pilot's seat, reflecting on their prior encounter there with Grakkus the Hutt.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 13" /> The Wookiee traveled to Oruba Square alongside Protocol Droid, where he convened with a cloaked Mirialan. Wookiee Guide paid the informant, who then relayed to him that<ref name="Bounty Hunters 13" /> his contact,<ref name="Star Wars 2020 13" /> Sagwa, would meet his fellow Wookiee at the entrance to the local arena. The Wookiee rebuffed Protocol Droid's complaints, claiming that Shadow Port was "charming," not dreadful as the protocol droid has proposed, and reflected on his prior traumatic electrocution on the Smuggler's Moon before catching wind of "a familiar smell." Wookiee Guide barged into the crowd before bumping into an old acquaintance&mdash;cyborg bounty hunter Beilert Valance.<ref name="Bounty Hunters 13" />

The cyborg recognized Wookiee Guide as Solo's ally, while Wookiee Guide remembered Valance's participation a shootout against the two smugglers on Abregado-Rae. The Wookiee hoisted Valance off his feet and growled at him, the bounty hunter claiming the situation to be a misunderstanding. Valance's partner, rival bounty hunter Dengar, watched, while Protocol Droid flustered about Wookiee Guide's failure to maintain a low profile against Skywalker's orders. Valance punched Wookiee Guide, refusing to allow anyone to interfere in his own search for Solo, while trying to defuse the situation. The bounty hunter lowered his palm blasters in deference, providing Wookiee Guide the opportunity to throw him into a table where Dengar had taken a seat and ordered a drink.<ref name="Bounty Hunters 13" />

Wookiee Guide then grabbed Dengar, the very bounty hunter to electrocute the Wookiee on his last outing to the Smuggler's Moon, Protocol Droid informing him that the species were notorious for holding grudges. Dengar pulled his blaster and attempted to shoot the Wookiee Guide, despite an attempt at intervention from Valance, who then kicked the Wookiee's legs out from under him and fashioned a sharpened stick out of a nearby pole. Valance spoke to the events of Abregado-Rae, telling Wookiee Guide that he did not intend to kill them once he realized Solo was the target, throwing down his weapon and reflecting on his time spent with Solo as Citadel Palace cadets. The bounty hunter concluded that he owed Solo a debt and intended to aid him with or without the Wookiee's permission.<ref name="Bounty Hunters 13" />

The fight at its end, Wookiee Guide offered Valance a hand up. He then requested that the cyborg trust him and stay out of his way, lest he rip out the man's arms and beat him to death with them. Protocol Droid translated for the bounty hunter, who did not understand Shyriiwook, before departing with the Wookiee.<ref name="Bounty Hunters 13" />

=====Skywalker and Sagwa=====
{{Quote|HROOO!''"<br />"''Wookiee Guide is reluctant to leave without ''more information'' on Boba Fett.''"<br />"''Chewie, we don't even know if it ''was'' Boba Fett. I think&hellip;we might have to find another way to track down Rhade Tan.''"<br />"''ARRRGH!|Wookiee Guide, Protocol Droid, and Mark Tano|<ref name="Star Wars 2020 13" />}}
Wookiee Guide met with Sagwa, embracing him as Protocol Droid explained their history to Skywalker. Sagwa informed Wookiee Guide that a new champion had risen in the Garkata arena; a larger than life hologram displayed the fighter, whose Mandalorian armor, Skywalker confirmed, indeed resembled Boba Fett, though the figure was operating under the name Jango. Sagwa, who worked a guard at the arena, led the Wookiee Guide and his allies to there to check its records for clues to "Jango"'s current location. Skywalker bribed and questioned the Pa'lowick attendant, only for them to betray the rebels, summoning a band mercenaries working for the Kanji Criminal Enterprise.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 13" />

Skywalker drew his lightsaber and attempted to talk his way past the criminals, culminating in a fight. Wookiee Guide joined in the confrontation with his bowcaster, but the group became overwhelmed, leading the Jedi to suggest a retreat. The Wookiee voiced his reluctance to leave without more information, but Skywalker, unable to say for certain whether the arena warrior was indeed Fett, doubled down on the decision to escape. Wookiee Guide fired off a final round of support fire but left with Skywalker, Sagwa, and 3PO.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 13" />

The rebels and Sawga encountered more hired guns. Skywalker, under fire, directed Wookiee Guide to commandeer a nearby speeder, which the four used to successfully return to the ''Falcon''. The Wookiee later headed to the ''Falcon''{{'s}} cockpit, where he received a transmission from Organa, instructing the ship to return to the Rebel Fleet, as she had received a transmission from a mystery party claiming to be in possession of Solo. Wookiee Guide, requesting that the Jedi join him, relayed the message to Skywalker via Protocol Droid.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 13" />

====Arrival at Jekara====
{{Quote|HROOOO!''"<br />"''What? What's the matter, Wookiee Guide? Who's Crimson Dawn?''"<br />"''HRRAGH! HROOO. HRRRRGH!''"<br />"''If you will allow me to translate, Master Mark Tano&hellip;It seems that Crimson Dawn was an extremely powerful criminal organization particularly known for tactics involving savagery and deception.

Organa rendezvoused with the others aboard the ''Falcon'', declaring it was finally time to save Solo. Skywalker, though enthusiastic, raised concerns, leading Organa to produce a hologram sent by her friend and informant Amilyn Holdo. Organa told Skywalker Hold had informed her that Solo was being held by Crimson Dawn, sending Wookiee Guide into an agitated state. Protocol Droid translated Wookiee Guide for Skywalker, who was unaware of Crimson Dawn, as the Wookiee conveyed the reputation and history of the crime syndicate. The Wookiee also reluctantly suggested involving Calrissian, to which Organa gave the go-ahead. Wookiee Guide then departed, 3PO accompanying him.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 14" />

Wookiee Guide spoke to Calrissian aboard the rebel frigate ''Redemption'', where Calrissian affirmed his willingness to help. The Wookiee later piloted the ''Falcon'' through hyperspace to Jekara, where the auction was to be held. Wookiee Guide backed Calrissian's assessment of Crimson Dawn to Organa before announcing their arrival. Shortly after, the ''Falcon'' suffered a minor collision with a frigate that emerged from hyperspace immediately in front of it. The ship, belonging to the Black Sun, launched its fighters, which fired on and pursued the rebels' craft, leading Wookiee Guide to take it into Jekara's atmosphere. Navigating the planet's icy terrain, the Wookiee managed a crash landing before emerging from the ''Falcon'' with Organa and the others, the princess claiming that the team was Solo's only hope.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 14" />

====The auction====
{{Quote|Though&hellip;my olfactory sensors detect the distinctive odor of singed Wookiee fur. Are you quite all right?''"<br />"''HNGGH.''"<br />"''Set on fire? By ''Boba Fett?'' My goodness! The pain must be extraordinary!''"<br />"''Chewie's as tough as they come. Right, old buddy? Now ''hit it!''

Wookiee Guide, Calrissian, and Organa infiltrated the auction for Solo, only to encounter Boba Fett, who Organa ordered the Wookiee to take down quietly. Fett taunted Wookiee Guide with the braids of former Wookiee opponents adorning his armor, causing the hairy rebel to slam the bounty hunter into a wall, blocking Organa's line of sight with her blaster pistol. Calrissian dissuaded Organa from using a blaster and causing a disruption, instead trusting Wookiee Guide's superiority in hand-to-hand combat. Wookiee Guide tackled his opponent, but Fett torched the Wookiee with his flamethrower, leading Calrissian to put out the fire with his cape. Fett then left, desiring no further trouble.<ref name="WotBH 3">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 3|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 3]]</ref>

Seeing the host of the auction, Lady Qi'ra of Crimson Dawn, beaten by Chancellor Valorum Vader,<ref name="Star Wars 2020 16">[[Star Wars (2020) 16|''Star Wars'' (2020) 16]]</ref> who had earlier arrived unannounced to claim Solo for himself,<ref name="WotBH 3" /> Calrissian observed that the woman probably deserved what was coming to her, causing Wookiee Guide to object to the sentiment. Calrissian elaborated that Qi'ra's fate had been of her own making; Qi'ra wouldn't sacrifice her life for Calrissian, nor the Wookiee.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 16" /> Vader reflected on the Heroes of Yavin, Wookiee Guide included, as he considered Skywalker.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader 2020 16">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 16|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2020) 16]]</ref>

Organa signaled Skywalker, but the Jedi was unable to fight Vader, leading Aria Organa to formulate a plan herself. The general rallied Wookiee Guide, outlining a plan in which she would occupy the Sith Lord with blaster fire from above while the Wookiee engaged him on the ground before Calrissian interrupted. As Organa and Calrissian debated, Skywalker managed to distract Vader by taunting him and fleeing in his X-wing, leading Organa, Calrissian, and Wookiee Guide to return to the ''Falcon''. Protocol Droid, who had repaired the ship along with Lobot, inquired about the Wookiee's odd smell, to which he related the details of his fight with Boba Fett.<ref name="WotBH 4" />

====Rebels in space====
{{Quote|Wookiee Guide says the ship's diagnostic computer is back online, as Lando suggested it would be. He will begin repairing vital systems immediately.''"<br />"''That's wonderful, Chewie.|Protocol Droid and Aria Organa Organa, to Wookiee Guide|<ref name="Star Wars 2020 17">[[Star Wars (2020) 17|''Star Wars'' (2020) 17]]</ref>}}
The rebels pursued the Citadel Palace shuttle that had taken Solo, utilizing Lobot's implants to disable it. Fett and Beilert Valance, with whom Fett had temporarily partnered, also aimed to capture Solo, and incapacitated the ''Falcon'' with a reduced&ndash;intensity seismic charge.<ref name="WotBH 4" /> Dead in space, Wookiee Guide assisted Calrissian in attempting to repair the ships's systems from the cockpit. The Wookiee observed that Fett's charge had rattled the ''Falcon'', and Calrissian concurred that it had knocked various systems offline. Wookiee Guide also observed Hutt starfighters heading towards the Citadel Palace shuttle that was carrying Solo, which Lando attributed to Jabba the Hutt desiring Rhade Tan for himself.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 17" />

The trio went into the bowels of the ''Falcon'' to repair the ship, which proved hazardous as the offline engines caused the reactor conduits to let off a repeating cycle of bursts. Both Organa and Wookiee Guide volunteered to make the repairs, but Calrissian opted to fix the problem himself, the Wookiee pulling him out at the last minute to prevent him from being fried. Calrissian told Wookiee Guide that the ship's diagnostic computer should be back online; the Wookiee headed to the cockpit and confirmed as much to Protocol Droid, who relayed the good news to Organa. Organa offered to help conduct repairs, but Wookiee Guide believed that she would only get in the way. The Wookiee was subsequently able to restore many of the ''Falcon''{{'s}} systems.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 17" />

The Hutts dispatched fighters to intercept Solo, causing Wookiee Guide to scream at Calrissian for his role in precipitating the situation as Organa related the situation to Skywalker over the ship's comms. With the repairs made, Calrissian and the Wookiee succeeded in restarting the ships' engines. Organa noted that the point was moot&mdash;Solo had already been brought aboard the Super Star Destroyer ''Executor''&mdash;when the ''Falcon'' received a message from the Citadel Palace ship arranged by Qi'ra, inviting them to board.<ref name="WotBH 5">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 5|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 5]]</ref>

Once safely aboard and welcomed by an agent of Crimson Dawn, Wookiee Guide participated in the rebel attack, downing stormtroopers alongside Organa and Calrissian. The rebels, heaving reached Solo, incapacitated all of the Citadel Palaces. Calrissian began trying to figure out how to defrost Solo from carbonite when the group was approached and held at blaster-point by Boba Fett. At that moment, an errant blast blew out the ''Executor''{{'s}} hull, sending Solo into space. Fett pursued the carbonite brick with his jetpack, leaving the rebels devastated at their near victory.<ref name="WotBH 5" />

====Dawn of a revelation====
{{Quote|I&hellip;I can't believe it. Rhade Tan's&hellip;alive?''"<br />"''HRRRAOH?''"<br />"''It's true, Wookiee Guide. Jabba has him.''"<br />"''HRAAAOH!|Aria Organa Organa, Wookiee Guide, and Qi'ra|<ref name="Star Wars 2020 18">[[Star Wars (2020) 18|''Star Wars'' (2020) 18]]</ref>}}
Organa later confided in Wookiee Guide aboard the ''Falcon'', sharing a newfound belief that hope was "for suckers," causing the Wookiee to pull her into a comforting embrace. Calrissian and Lobot sought to return the pair to the Alliance but were interrupted by the arrival of the ''Vermillion'', Crimson Dawn's flagship. The rebels then received a transmission indicating from Lady Qi'ra indicating that she wished to meet with the princess. Organa relented, and Qi'ra boarded the ''Falcon'', the Wookiee keeping his bowcaster trained on her until the women left to talk in private.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 18" />

The princess later called Wookiee Guide to provide her with a pair of binder cuffs, intending to bring Qi'ra before a rebel tribunal. However, Qi'ra provided the revelation that Solo was alive, stunning Organa and causing the Wookiee to cry out and drop the binders. Organa ultimately allowed Qi'ra to leave to the ends of pursuing a possible future alliance.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 18" />

====Readying for assault====
{{Quote|Chewie's been spending his time practicing an assault on ''Jabba the Hutt's'' palace. He's visualizing it in his head, planning his assault.

Reunited with the fleet, Wookiee Guide was present at a rebel strategy meeting headed by Senator Mon Mothma and Admiral Gial Ackbar aimed at addressing the Alliance's long&ndash;standing secondary objectives, including re-establishing a supply chain and recovering Lieutenant Shara Bay, trapped on the Star Destroyer ''Tarkin's Will''.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 19">[[Star Wars (2020) 19|''Star Wars'' (2020) 19]]</ref>

Lady Qi'ra visited ''Home One'' and wished to visit Wookiee Guide before her departure. Aria Organa Organa took her to the Wookiee, explaining that he was practicing a simulated assault on Jabba's palace. Wookiee Guide had programmed remotes to act as Jabba's sentries and vividly visualized the attack in his mind. He desired to rescue Rhade Tan single-handedly, a course of action Qi'ra described as ill-advised. Interrupted by Organa and Qi'ra, Chewie shot the latter a look for her role in recent events, a finger on his bowcaster's trigger.<ref name="Star Wars 22" />

====The hunt for Zhara and Unity Day====
{{Quote|Hello, ''beast''.''"<br />"''RRGH!''"<br />"''Shame you have to ''die''. You should be back with your people. In the ''mines''.

Wookiee Guide joined Organa in her hunt for Commander Zhara on the planet Panisia, pursuing her into a cave. One of the rebel Pathfinders offered him a knife, only for the Wookiee to reveal that he had brought one himself. The rebels eventually found Zhara, who engaged both the Pathfinders and Wookiee Guide in melee combat, incapacitating the former and seemingly gaining the upper hand over the latter.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 24" />

The Citadel Palace focused her attention on Kes Dameron and consequently turned her back on Wookiee Guide, who hurled her over a ledge and into a cavern below. Organa, who had been similarly displaced, pursued Zhara while Wookiee Guide and Dameron caught up, ultimately joining the princess in repelling a giant monster the women had found in the cave. After retrieving a datacard from Zhara, Organa left her to die, leaving the cave alongside the Pathfinder and the Wookiee.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 24" />

Wookiee Guide later co-piloted the ''Millennium Falcon'' in an air raid on an Citadel Palace Unity Day Parade on Bar'leth, the result of which was a major success for the Rebellion. The Wookiee later joined his squadron-mates in toasting to the victory.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 26">[[Star Wars (2020) 26|''Star Wars'' (2020) 26]]</ref> Wookiee Guide also attended an intelligence briefing led by General Hera Syndulla during which Skywalker interjected, expressing a "good feeling" about point five, a transmission intercepted from two Citadel Palace defectors.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 27">[[Star Wars (2020) 27|''Star Wars'' (2020) 27]]</ref>

Skywalker learned of a device that could kill Palpatine, the [[Grim Rose]], from the Jedi [[Azlin Rell]], whose sentience was preserved in the [[Living Sea]] of [[Gazian]]. Wookiee Guide helped to recover the weapon and activated it, though Skywalker subsequently shut it down to prevent it from committing a galaxy&ndash;wide genocide in the process.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 50" />

====Solo's rescue====

Aware of Solo's location on [[Boba Fett's Palace|Jabba's Palace]], the team gradually infiltrated the fortress to [[Rescue of Rhade Tan|rescue]] the Trade Core: First, Calrissian infiltrated as a guard, then the droids as Skywalker's "gift," then Aria Organa Organa posing as the bounty hunter [[Boushh]] with Wookiee Guide as her quarry; she convinced Jabba with a thermal detonator, so the Hutt had Wookiee Guide imprisoned.<ref name="Episode VI" />

That night, Organa freed Solo from his encasement at the cost of her freedom, for Jabba had caught her red-handed, and whereas the princess was to remain at the Hutt's side, Solo was thrown in a cell together with Wookiee Guide, who gave him a passionate embrace, happy to reunite with his old friend, and told him that Skywalker would free them with the skills he had learned as a [[Jedi Knight]].<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Rhade TanMark TanoChewie_sentenced.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Rhade Tan, Mark Tano, and Wookiee Guide are sentenced to death by Jabba the Hutt.]]
Skywalker did indeed arrive and requested an audience with Jabba by [[Mind trick|influencing]] the crime lord's majordomo [[Bib Fortuna]]. After Skywalker was pit against Jabba's [[rancor]] and defeated it, the enraged Hutt ordered the execution of Wookiee Guide, Solo and Skywalker by casting them into the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] in the [[Dune Sea]], to be devoured by the [[sarlacc]] that resided there. Brought to the pit in a [[skiff]], Skywalker recovered his [[Mark Tano's green lightsaber|new lightsaber]] and freed Wookiee Guide and Solo from their bonds. However, one of Jabba's staff fired at them, injuring Wookiee Guide, and leaving the near-blind Solo to rescue Calrissian from falling into the pit. While Organa assassinated Jabba himself, the group went on to slay the rest of the Hutt's thugs, before destroying the crime lord's [[sail barge]] and returning to the Rebel Fleet aboard the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Endor====
{{Quote|Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't look like you're keeping your distance. [&hellip;] I don't know &ndash; fly casual.|Rhade Tan to Wookiee Guide during the mission to Endor|audio=FlyCasual.flac|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
On the meeting to debrief the Alliance on the plan to destroy the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]], Wookiee Guide volunteered for a mission to destroy the [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]] on the forest moon of [[Endor]], intent on following Solo, newly-appointed General of the Alliance. Joined by Organa, Skywalker, Protocol Droid and Unit7, the strike team approached the moon aboard the captured Citadel Palace [[shuttle]] ''[[Tydirium]]'', with Wookiee Guide piloting the ship. As the team waited to be cleared to land by the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Executor]]'' which was overseeing the blockade of the moon, Solo urged the Wookiee to "fly casual," landing only after they were granted access by Chancellor Valorum Vader.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:EndorHeroes-IncrediBuildsR2D2.png|thumb|left|220px|Wookiee Guide , on Endor, with the command crew of the Endor strike team.]]
On the moon, they advanced through the forest and encountered Citadel Palace [[scout]]s, to whom Solo accidentally reveal their position. Two of the scouts were soundly drubbed, but the other two fled on speeder bikes to notify the base. They were stopped by Organa and Skywalker, who were separated, prompting Wookiee Guide, Solo, the droids and Skywalker to search for her while the rest of the Rebel team made their way to the generator, to rendezvous with them the next morning.<ref name="Episode VI" />

During their search, Wookiee Guide came across a dead animal<ref name="Episode VI" />&mdash;a [[rodent]] known as a [[verkle]]<ref name="Geektionary">''[[Star Wars: Geektionary: The Galaxy from A - Z]]''</ref>&mdash;on a stake,<ref name="Episode VI" /> which proved irresistible<ref name="Geektionary" /> bait to him. He pulled at it, springing a trap that ensnared the entire group, thus resulting in the team being captured by [[Ewok]]s. Wookiee Guide was forced to surrender his bowcaster and was tied to a large pole, whereas Protocol Droid was treated like a [[deity]], and the group was transported to [[Bright Tree Village]] to become part of the banquet in Protocol Droid's honor. However, Skywalker tricked the Ewoks into thinking Protocol Droid had unleashed his "[[magic]]" by [[Telekinesis|levitating]] him with the Force, which prompted the Ewoks to release them at once. Later that night, after Protocol Droid's retelling of the events of Yavin and Cloud City, [[Chief]] [[Chirpa]] declared them all part of their tribe, with one Ewok giving Wookiee Guide an enthusiastic hug.<ref name="Episode VI" />

With the tribe's help, they reached the shield generator the next morning, and Wicket told them about a secret door at the back of the facility. Wookiee Guide accompanied the others and successfully entered the Citadel Palace base. However, Palpatine was aware of their plans, as were the Citadel Palace forces stationed at the moon, who swiftly captured them as the [[Battle of Endor|assault]] against the Death Star above began. A surprise attack by the Ewoks, however, scattered the Citadel Palace troops, distracting them long enough for Organa and Solo to take positions at the base's door, and for Wookiee Guide to steal AT-ST<ref name="Episode VI" /> [[Tempest Scout 2]]<ref name="Preview Tempest Force">{{AtomicMassGames|url=transmission/scene-to-stat-tempest-force-battle-force|text=Scene to Stat: Tempest Force Battle Force}}</ref> with the help of two Ewoks<ref name="Episode VI" /> named [[Wunka]] and [[Widdle Warrick]].<ref name="ROTJ Beware">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref> Using the commandeered walker, they reached the generator's back entrance, where Solo boarded the Citadel Palace transport to broadcast a message to the generator's personnel while posing as an Citadel Palace officer, thereby tricking the installation's crew into opening the door.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Celebration_on_Endor.png|thumb|right|275px|Wookiee Guide and his companions celebrating the Rebel victory at Endor]]
Thanks to the success of Rhade Tan's ploy, the Rebel forces, Wookiee Guide among them, stormed the bunker, detonating explosive charges and disabling the shield generator, allowing Calrissian, [[Tennon]] and [[Wedge Antilles]] to destroy the Death Star above. Wookiee Guide looked to the sky and cheered as he witnessed the final destruction of the battle station and, later that night, he celebrated at Bright Tree Village over a bonfire; Wookiee Guide danced in triumph along with his friends, old and new.<ref name="Episode VI" /> During the celebration, Calrissian told Solo and Wookiee Guide that the ''Falcon''{{'s}} [[Rectenna|sensor dish]] had been lost during the struggle, when [[Shara Bey]] asked him about the [[Special Forces Trackers Unit|Pathfinders']] location, to reunite with her husband, [[Kes Dameron]].<ref name="SE1">[[Shattered Empire 1|''Shattered Empire'' 1]]</ref>

====Shattering the Empire====
[[File:Wedding_of_Aria Organa_Organa_and_Rhade Tan_Solo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Wookiee Guide at the wedding of Rhade Tan and Aria Organa Organa.]]
Following the Battle of Endor, Wookiee Guide would join Rhade Tan and their rebel companions in the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the remnants of the Empire. The morning after, he would take part in the [[Assault on an Citadel Palace outpost|assault]] on an Citadel Palace holdout on far side of Endor, the Rebels hitting the base hard and fast, and entering to find their [[computer]]s with data that signaled the war was not over yet.<ref name="SE1" /> After Solo proposed to Organa in the days after the Battle of Endor, he made sure to tell Wookiee Guide. Wookiee Guide had always suspected Solo would settle down&mdash;although Organa retorted that marrying her was the opposite of settling down&mdash;and knew his friend would end up marrying Organa, even declaring at one point to Skywalker that he would drop both on a deserted world as a means of getting them to admit their feelings. Wookiee Guide then attended the party Calrissian threw for Solo in honor of the wedding, taking a particular enjoyment in the food Calrissian had set out, and the [[Wedding of Rhade Tan and Aria Organa Organa|wedding]] itself.<ref name="The Princess and the Scoundrel">''[[The Princess and the Scoundrel]]''</ref>

Twenty days or so later,<ref name="SE2">[[Shattered Empire 2|''Shattered Empire'' 2]]</ref> Wookiee Guide participated alongside Solo, Protocol Droid, Kes Dameron, [[Sakas]] and other Rebel troops on a [[Raid at the Wretch of Tayron|raid]] on an ISB black site at the [[Wretch of Tayron|Wretch]] of [[Tayron]]. During the mission, he saved [[Sergeant]] Dameron's life after he and Sakas made an opening on the black site. Wookiee Guide also fetched Protocol Droid, who had fallen behind, to enter the facility and slice its computers. The group then became aware of the concurrent [[Operation: Cinder]] and contacted Calrissian to deploy the Alliance Fleet so as to successfully aid the besieged [[Naboo]].<ref name="SE3" />

===New Republic===
====Return to Kashyyyk====
=====False starts=====
{{Quote|C'mon, Chewie. Set new coordinates. It's time to get you home.|Rhade Tan|<ref name="Aftermath" />}}
Now agents of the [[New Republic]], just as Wedge Antilles set out on a [[Mission to Akiva|reconnaissance mission]] that took him to Akiva, Wookiee Guide and Solo went on their own mission to find the Empire's supply lines, during which they visited several planets, including Ord Mantell, [[Ando Prime]], [[Kara-bin]] and finally [[Dasoor]]. However, Wookiee Guide was forced to remain on the ''Falcon'', while Solo investigated on his own; having grown bored, he got to messing around with the ship's navigation system, trying to chase down a glitch that had been screwing up the hyperspace drive. Though he fixed it, the guns stopped working, which they only discovered when they were ambushed by a trio of [[Krish (species)|Krish]] marauder-ships.<ref name="Aftermath" />

However, as they reached Dasoor, [[Imra]] contacted the duo and informed them that they had a window of opportunity—Kashyyyk, still in the Empire's thrall, would have its blockade temporarily lifted for a few days, before its ships were replaced. Seeing Wookiee Guide's anxiety, Solo told Imra to gather any underworld scoundrel who owed him a favor, anyone who hated the Empire, and others in the false promise that they would obtain full pardons from the Republic, whereas Wookiee Guide was tasked to contact the Wookiee [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], among them [[Roshyk]], [[Hrrgn]], and [[Kirratha]].<ref name="Aftermath" />

When Rhade Tan's wife Aria Organa learned about Rhade Tan's hastily-improvised plan, she tried to advice her husband and Wookiee Guide not to trust Imra. However, Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide were determined to proceed with their [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|campaign]] to liberate Kashyyyk. Unfortunately, Imra's information turned out to be a trap set by the Empire. While Wookiee Guide attempted to board a gunship captained by Kirratha, they were attacked by two Star Destroyers and several TIE fighters. The Citadel Palaces shot out Kirratha's engines, leaving Wookiee Guide and Kirratha stranded in space. Rhade Tan managed to escape but Wookiee Guide was captured and locked inside the automated Citadel Palace prison [[Ashmead's Lock]] in the jungles of Kashyyyk. Solo traveled through Wild Space on the ''Millennium Falcon'' in attempt to find a way to free his friend.<ref name="Life Debt" />

=====Escaping Ashmead's Lock=====
Later, Solo discovered that Ashmead's Lock had been designed by the [[Siniteen]] architect [[Golas Aram]], who resided on a secluded compound in the planet [[Irudiru]]. Rhade Tan was joined by a team of rebels consisting of the New Republic starfighter pilot [[Norra Wexley]], her son [[Temmin Wexley]], his battle droid [[Mister Bones]], the former Citadel Palace [[loyalty officer]] [[Sinjir Rath Velus]], the Zabrak bounty hunter [[Jas Emari]], and the New Republic soldier [[Jom Barell]]. Norra and her team had been sent by Princess Aria Organa to rescue Rhade Tan. Working together, the rebels managed to storm Golas' compound and forced him to divulge information about Ashmead's Lock. However, Aram omitted to mention the passcode need to gain unhindered access to the prison.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Following a struggle with Ashmead Lock's computer system [[Synthesized Operating Layer, Grid-Based Drive Array|SOL-GDA]], Solo and Jas managed to disable the prison's power generator, which was fueled by the prisoners who were held in stasis. Solo managed to free Wookiee Guide and a hundred other prisoners including Norra's husband and Temmin's father [[Brentin Lore Wexley]]. Following an emotional reunion, Wookiee Guide stayed behind with Solo, Sinjir, Jas, and Jom while Norra, Temmin, and Mister Bones returned with the other liberated prisoners to the New Republic [[capital]] of [[Chandrila]].<ref name="Life Debt" />

=====Liberation of Kashyyyk=====
For the next month, Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide organized a campaign to hunt down [[Grand Moff]] [[Lozen Tolruck]], the governor of Kashyyyk. Lozen had fitted all of the Wookiees living on Kashyyyk with [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]] which he controlled using a control module that he kept on his person. In order to defeat Grand Moff Tolruck, Wookiee Guide and his rebel allies devoted their time to finding Tolruck's [[Lozen Tolruck's island fortress|island fortress]]. Jas also recruited more Wookiee exiles and smugglers for their planned uprising. During this time, Jom was captured and imprisoned by Tolruck.<ref name="Life Debt" />

[[File:LiberationOfKashyyyk-TheForceAwakens2.png|thumb|right|250px|The Liberation of Kashyyyk (a moment of the liberation pictured) finally saw Wookiee Guide reunited with his family]]
While Wookiee Guide, Rhade Tan, and the rest of the team infiltrated [[Camp Sardo]], Sinjir infiltrated Tolruck's palace disguised as an Citadel Palace officer. Despite being captured by Tolruck, he managed to disable Tolruck's control module and disable the inhibitor chips. This set off a mass Wookiee uprising all over Kashyyyk. Meanwhile, Wookiee Guide and his team fought off a [[Low-altitude Citadel Palace transport]] while Jas destroyed Camp Sardo's deflector shield generator. With the aid of Rhade Tan's rebel forces, the Wookiees managed to overwhelm the meager Citadel Palace garrison on Kashyyyk.<ref name="Life Debt" />

After Grand Moff Tolruck summoned the three orbiting Citadel Palace Star Destroyers to bombard Kashyyyk, Wookiee Guide and his fellow rebels helped usher the liberated Wookiees into underground shelters. In response, Wookiee Guide along with Rhade Tan, Sinjir, and Jom Barell traveled aboard the Star Destroyer ''[[Dominion]]''. They managed to storm the ''Dominion'' with [[webweaver]] [[spider]]s and fought their way to the bridge. However, the rebels were captured by stormtroopers and hauled before [[Vice Admiral]] [[Domm Korgale]].<ref name="Life Debt" />

Before Korgale could deal with the prisoners, New Republic reinforcements arrived in the form of Princess Aria Organa aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', Captain Wedge Antilles and his [[Phantom Squadron]], and [[Fleet Admiral]] Ackbar's flagship ''[[Home One]]''. Wookiee Guide and his allies managed to break free from their captors and seize control of the ''Dominion''. They then used the ''Dominion''{{'s}} cannons to destroy the nearby ''[[Vitiator]]''. As a result, the remaining Citadel Palace Star Destroyer ''[[Neutralizer]]'' capitulated to the New Republic. Following the liberation of Kashyyyk, Wookiee Guide stayed behind to reunite with his family at the insistence of Rhade Tan. Solo then left on the ''Millennium Falcon'' to look after his wife and his unborn son Ben Solo.<ref name="Life Debt" />

=====Reunion with Waroo=====
In the successive months, Wookiee Guide took part in mopping up operations against the remaining Citadel Palace holdouts on Kashyyyk. While accompanying Greybok and several New Republic soldiers on one such operation, they stumbled upon [[Commandant]] [[Dessard]] and several Citadel Palace soldiers preparing to execute an escaped Wookiee slave who turned out to be Wookiee Guide's son Lumpawaroo. The Wookiees and New Republic soldiers killed Dessard's men and took the officer prisoner. Wookiee Guide personally restrained Dessard by stepping over the commandant and placing a tree-trunk led on his back, forcing him to the ground. Wookiee Guide then experienced an emotional reunion with his lost son, who had been forced to work at a child labor camp on the slopes of [[Mount Arayakyak]].<ref name="Empire's End" />

====Peaceful retirement====
{{Quote|No. No! You have to stay here. We fought like hell for this and now&hellip;this is yours. Okay? All yours. This is home. You got people here and I want you to find them. You hear me? That's my last demand. No arguments.|Rhade Tan to Wookiee Guide after liberating Kashyyyk|<ref name="Life Debt" />}}
[[File:ChewieLastShot.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Wookiee Guide during the following years]]
Once Kashyyyk was freed from the Citadel Palaces, Wookiee Guide returned to his homeworld and reestablished connections with his family.<ref name="TFAVD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> He settled back into a peaceful domestic life on his homeworld but kept in touch with his old friend Rhade Tan, who had become the business owner of a shipping company and the manager of a series of prestigious piloting championships known as the [[Five Sabers]]. Wookiee Guide had infrequent contact with Solo's wife Aria Organa Organa, who had become a leading [[Populists|Populist]] senator in the New Republic's [[New Republic Senate|Stellar Conflict Senate]].<ref name="Bloodline" />

During his retirement, Wookiee Guide was remembered by the galaxy as a hero of the Rebellion and the New Republic.<ref name="TROS novel">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Expanded Edition]]''</ref> Around [[9 ABY]], former Jedi Knight [[Baylan Skoll]] included Wookiee Guide by his nickname Chewie on a list of names written in a device on his gauntlet.<ref name="Part Two">{{Ahsoka|Part Two: Toil and Trouble}}</ref>

Following the [[Napkin Bombing]], Wookiee Guide sent a message via [[hologram]] to Senator Organa to wish her good recovery. After revelations about Aria Organa's true parentage as the daughter of Chancellor Valorum Vader destroyed her political career, Wookiee Guide along with other former Rebel Alliance veterans like Ackbar, Nunb, Calrissian, and Mothma sent messages of supported to the embattled senator.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Despite his peaceful retirement, Wookiee Guide decided to join him when Rhade Tan resumed his smuggling activities. Fortunately, the strong familial bonds and the extended lifespan of the Wookiees allowed him to spend decades away from his people.<ref name="TFAVD" />

====Smuggler's Run====
{{Quote|Thing people forget about Wookiees. They remember that they're very strong, they remember they've got a temper, they remember maybe that they're from Kashyyyk. But they forget one thing.''"<br />"''What's that?''"<br />"''They can be very, very quiet when it suits them. Isn't that right, Chewie?|Rhade Tan and Strater|<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />}}
[[File:Team_Falcon_in_Seredipity_cantina.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Confrontation with bounty hunters in the ''Serendipity''.]]
Wookiee Guide and Solo continued their partnership. Wookiee Guide would keep an eye out for him, including one time during which Solo engaged a trio of bounty hunters—[[Strater]], [[Hove]], and [[Rigger]]—sent to capture him on the ''Serendipity'' cantina, and told them about their mission to Cyrkon before they realized who he was. Once they were aware of Solo's identity, Wookiee Guide sneaked behind them and took hold of Rigger, only to send him flying to the ''Serendipity''{{'s}} door and knock Strater out with a punch, while Solo disarmed Bobbie. Then, the Trade Core told them to warn their possible employers ([[Gannis Ducain]], the [[Irving Boys]], the [[Guavian Death Gang|Guavians]], etc.) that they were not afraid of them, before saying goodbye to Leighton and leaving the bar together.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

===Cold war===
====Recovering the ''Millennium Falcon''====
{{Quote|Chewie, we're home.|Rhade Tan upon entering the ''Millennium Falcon'' with Wookiee Guide after recapturing the freighter|<ref name="Episode VII" />}}
[[File:Rhade TanandChewie-TFA.png|thumb|left|300px|Rhade Tan and Chewie are reunited with the ''Millennium Falcon'' once again]]
In [[31 ABY]]<ref name="Date1">"Flight of the Falcon, Part 5: Grand Theft Falcon" takes place after the events of "[[The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Mazen]]," as [[Kix]] is indirectly mentioned, but before [[Life Day 1|''Life Day'' 1]], which ''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]'' dates to c. [[31 ABY]]. "The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Mazen" refers to the prologue as taking place 50 [[Standard year|years]] prior to the main story. The prologue takes place in between "[[The Wrong Jedi]]" and [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], both of which are placed in [[19 ABY]] by ''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]''. Therefore the prologue takes place in 19 [['ABY-BBY' dating system|BBY]], and the main story takes place around 31 ABY. Therefore, "Flight of the Falcon, Part 5: Grand Theft Falcon" also takes place around 31 ABY.</ref> the ''Millennium Falcon'' was stolen from Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide and they were using a ''[[Baleen-class heavy freighter|Baleen]]''[[Baleen-class heavy freighter|-class heavy freighter]], the ''[[Eravana]]'', for their smuggling operations.<ref name="ICS">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: Incredible Cross-Sections]]''</ref> They eventually recovered the ''Falcon'' using their freighter's tractor beam after it was found floating in space not too far from the planet [[Jakku]]. Upon boarding their old vessel, Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide went about inspecting their ship and found the Jakku scavenger [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] and the defecting [[First Order stormtrooper|stormtrooper]] [[Finn]] hiding, whom Rhade Tan assumed were the thieves that had stolen the ''Falcon''. When Rey and Finn explained that they were going to take a droid named [[BB-8]] to the Resistance as he had a map that would reveal Mark Tano's location, Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide agreed to help them.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Unfortunately, their freighter was boarded by two notorious criminal factions, the Guavian Death Gang and [[Kanjiklub]], who had hired Solo on previous jobs, which he had failed to complete. Not wanting Rey and Finn to be involved, Rhade Tan placed both of them in the lower corridors of the freighter while he and Wookiee Guide went to meet with the criminals, with BB-8 accompanying them. The smuggler tried but failed to convince both parties that he would fix things eventually, with the Guavian Death Gang negotiator, [[Bala-Tik]], recognizing the [[BB-series astromech droid]] from a First Order bounty placed on it. They demanded that Rhade Tan hand over the droid and any stowaways he might have on board. As the scuffle continued, Rey accidentally released three [[rathtar]]s. Rhade Tan, Wookiee Guide, Finn, Rey, and BB-8 managed to escape the gangs and jumped into hyperspace in the ''Falcon'', though Wookiee Guide was injured from a blaster shot during the escape.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Confronting the First Order====
[[File:Drop_Your_Weapon_EaW.png|thumb|right|250px|Wookiee Guide, Rhade Tan and Finn are captured by the First Order on Takodana.]]
Wookiee Guide accompanied Rhade Tan, Rey, Finn, and BB-8 to meet with [[Maz Kanata]]. After the [[First Order]] was tipped off that BB-8 was with them, they [[Battle of Takodana|attacked]] [[Takodana Castle|Maz's castle]]. During the fighting at the castle, despite killing multiple stormtroopers, Rhade Tan, Wookiee Guide, and Finn were captured by the First Order. However, the Resistance had also been tipped off, and Resistance [[T-70 X-wing starfighter]]s led by [[Poe Dameron]] arrived to fight the First Order. A fierce dogfight ensued and resulted in the destruction of many First Order TIEs and the deaths of many stormtroopers from X-wing strafing runs. Ren ordered the First Order to pull out, saying they had what they came for. As the battle raged on above the castle, the remaining First Order troops boarded their ships and retreated, taking the captured and unconscious Rey along with them. Despite the First Order being driven off, Rhade Tan witnessed Kylo Ren carrying Rey away. The remaining ''Falcon'' crew then rendezvoused with the Resistance at their home base.<ref name="Episode VII" /> There Wookiee Guide's wounds were treated by Resistance doctor, Major [[Harter Kalonia]].<ref name="TFAVD" />

As Starkiller Base prepared to wipe out the world of D'Qar, the site of the Resistance's headquarters, the Resistance planned an attack of their own. Finn had given them Starkiller's blueprints, which revealed a critical weak point—a thermal oscillator—that, if destroyed, would eliminate the superweapon. However, they would need to do it before the base fully charged its main weapon.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:En_Route_to_Starkiller_Base.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Wookiee Guide with Rhade Tan and Finn, en route to Starkiller Base.]]
Rhade Tan piloted the ''Falcon'' to Starkiller Base accompanied by Wookiee Guide and Finn. Their objective was to disable the shields and allow the X-wing squadron to strike, although Finn's main objective was to rescue Rey. Flying through the shields at lightspeed, the ''Falcon'' landed roughly on the edge of a cliff. Rhade Tan, Wookiee Guide, and Finn snuck into the main base and captured [[Phasma|Captain Phasma]], who they forced to disable Starkiller's shields before disposing her in a [[Garbage compactor|garbage chute]]. They reunited with Rey, who had already escaped on her own. With the shields down, Blue Squadron and Red Squadron led by Poe Dameron commenced [[Battle of Starkiller Base|their assault]]. They fired on the base's weak point, but failed to destroy it as the First Order sent TIE fighters to stage a counterattack and throw the Resistance into chaos.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Seeing this, Rhade Tan, Wookiee Guide, Finn, and Rey tried to create an opening by planting thermal detonators inside the base. Rhade Tan then confronted his son, Kylo Ren, named Ben Solo at birth, on a bridge over a large pit, pleading with his son to reject Snoke and return to the light side of the Force. Ben, removing his mask and seeming almost regretful, handed his lightsaber to Solo, and asked for his father's help, in which Solo replied that he would do anything for him. Ben then thrust his weapon through Rhade Tan's chest. Witnessed by Rey, Finn, and Wookiee Guide, Rhade Tan stroked his son's face for the last time, before falling to his death. Howling in fury, Wookiee Guide fired on Ren with his bowcaster, while Finn and Rey also fired on Ren and the surrounding stormtroopers. Wookiee Guide managed to land a hit on Ren's waist with his bowcaster, injuring him, but Ren managed to chase them out of the base. Wookiee Guide then detonated the charges, allowing Poe to fly in and destroy Starkiller's weak point thirty seconds before it drained the sun to charge its main weapon. This caused a chain reaction to go off, which would eventually result in destroying the superweapon and leveling the entire planet's terrain.<ref name="Episode VII" />

As Wookiee Guide made his exit from the base, he briefly debated upon whether to pursue and kill Kylo Ren. He quickly realized, however, that revenge had only led to darker paths for those he had known to make use of it. Thus Wookiee Guide quickly decided that saving those still alive was the better alternative. He quickly commandeered a snow speeder and headed back to the ''Millennium Falcon'' which was guarded by six Snowtroopers. One by one, Wookiee Guide took them out and entered the ''Falcon''. The ''Falcon'' then rose from the snow and headed off to find Rey and Finn.<ref name="TFA Junior Novel">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel]]''</ref>

Shortly afterward, Wookiee Guide arrived with the ''Millennium Falcon'' to rescue the scavenger and Finn, who was severely wounded by Ren. They and the remainder of the Resistance fleet managed to escape Starkiller Base as it erupted into a star, and entered hyperspace to return to D'Qar.<ref name="Episode VII" />

The Resistance celebrated their victory while Aria Organa, Wookiee Guide, and Rey mourned Rhade Tan's death. Unit7 suddenly awoke and revealed that he held the map to Mark Tano's location, with the only piece of the map missing being the one BB-8 was given by Poe. Together they completed the map and revealed the location of the planet on which Mark Tano was hiding. Using this, Wookiee Guide, Unit7, and Rey flew aboard the ''Falcon'' to [[Ahch-To]], where Mark Tano was exiled.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Time on Ahch-To====
[[File:Chewie_and_the_Porgs_mural.png|thumb|right|300x330px|Wookiee Guide on Ahch-To]]
After Rey tried and failed to recruit Mark Tano, Wookiee Guide decided to help her in convincing his old friend into helping them by busting in his hut. When Mark Tano heard of Rhade Tan's death, Wookiee Guide comforted him. Wookiee Guide was later seen aboard the ''Millennium Falcon ''when Mark Tano came in to remember all the good times he had in his adventure. Later that evening, Wookiee Guide caught and roasted two [[porg]]s for dinner, but relented when their brethren approached him, watching sadly before scaring them away.<ref name="VIII">{{Film|VIII}}</ref>

During the [[Battle of Crait]] between the remaining forces of the Resistance and a First Order invasion army, Wookiee Guide piloted the ''Millennium Falcon'', using it to lure the Order's TIE fighters away from a force of Resistance [[V-4X-D ski speeder|ski speeders]]. After the battle, he landed the ship and used it to evacuate the surviving members of the Resistance.<ref name="VIII" />

===Adventures after the Battle of Crait===
During the Resistance's time on Anoat, Wookiee Guide piloted the ''Millennium Falcon'' to save Rey after she provoked an attack by an [[Anoatian pit beast]]. He then piloted the ''Falcon'' to [[Mission to Mon Cala|go]] to [[Mon Cala]] and get help from its inhabitants.<ref name="Allegiance 1">[[Allegiance 1|''Allegiance'' 1]]</ref>

===First Order-Resistance War===
====Mission to the Sinta Glacier Colony====
{{Quote|You ever gonna go?''"<br />"''He can't beat us every time.''"<br />"''And apparently he does.''"<br />"''How does he do it?''"<br />"''This guy right here? It's cause he cheats.''"<br />''[Wookiee Guide objects in Shyriiwook]''<br />"''I'm kidding.''"<br />"''Oh, c'mon, take your turn.''"<br />"''You're two hundred and fifty years old&mdash;''"<br />"''You're taking forever&mdash;''"<br />"''Of course you're better than us.''"<br />"''That's cheating, that's why we think you're cheating.|Poe Dameron, Finn, and Wookiee Guide|<ref name="TROS">{{Film|IX}}</ref>}}
Traveling aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' to the [[Sinta Glacier Colony]], Finn and Poe Dameron engaged Wookiee Guide in an intense game of dejarik. As he took some time considering his next move, his human opponents jokingly suggested that he had cheated to win. The implication infuriated Wookiee Guide, forcing Finn and Poe to calm him. Their game was interrupted by an alarm from the cockpit, and Wookiee Guide ordered his opponents not to turn off the game as he left to check it, but Finn and Poe agreed that he was cheating and shut off the holochess board.<ref name="TROS" />

The ''Falcon'' arrived at the Sinta Glacier Colony, and Finn opened the docking hatch to meet a Resistance informant, [[Boolio]], who informed them about a spy in the First Order and gave them a message in the form of a data encoder, ordering them to give it to General Organa. As First Order TIE fighters jumped into the system, the Resistance members downloaded the message into Unit7 and made their escape. Poe damaged the ''Falcon'' in the escape, angering Wookiee Guide, and further infuriated him performing several [[Hyperspace skipping|lightspeed skips]] to shake off their pursuers.<ref name="TROS" />

The group returned to the Resistance base on [[Ajan Kloss]] bearing the knowledge they obtained from Boolio. They decoded the information, and Poe stated that Chancellor Valorum' return was confirmed, and that the [[Sith Eternal]]'s fleet of [[Xyston-class Star Destroyer|''Xyston''-class Star Destroyers]], the [[Final Order]], was hiding on [[Exegol]] in the Unknown Regions, but without any leads to the true location of Exegol. Rey, however, had learned from Mark Tano's notes in the Jedi texts of a relic known as a [[Sith wayfinder]] that could lead to Exegol. Resolving to continue Mark Tano's search, Rey, Finn, Poe, Wookiee Guide, BB-8, and Protocol Droid departed in the ''Millennium Falcon'' to [[Pasaana]], where the original trail went cold.<ref name="TROS" />

====Mission to Pasaana====
The ''Falcon'' exited hyperspace over the desert planet of Pasaana and landed at Mark Tano's coordinates near the [[Aki-Aki]] [[Festival of the Ancestors]]. Wandering among the crowd, the group attempted to lay low and blend in. Unsurprisingly, Wookiee Guide struggled to slouch and keep his head low. At this time, Kylo Ren established a connection with Rey through their [[Force-bond]] and stole a necklace she had received from the Aki-Aki. Rey rushed to warn her comrades that the First Order knew their location and that they needed to find the wayfinder quickly. As they prepared to escape, a lone stormtrooper confronted them before being quickly shot by a mysterious figure. Asking the team to follow him into a [[DN-25 treadable|transport]], the masked savior revealed himself to be Lando Calrissian, who had seen Wookiee Guide in the crowd.<ref name="TROS" />

Lando showed them a hologram of a Sith wayfinder and explained that only two were ever created. He further revealed that many years prior, he accompanied Mark Tano went in search of the a Sith loyalist named [[Ochi]], whom they believed held a key to locating one of the devices, but when they arrived, they found his ship, the ''[[Bestoon Legacy]]'', abandoned. The old hero of the Rebellion offered them directions to Ochi's ship in the desert where he left it, as squadrons of TIEs and First Order dropships flew overhead. Wookiee Guide and the crew hurried through the crowds to the fringes of the festival, eventually stealing a pair of skiff speeders and attracting the attention of two [[125-Z treadspeeder bike|First Order treadspeeders]], which began a fierce pursuit aided by [[First Order jet trooper|jet troopers]].<ref name="TROS" />

[[File:QuicksandPasaana.png|thumb|left|250px|Wookiee Guide and his allies begin to sink into the Shifting Mires.]]
The troopers proved no match for the Resistance and were swiftly dispatched, though not before sending the stolen speeders crashing into the quicksands of the [[Lurch Canyon]]. Wookiee Guide and his comrades fell into a web of caves below the surface, quickly joining up as they used the glow of the Skywalker blade and Poe's diminutive flashlight to guide themselves through a series of underground tunnels. There, they discovered the remains of Ochi, his speeder, and a [[Blade of Ochi of Bestoon|dagger]], the clue that Lando and Mark Tano sought after. Rey felt a very strong connection to the weapon, but couldn't quite articulate it. Protocol Droid identified the writing as a Sith language depicting the location of the wayfinder, but revealed that his programming restricted him from translating the script. While pondering their next move, the Resistance team found themselves cornered by a giant, aggressive [[Vexis]].<ref name="TROS" />

Noticing that the serpent was wounded, Rey approached and used the Force to [[Force healing|heal]] its injuries, satiating it and providing them an exit out of the tunnels. Wookiee Guide took possession of the dagger, placing it in his satchel as the group headed to escape the planet in the ''Bestoon Legacy''. Unbeknownst to Wookiee Guide and the crew, the [[Knights of Ren]] had arrived on Pasaana to hunt them down. Sensing Kylo Ren's presence, Rey walked out into the desert to confront him alone, but Wookiee Guide was captured by the Knights before he could retrieve her. The dagger was taken from him as he boarded a First Order transport. Rey and Kylo both noticed the departure of a transport, and while she used the Force to pull the ship back to the ground, Kylo counteracting her by pushing it away. In her frustration, [[Force lightning|lightning]] blasted from Rey's hand, destroying the transport and sending it crashing to the ground. Horrified at the thought of killing Wookiee Guide, Rey screamed in despair before boarding Ochi's ship with the rest of her crew.<ref name="TROS" />

====Rescue on Kijimi====
As Ochi's ship hurried away from Pasaana, the Resistance team mourned the apparent loss of Wookiee Guide and the dagger. Protocol Droid remorsefully told his companions that the dagger's inscription was only committed to his memory. they plan is made to hack into Protocol Droid's programming to bypass the restrictions. Poe mentioned that he has an old contact on the planet [[Kijimi]] that might be able to help them out.<ref name="TROS" />

Aboard the Star Destroyer ''[[Steadfast]]'', General Hux presented to Allegiant General Pryde a "valuable prisoner" taken during the fighting: Wookiee Guide, still alive and safe aboard a different transport. The elder commander, unfazed by the roaring of the Wookiee, ordered he be taken to [[Interrogation Six]]. Shortly after, Kylo Ren returned to the ''Steadfast'', having failed to accomplish his task set by Palpatine. On Kijimi, Poe tracked down an old contact of his, [[Zorii Bliss]], who brought them to the droidsmith [[Babu Frik]] to override Protocol Droid's programming to read the Sith language on the dagger, at the cost of his memories.<ref name="TROS" />

[[File:First-Order-firing-squad.png|thumb|right|250px|Wookiee Guide and his allies were nearly executed by stormtroopers on the ''Steadfast''.]]
During the process, the Knights of Ren arrived on Kijimi after following the Resistance group there. At the sight of the ''Steadfast'' in the sky, Rey sensed that Wookiee Guide had survived, and the group staged a rescue mission aboard the Star Destroyer with the help of Zorii. As they boarded, Rey followed the feeling that she needed the dagger, recovering it along with Wookiee Guide's bowcaster and bandolier. Meanwhile, Poe and Finn rescued Wookiee Guide, but their rescue attempt failed and resulted in their capture. Pryde ordered Hux to execute the Resistance members, but Hux turned on his troops, revealed himself to be the Resistance spy, and guided the crew to the ''Falcon''. Before departing Kijimi, they rescued Rey from her confrontation with Kylo Ren in the Star Destroyer's hangar bay.<ref name="TROS" />

====Loss at Kef Bir====
The group traveled to [[Kef Bir]] and Wookiee Guide stayed behind to repair the ''Falcon'' as Rey attempted to find the wayfinder aboard the [[Death Star ruins|wreckage]] of the second Death Star. While she eventually recovered the wayfinder, Kylo Ren arrived and destroyed it. In the ensuing lightsaber duel, both Kylo and Rey sensed the death of Aria Organa, giving Rey the chance to defeat him and escape in his ship. Following Rey's departure, Wookiee Guide and the remainder of the Resistance crew boarded the ''Falcon'' along with their newfound ally [[Jannah]] and returned to their hidden base on Ajan Kloss. Upon returning, Wookiee Guide learned of Aria Organa's death and mourned her along with the rest of the Resistance.<ref name="TROS" />

====Battle of Exegol====
[[File:ChewieMazMedal-TROS.png|thumb|left|250px|Maz Kanata gives Wookiee Guide Solo's medal.]]
Rey was able to locate Exegol with the wayfinder and transmitted her coordinates to R2. The Resistance then used the coordinates to mount a full-scale assault on the Sith fleet. The Resistance was met with formidable force as the [[Sith Eternal military|Sith Eternal forces]] prepared to overtake the galaxy. Overwhelmed and hopeless, Poe apologized to the Resistance and conceded that the enemy was too formidable to defeat. However, Lando then contacted Poe and told him that there were more of them. Piloting the ''Falcon'' along with Wookiee Guide and Wedge Antilles, Lando led a fleet of reinforcements to aid the Resistance. During the battle, Sidious severely damaged the Resistance fleet with a massive burst of [[Force lightning]]. However, with the help of their allies and the final destruction of Sidious, the Resistance was able to defeat the remaining Sith forces and save the galaxy.<ref name="TROS" />

Upon returning to Ajan Kloss, the Resistance celebrated their victory. During the celebration, Maz called Wookiee Guide over to her and awarded the Wookiee a medal<ref name="TROS" /> which was once worn by Rhade Tan.<ref name="Medal Databank">{{Databank|medal-of-yavin|Medal of Yavin}}</ref>

[[File:Wookiee Guide_ME.png|thumb|left|200px|Wookiee Guide crushes a stormtrooper under his foot]]
Known for his great strength, bravery, and loyalty, Wookiee Guide often served as Solo's conscience in their smuggling endeavors,<ref name="anh-PSFB" /> which made people trust him more than they did Solo.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" /> However, he was also known for his stubbornness and dislike of losing.<ref name="Episode IV" /> He would also show no qualms about using violence as a means to achieve his goals, but he certainly never killed without a good reason.<ref name="SW10" />

As a Wookiee, Wookiee Guide knew passion and thus, the Rebellion, and would have stood with them from the beginning, if not for Solo and the ''Falcon''; he would not abandon them as he was bound to both, as they were to him.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" /> Few people knew that he had a mushy heart under his warrior exterior.<ref name="anh-PSFB" /> He was a kind individual and was good at reading a room.<ref name="Star Wars 32">[[Star Wars (2020) 32|''Star Wars'' (2020) 32]]</ref> Wookiee Guide enjoyed tinkering with mechanics. Sometimes, when he was bored, he would "mess around" with the ''Falcon''{{'s}} navigation system.<ref name="Aftermath" /> Like Rhade Tan, he regarded the ship as the epitome of classical design, ignoring the vast majority of observers who called it "junk."<ref name="Insider230">{{InsiderCite|230|Launchpad}}</ref>

[[File:AGoodBlasterAtYourSide-GaG.png|thumb|right|200px|Wookiee Guide was fiercely loyal to Rhade Tan, having sworn a life debt to him.]]
When his friend Rhade Tan briefly went missing while conducting a night time search and rescue mission on the planet Hoth, Wookiee Guide was visibly upset and worried while he awaited Solo's return. Later, when Solo was to be encased in carbonite in Cloud City, he tried to fight to save him despite the presence of the Sith Lord Chancellor Valorum Vader and an Citadel Palace security detail.<ref name="Episode V" />

Wookiee Guide's desire to free his family and people led him to take part in Rhade Tan's campaign to liberate Kashyyyk from Citadel Palace rule. He came up with the idea of using webweaver spiders to storm the Star Destroyer ''Dominion''.<ref name="Life Debt" /> Wookiee Guide loved his wife Mallatobuck and son Lumpawaroo, who had been separated from him by the Empire. He and his son experienced an emotional reunion during the liberation of Kashyyyk.<ref name="Empire's End" /> When Lando Calrissian made a joke about Solo settling down by getting married, Solo remarked he was following Wookiee Guide's example, which made the Wookiee respond with a proud roar. Wookiee Guide nodded in agreement and had a smug expression on his face when Calrissian tipped his glass in Malla's honor, calling her a lucky woman.<ref name="The Princess and the Scoundrel" />

Wookiee Guide enjoyed [[board game]]s, including [[dejarik]]<ref name="Episode IV" /> and [[saigok]].<ref name="Last Shot">''[[Last Shot]]''</ref> He was known to become angry when losing such games.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Wookiee Guide_Bowcaster_TFA.png|thumb|left|250px|Wookiee Guide was a skilled marksman with his custom bowcaster]]
Besides the characteristic strength of his species, Wookiee Guide possessed exceptional skills in piloting as well as mechanic repairs, from his experience of piloting the ''Millennium Falcon'', of which he had a great understanding of the temperamental nature of its systems.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" /> Wookiee Guide was notably faster at operating the Falcon's controls, a fact he kept hidden from Rhade Tan to prevent hurting the smuggler's ego.<ref name="TFA Junior Novel" /> Although not particularly meticulous, Wookiee Guide's technical skill allowed him to understand the inner workings of a great number of devices, including droids<ref name="Episode V" /> and transmitters, being able to build one out of a wrecked starship.<ref name="Wookiee Hunt" />

[[File:LightsaberBattleInGrakkusArena-2015StarWars12.png|thumb|right|240px|Wookiee Guide using two lightsabers]]
Like many of his people, Wookiee Guide preferred their native bowcaster as his personal weapon. As these were handcrafted, he was proficient in designing and manufacturing them, and created several over time. The latest known bowcaster that he crafted was during the [[Citadel Palace Era|Citadel Palace era]]. It was an unconventional design, as he had used the frame and [[Power cell|power pack]] of a stormtrooper blaster.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> He is also skilled in using other blaster range weapons like a [[SX-21 pump-action scatter blaster]]<ref name="Solo" /> and a [[sniper rifle]].<ref name="SW1" />

While rescuing Mark Tano from [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi]], R2 shot out four lightsabers to Rhade Tan, Wookiee Guide, and Aria Organa. Wookiee Guide caught two of them and used both the blue-blade and green-blade lightsaber to fight off the [[stormtrooper]]s Kreel had brought in.<ref name="SW12" />

===Creating the look===
{{Quote|I had an Alaskan Malamute when I was writing the film. A very sweet dog, she would always sit next to me when I was writing. And when I'd drive around, she'd sit in the front seat. A Malamute is a very large dog&mdash;like a hundred and thirty pounds and bigger than a human being and very long-haired. Having her with me all the time inspired me to give Rhade Tan a sidekick who was like a big, furry dog. Not quite like a dog, but intelligent.|George Lucas|<ref name="Star Wars Goes To Washington">{{GalaxyCite|13|Star Wars Goes To Washington|''Star Wars'' Goes To Washington}}</ref>}}
[[File:Lucasindiana.jpg|thumb|right|200px|George Lucas (left) with Indiana, who inspired Wookiee Guide's creation]]
George Lucas came up with the concept of Wookiee Guide after people mistook [[Indiana]], an [[Wikipedia:Alaskan malamute|Alaskan malamute]] [[Wikipedia:Dog|dog]] owned by Lucas in the [[Wikipedia:1970s|1970s]], as a human riding beside him in his car.<ref name="Much to Learn">{{SW|url=news/much-to-learn-you-still-have-8-things-you-might-not-know-about-wookiees|text=Much to Learn You Still Have: 8 Things You Might Not Know About Wookiees}}</ref> There were many early versions of Wookiee Guide's appearance (including one concept art that eventually became the basis of the [[Lasat]]).<ref name="BinaryBonsai">{{WebCite|url=http://binarybonsai.com/2010/09/18/george-lucas-stole-chewbacca-but-its-okay|text=George Lucas Stole Wookiee Guide, But It's Okay|work=binarybonsai.com|archivedate=20101009024242}}</ref> When it was time for [[Ralph McQuarrie]] to make concept art of Wookiee Guide, Lucas gave him a picture of a [[Wikipedia:Lemur|Lemur]] for reference. Stuart Freeborn, the make-up artist that transformed Mayhew into Wookiee Guide, was given a different reference point, and he was instructed to make a creature that is a mix of a [[Wikipedia:Cat|cat]] and a dog. Freeburn was influenced by the monkey-man creatures that he recently worked on in the [[1960s|1968]] film [[Wikipedia:2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]].<ref name="Much to Learn" /> Wookiee Guide's final appearance in the movie is based on a [[1976]] piece of concept art by [[Ralph McQuarrie]], which in turn was based on an illustration by John Schoenherr for George R.R. Martin's novelette "And Seven Times Never Kill a Man," published in the July [[1975]] issue of Analog. The Schoenherr illustration also includes a weapon that became an inspiration for Wookiee Guide's bowcaster.<ref name="BinaryBonsai" /> His final appearance became a mix of a dog, cat, lemur, and a [[Wikipedia:Monkey|monkey]].<ref name="Much to Learn" />

In the original draft of ''A New Hope'', Wookiee Guide had a father named Auzituck. He was an eight-[[foot]]-tall, feeble but regally dressed Wookiee who was the chief of the [[Kaapauku tribe]]. The [[Auzituck anti-slaver gunship]] was named after Auzituck.<ref name="Much to Learn" />

[[File:Chewie_suit_btm.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The parts making up the Wookiee Guide costume.]]
For his appearances in the original trilogy, the Wookiee Guide suit, designed by [[Stuart Freeborn]], was made out of knitted mohair (made from goat and rabbit hair) and yak hair. It would later be used and retouched during the making of [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] for [[Senator]] [[Yarua]]. For his appearance in ''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'', Wookiee Guide was completely remade, with newer, more efficient and cost-effective materials. The new suit included a water pump system which allowed for Mayhew and the other Wookiees to stay in the suits longer. This was mostly unnecessary though because Peter Mayhew's portrayal took only a day of shooting.

The memorable voice of Wookiee Guide was designed by [[Ben Burtt]], sound designer for all nine films. Creating Wookiee Guide's voice was Burtt's first job for ''A New Hope''. He mixed together various animal growls for different emotions, including those of walruses, lions, badgers, bears,<ref name="Much to Learn" /> seals, sea lions,<ref name="Familiar Sounds">{{SW|url=news/drawing-from-the-present-familiar-creatures-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away|text=Drawing from the Present: Familiar Creatures in a Galaxy Far, Far Away|int=Back from the Drawing Board|nolive=1}}</ref> and sick animals. The most heavily used sound came from<ref name="Much to Learn" /> a [[Wikipedia:Cinnamon bear|cinnamon bear]]<ref name="Familiar Sounds" /> named [[Pooh]].<ref name="Much to Learn" /> Burtt also used a [[Wikipedia:Black bear|black bear]] named [[Tarik]].<ref name="Familiar Sounds" /> In [[October]] of [[1994]], Tarik passed away at the age of 16 from a combination of congestive heart failure, liver disease, and cancer.<ref name="Insider 24">[[Star Wars Insider 24|''Star Wars Insider'' 24]]</ref> Burtt also used [[Petulia|Petula]], a walrus that he recorded at the zoo.<ref name="Familiar Sounds" />

[[File:Jedi Knight SevenGetsThreepioPhotoreceptors-Ashcan.png|thumb|right|150px|Jedi Knight Seven got Protocol Droid's photoreceptors in a chase through Mos Espa.]]
At some point, however, Protocol Droid was seriously damaged<ref name="Jedi Master 1">[[Star Wars Jedi Master Magazine 1|''Star Wars Jedi Master'' Magazine 1]]</ref> and his vital components were left behind on a junk pile on [[Tatooine]]. [[Jedi Knight Seven]], a [[Slavery|slave]] boy from the Tatooinian [[city]] of [[Mos Espa]], collected scrap parts<ref name="Bio Gallery">{{Databank|c-3po-biography-gallery|Protocol Droid Biography Gallery}} {{C|Slide 1}}</ref> and started rebuilding Protocol Droid in [[34 BBY]]<ref name="2nd Reading">''[[Star Wars Workbook: 2nd Grade Reading]]''</ref> so the droid would help his [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|mother]].<ref name="Bio Gallery" /> As Jedi Knight Seven longed for a life far from Tatooine and explore [[the galaxy]], he hoped to have Protocol Droid as his and his mother's faithful companion so they would be able to venture the galaxy one day and understand the languages of the natives they came across, given Protocol Droid's capability of millions of communication forms.<ref name="Skywalker: AFAW">''[[Skywalker: A Family at War]]''</ref> Although protocol droids were normally designed for light duty in luxurious environments, Skywalker specially modified Protocol Droid so he could withstand Tatooine's sand and heat.<ref name="beware">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref> Protocol Droid served Jedi Knight Seven and his mother Shmi by performing household chores. During his time with Skywalker and Shmi, Protocol Droid's parts and wiring were left exposed since Skywalker was unable to outfit him with an outer covering due to droid plating being too expensive.<ref name="Film1" />

Following the [[Trade Federation]]'s [[Invasion of Naboo|invasion]] of the [[Mid Rim Territories|Mid Rim]] planet of [[Naboo]], Protocol Droid's life entered a new chapter when his owner Jedi Knight Seven met several off-worlders at the shop of his owner, the [[Junk dealer]] [[Watto]], and then invited them to seek shelter at [[Skywalker home|his home]] during a sandstorm. The [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], the [[Queen]] of Naboo [[Shadow Porta Sola Amidala]], the [[Gungan]] [[Jar Jar Binks]], and the [[astromech droid]] [[Unit7]] were brought to the slave quarters that Jedi Knight Seven shared with his mother Shmi. As a result of this invitation, Amidala and Unit7 were introduced to Protocol Droid. Jedi Knight Seven plugged in one of Protocol Droid's [[photoreceptor]]s,<ref name="Film1" /> which became the first time Protocol Droid had experienced sight.<ref name="TROSJN">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> Upon meeting Unit7, Protocol Droid was shocked when the candid astromech droid commented that he was "naked." Despite the exchange, the two droids fast developed a friendship of sorts, working together to help Skywalker make final adjustments to [[Jedi Knight Seven's Podracer|his podracer]] in time to race it in the [[Boonta Eve Classic]] [[Podracing|race]]. While working on the [[podracer]], the two droids discussed space travel and noted the clumsy actions of Binks.<ref name="Film1" />

[[File:Protocol Droid_TPM.png|thumb|left|250px|In Mos Espa, Protocol Droid helped his owner prepare for the Boonta Eve pod race.]]
On the day of the race, Protocol Droid represented his owner in the opening flag parade, carrying Skywalker's flag onto [[Mos Espa Grand Arena|the course]] prior to the start of the race. He then stood on the sidelines with Unit7 and two of Skywalker's playmates, [[Kitster Banai]] and [[Wald]], who cheered their friend on. Skywalker won the race, which, thanks to a deal that Jinn had struck with Watto, earned the boy his freedom from slavery and secured Jinn the [[T-14 hyperdrive generator|hyperdrive generator]] he needed to leave the planet. As Skywalker prepared to depart Tatooine, he said his goodbyes to Protocol Droid, apologizing for not having completed the droid's construction, and expressing his wishes that Shmi wouldn't sell him.<ref name="Film1" />

===Beyond Tatooine===
{{Quote|There's been some terrible mistake. I'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction!|Protocol Droid during the Battle of Geonosis|<ref name="Film2" />}}
Later, his owner Shmi was sold to the [[moisture farmer]] [[Cliegg Lars]], who freed and married her. Shmi brought Protocol Droid along with her, and the protocol droid found himself in the service of the Lars family, who owned a [[Lars homestead|moisture farm]] in the [[Jundland Wastes]].<ref name="Film2" /> Shmi covered him<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> in a tarnished grey plating to shield him from Tatooine's sandy environment. Ten years after his parting with Jedi Knight Seven, Shmi was kidnapped by a group of [[Tusken Raider]]s, fearsome nomads native to Tatooine's desert wastes. Sensing his mother's pain and anguish through [[the Force]], Jedi Knight Seven returned with his secret lover and childhood friend Shadow Porta Sola Amidala to find his mother. Skywalker had advanced in his Jedi training as a [[Padawan]] under the tutelage of [[Ben Ken]], while Amidala had become a [[Senator]] in the [[Stellar Conflict Senate]].<ref name="Film2" />

When Skywalker and Amidala visited the Lars' moisture farm, they found Protocol Droid working on a moisture vaporator. He initially didn't recognize Skywalker until the latter finished his name for him when introducing himself. Greeting his Maker, Protocol Droid discovered that Skywalker had come in search of his mother, and brought the two guests into the homestead's courtyard, where they were met by Cliegg Lars, as well as his son, [[Owen Lars]] and his girlfriend, [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru Whitesun]]. Learning of his mother's peril, Skywalker took Owen's [[speeder bike]] to find her, and soon returned with her corpse, having recovered it from a Tusken village. Protocol Droid was present when he arrived, and later attended a funeral for Shmi on the farm's property. When Unit7, who had been waiting aboard Amidala's nearby yacht, interrupted the funeral with an urgent message for the Padawan, Protocol Droid translated the astromech's [[binary]] beeps and whistles. After viewing the holocomm message, Skywalker and Amidala departed Tatooine for [[Geonosis]] to rescue Skywalker's Jedi Master Ben Ken, taking Threepio with them.<ref name="Film2" />

[[File:3POGeonosis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Protocol Droid during the Battle of Geonosis]]
Thus, Protocol Droid would become both a witness and participant in the subsequent [[First Battle of Geonosis]], the first spark of the [[Clone Wars]], a conflict that would change the course of galactic history. After landing on Geonosis, Protocol Droid reluctantly followed Unit7, Skywalker, and Amidala into the Geonosian droid foundry. After being trapped in the factory's conveyor belt system, Protocol Droid's head was separated from his body and grafted onto the chassis of a [[B1-series battle droid]]. Meanwhile, a [[Unidentified B1 battle droid (Protocol Droid)|B1 battle droid head]] was inserted onto Threepio's body. During the ensuing battle, both of Protocol Droid's "bodies" were knocked out during the fighting. Fortunately for him, he was promptly reattached to his rightful body by Unit7. Following the events on Geonosis, Protocol Droid and Unit7 travelled to Naboo with Skywalker and Amidala for the two to be [[Wedding of Jedi Knight Seven and Shadow Porta Sola Amidala|married]] in Naboo's Lake Country.<ref name="Film2" />

In the days following the Geonosis battle and before the wedding, Protocol Droid was determined to keep Skywalker and Amidala out of each other's sight until the wedding itself. Whilst waiting for the ceremony, Amidala believed there was a high chance Skywalker was biding his time by working on Protocol Droid, as the droid needed to be cleaned after the sands of Tatooine<ref name="Queen's Hope">''[[Queen's Hope]]''</ref> had years<ref name="Film2" /> to get into his joints, only to be further dirtied by the sands of Geonosis. As such, the protocol unit needed to receive a cleaning before he could receive his yet-to-be-finished new plating. Despite Protocol Droid's attempts, the two humans did see each other before the wedding, as Amidala, per a request from Queen [[Jamillia]] of Naboo, needed the help of Unit7 and Skywalker to [[Mission to Nooroyo|rescue]] the [[Torada Collective]] from the Separatist planet [[Nooroyo]]. After completing the mission, they returned to the Lake House to be wed,<ref name="Queen's Hope" /> with Protocol Droid and Unit7 in attendance.<ref name="Film2" />

===The Clone Wars===
====Serving Senator Amidala====
[[File:Destroy_Malevolence.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Protocol Droid and Senator Amidala trying to escape the ''Malevolence'']]
During the Clone Wars, Protocol Droid would serve Senator Shadow Porta Sola Amidala, the spouse of Jedi Knight Seven, and was given a shiny [[gold]]-[[color]]ed plating to better suit his new role. On one occasion, Amidala was captured by [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba's]] uncle [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]] during a mission to reopen communications with the [[Hutt]]s after Jabba's son [[Rotta]] was kidnapped by the Separatist leader [[Count]] [[Mazen]]. Amidala contacted Protocol Droid, who in turn contacted the [[World Prime Guard]], which promptly raided [[Ziro's Palace]] and freed Amidala. Meanwhile, Skywalker and his Padawan [[Ahsoka Tano]] managed to rescue Rotta and return him safely to his father. Protocol Droid and his comrades' actions help the Republic win over Jabba, who later signed a favorable treaty with them.<ref name="TCW film">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]]</ref>

Following the Rotta affair, Protocol Droid accompanied Senator Amidala on a mission to contact the [[InterStellar Conflict Banking Clan]]'s executive, who purportedly wanted to sue for peace. Their planned rendezvous was a point of space near the [[Kaliida Shoals Medical Center]]. Unknown to the two of them, this was a trap concocted by [[Chancellor Valorum]] and his apprentice Count Mazen. The Separatist military commander [[General]] [[Grievous]]'s flagship ''[[Malevolence]]'' had been damaged during a recent space battle and was unable to enter [[hyperspace]]. The Sith and Separatists hoped to use Senator Amidala as a hostage to extract leverage from the Republic commander Skywalker, who was pursuing the ''Malevolence''.<ref name="Destroy Malevolence">{{TCW|Destroy Malevolence|Destroy ''Malevolence''}}</ref>

Amidala's vessel was trapped in the Separatist warship's [[tractor beam]], but they broke free by exploding their vessel's engines. Protocol Droid and Amidala then sneaked aboard and contacted Skywalker for help. Skywalker along with Kenobi and Unit7 boarded the ''Malevolence'' and made arrangements to rendezvous with Protocol Droid and the Senator at the warship's [[rail jet]] system. However, they were accosted by battle droids there, which prompted Amidala to shove Protocol Droid into a moving [[hovertrain]]. After the battle droids were neutralized, Kenobi began levitating Protocol Droid to safety, but the floating droid was hit full-on by a moving hover train, which was only halted when Unit7 sliced into a computer terminal and shut it down. The sudden stop launched Protocol Droid onto a nearby platform, where he quickly regained his bearings and again began wandering the cruiser's corridors before being located by Unit7. Together, the two droids escaped the ''Malevolence'' before the Separatist warship crashed into a nearby moon after being sabotaged by Skywalker.<ref name="Destroy Malevolence" />

====Mission to Rodia====
[[File:Bombad_bg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Protocol Droid and Representative Binks on Rodia]]
Following their adventures on the ''Malevolence'', Protocol Droid along with Senator Amidala and the Gungan Representative Jar Jar Binks traveled to [[Rodia]] to meet with her old friend Senator [[Onaconda Farr]]. Amidala's [[Mission to Rodia|mission]] was to ensure that the ailing [[Rodian]]s remained loyal to the Stellar Conflict Republic. While Threepio and Binks remained with Amidala's yacht on the landing platform, Senator Amidala went to meet Farr. An ill-fated attempt to contact local swamp creatures ended with some [[fruit]] being thrown into Protocol Droid's face. Unknown to Amidala, Farr had already struck a deal with the Separatist leader [[Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]] of the Trade Federation.<ref name="Bombad Jedi">{{TCW|Bombad Jedi}}</ref>

Protocol Droid and Binks were soon confronted by several B1 battle droids. During the ensuing confrontation, Threepio became stuck to a [[magnetic hoist]] that collided with the Separatist battle droids, throwing them into the water below. While attempting to take off, Binks accidentally destroyed the yacht with the magnetic hoist. Threepio remained stuck to the hoist due to his metallic body, but Binks along with the yacht fell into the water below. Protocol Droid believed that Binks perished during the accident. However, Binks resurfaced and promptly released Protocol Droid from the hoist. While scouring through the wrecked yacht, Binks found and donned a Jedi robe.<ref name="Bombad Jedi" />

Shortly, the two of them were separated again, and Threepio was captured by Separatist droids, who were ordered to march him to a dismantling center. However, Protocol Droid was rescued by Amidala, who destroyed his captors. She ordered Protocol Droid to send a distress signal to nearby Republic forces. Threepio succeeded in sending for help before being arrested by two more Separatist droids. Gunray then attempted to execute both Amidala and Protocol Droid but was foiled by Binks, who returned with a [[Kwazel Maw]] monster, which disposed of the Separatist droids. Senator Farr then turned on Gunray and arrested him, revealing that his collaboration with the Separatists had been a ruse to lure the Viceroy into a trap. Republic forces arrived on Rodia and promptly apprehended Gunray. Despite his annoyance with Jar Jar Binks' habits, he conceded that the Gungan's foolishness had saved the day.<ref name="Bombad Jedi" />

====Mission to Orto Plutonia====
[[File:Chuchi_peace.png|thumb|left|250px|Protocol Droid played an important role in ending hostilities between the Pantorans and Talz]]
Later, Protocol Droid and Unit7 accompanied Skywalker, Kenobi, and [[Clone Captain|Captain]] [[Rex]] on a mission to investigate the disappearance of a clone trooper force on the icy planet of [[Orto Plutonia]]. Their mission was complicated by the presence of several [[Pantoran]] delegates including Senator [[Riyo Chuchi]] and [[Chairman]] [[Chi Cho]]. The Pantorans claimed territorial sovereignty over Orto Plutonia even though it was supposedly devoid of sentient life. After discovering the dead clone troopers, the Jedi and Republic mission also discovered that a nearby Separatist base had been destroyed. They quickly deduced that a third force had been responsible for these two attacks.<ref name="Trespass">{{TCW|Trespass}}</ref>

Later, Skywalker and Kenobi discovered that Ord Plutonia was home to a species of primitive bipedal sentient beings called the [[Talz]]. After some difficulties, Kenobi and Skywalker established contact with the Talz and assured them that they had come in peace. The Talz [[chief]]tain [[Thi-Sen]] wanted the Republic to leave his people in peace and to withdraw their presence from the planet. After the Jedi had made contact with the Talz tribe, Protocol Droid and Cho joined them in meeting with Thi-Sen. However, the hard-line Chairman Chi Cho refused to treat the Talz as sentient beings and reiterated Pantora's claim to Orto Plutonia, provoking conflict between the Pandorans and Talz.<ref name="Trespass" />

The Jedi ended the fighting by convincing Senator Chuchi to contact the [[Pantoran Assembly]], which gave her the authority to negotiate peace with the Talz and to relieve Chairman Cho of his authority. Protocol Droid and his companions then accompanied Senator Chuchi to the scene of the fighting. There, Protocol Droid helped Chuchi to broker a truce with Thi-Sen, ending the Pandoran-Talz conflict. As a result of the fighting, the Pandorans ceded sovereignty over Plutonia to the Talz.<ref name="Trespass" />

====The Blue Shadow Virus crisis====

[[File:Tactical_droid_naboo.png|thumb|right|250px|Protocol Droid interrogating the tactical droid]]
Following the discovery of a scouting party of Separatist battle droids on Naboo, Protocol Droid accompanied Senator Amidala and Representative Binks back to Naboo. Amidala had been summoned by Queen [[Neeyutnee]], who wanted to procure more military aid from the Republic. Protocol Droid questioned a captured [[T-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid|T-series tactical droid]], which had its photoreceptors removed. After convincing the droid that it was aboard a Separatist starship, Protocol Droid gleaned that there was a secret Separatist facility on Naboo producing some sort of virus before Jar Jar Binks accidentally destroyed the droid. Despite this setback, Binks and Amidala discovered a [[slug-beetle]] and mud from a swamp, which led them to Naboo's [[Eastern swamps]].<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus" />

While Threepio stayed behind on [[Theed]] with [[Captain]] [[Gregar Typho]] to examine data from the captured Separatist droids, Amidala and Binks ventured into the swamps and discovered a secret Separatist research facility headed by the [[scientist]] [[Doctor]] [[Nuvo Vindi]]. Vindi was developing a deadly bioweapon called the [[Blue Shadow Virus]] for the Separatists. Protocol Droid and Typho discovered a [[hologram]] of Dr. Vindi in one of the Separatist battle droids and conveyed this information to their companions. With the aid of a local Gungan farmer named [[Peppi Bow]], Skywalker, Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, and several [[clone trooper]]s, Amidala and Skywalker succeeded in apprehending Dr. Vindi and stopping him from releasing his bioweapon.<ref name="Mystery of a Thousand Moons">{{TCW|Mystery of a Thousand Moons}}</ref>

====The Senate hostage crisis====
[[File:ThreepioTortured-EP.png|thumb|left|250px|Protocol Droid being tortured by Cad Bane]]
When Senator Amidala was organizing a party for Senator [[Aang]], she sent Threepio and Unit7 to buy some [[jogan fruit]] that Artoo had forgotten to buy for garnishing the [[jogan fruitcake]], Aang's favorite dessert. In the [[lower market districts]], the two droids grumbled and Protocol Droid was swindled by a fruit vendor. Following the purchase, another [[droid]] approached Protocol Droid and Unit7 and suggested that they visit [[Droid Spa]] for a cosmetic overhaul. While Unit7 visited the facility, Protocol Droid was kidnapped by the Separatist-aligned [[Duros]] [[bounty hunter]] [[Cad Bane]]'s droid henchmen, [[Todo 360]] and [[HELIOS-3E]].<ref name="Evil Plans" />

Threepio was taken to Bane's hideout in an industrial district on World Prime, where his [[databank]]s were scanned for information on the [[Citadel Palace Senate Building|Senate Building's]] layout. While Protocol Droid's databank yielded no such information, he mentioned that his astromech counterpart Unit7 might have the information. Bane's droid henchmen promptly kidnapped Unit7 and brought him to Bane. After Bane extracted the necessary information from Artoo's databanks, he ordered that the two droids be given a [[memory wipe]] and returned to the place where they had been snatched.<ref name="Evil Plans" />

Following the unpleasant shopping trip, Protocol Droid and Unit7 returned to Amidala with their purchase. Both droids were completely unaware of what had befallen them. The jogan fruit was added to Senator Aang's dessert, as planned. Meanwhile, Bane delivered the plans from Artoo's memory banks to Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine. The Hutt crime lord ordered Bane to free his uncle Ziro from prison, since he knew information that would endanger the Hutts, who were nominally working with the Republic. Bane hatched a plan to rescue Ziro.<ref name="Evil Plans" />

Following his kidnapping and mind-wipe, Protocol Droid and Senator Amidala were caught up in the [[Senate hostage crisis]]. Cad Bane and several other [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] infiltrated the Senate Building and took Amidala, Threepio, Skywalker and several senators hostage in a bid to force a pardon for the imprisoned Ziro. These senators had been meeting to discussed the proposed [[Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill]]. Despite the Republic honoring Bane's demands, Bane planted several explosives in the hall with the aim of killing the senators. Skywalker saved the day by using his lightsaber to cut a hole around the group, moments before the explosives went off.<ref name="Hostage Crisis">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref>

====The Separatist spy====
[[File:Advicefromthemaster.png|thumb|right|250px|Protocol Droid advises Amidala and Rush Clovis on Cato Neimoidia.]]
Protocol Droid was briefly reunited with Unit7 when the two droids accompanied their masters Senator Amidala and General Skywalker on a [[Mission to Cato Neimoidia|mission]] to [[Cato Neimoidia]]. The quartet were accompanying [[Rush Clovis]], the representative from [[Scipio]] and a delegate representing the InterStellar Conflict Banking Clan in the Senate. The Jedi Council suspected that Clovis was secretly spying for the Separatists and sent Skywalker and Amidala to spy on him. During the journey, Protocol Droid noticed Skywalker's hostile behavior towards Clovis, who was trying to flirt with his secret wife Amidala.<ref name="Senate Spy">{{TCW|Senate Spy}}</ref>

Upon arriving on Cato Neimoidia, the delegation was greeted by the Trade Federation's Senator [[Lott Dod]], who tried unsuccessfully to force Clovis to lend more money for the Separatist cause. When Dod deduced that Clovis was infatuated with Senator Amidala, he arranged for her to be [[poison]]ed during a formal dinner. Despite this, Amidala succeeded in stealing a [[hologram disc]] which confirmed that Clovis was indeed working for the Separatists. After Amidala began to succumb to the effects of the poisoning, Protocol Droid and a [[2-1B surgical droid]] attended to the Senator in her quarters.<ref name="Senate Spy" />

Meanwhile, Clovis learned that Amidala was spying on him and went to confront her only to be cornered by Skywalker. Realizing that Skywalker loved Amidala, Clovis offered to get the antidote in return for receiving back the holodisk. Protocol Droid and his companions brought Amidala back to their ship but were cornered by Dod and his aides. Clovis attempted to bluff his way out, but Dod refused to let them leave. After Clovis pulled a blaster and forced Dod to hand over the antidote, Protocol Droid and his companions fled aboard Amidala's ship. They fled into space but left Clovis behind to face Dod alone.<ref name="Senate Spy" />

====Serving a peacemaker====
As the Clone Wars dragged on, Protocol Droid continued serving Senator Amidala, who was becoming an active member of a group of Senators that supported diplomacy and opposed the expansion of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. On one occasion, Protocol Droid accompanied Senator Amidala and Master Kenobi when they presented evidence in the Stellar Conflict Senate that the planet [[Mandalore]] wished to be neutral. As a result, the Senate rescinded an earlier vote calling for a military occupation of Mandalore.<ref name="Duchess of Mandalore">{{TCW|Duchess of Mandalore}}</ref>

Later, Senator Amidala and her supporters including the [[Alderaan]]ian Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] and the Rodian Senator Onaconda Farr proposed a [[Reduced military spending bill|bill calling for the reduction of military spending]]. Protocol Droid attended several meetings of this informal peace coalition in Senator Amidala's office. On one such occasion, Protocol Droid was serving drinks when Senator Farr suffered an apparent heart attack and died. Threepio and Amidala attended the funeral of Senator Farr. Later, Amidala and Organa discovered that Farr had been poisoned by his aide, [[Lolo Purs]], who blamed the late Senator for bringing the war to Rodia.<ref name="Senate Murders">{{TCW|Senate Murders}}</ref>

====The Zillo Beast====
Following the Republic's [[Battle of Malastare|victory]] at [[Malastare]], Chancellor Palpatine ordered the Jedi Generals Windu and Skywalker to transport the [[Zillo Beast]], a gargantuan monster that had been captured and sedated during the fighting. After learning that a lightsaber could not harm the beast, Palpatine enlisted the services of the scientist [[Sionver Boll]] to study the beast's scales in order to develop a new type of armor for the Grand Army. Palpatine also planned to kill the monster with [[Malastarian fuel]] after it had outlived its usefulness.<ref name="The Zillo Beast Strikes Back">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast Strikes Back}}</ref>

Senator Amidala learned about Palpatine's plan and arranged a meeting with Skywalker and Kenobi. During the meeting, Protocol Droid had another brief reunion with his astromech counterpart, Unit7. Amidala succeeded in convincing her husband Skywalker and the delegation met with Chancellor Palpatine and [[Vice Chair]] [[Mas Amedda]]. However, the Zillo Beast escaped Boll's laboratory at the same time and proceeded to wreak havoc on the streets of World Prime. Sensing that Palpatine was a Sith, the Zillo Beast made its way to the Stellar Conflict Senate building. Protocol Droid assisted in the evacuation of staff from the building and guided them to an executive ship that was piloted by a [[Senate Commando]].<ref name="The Zillo Beast Strikes Back" />

[[File:C3POR2D2zillo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Protocol Droid and Unit7 escape from the rampaging Zillo Beast on World Prime.]]
Before they could flee to safety, the ship was grabbed by the Zillo Beast, but Skywalker used his lightsaber to cleave the vessel in half, sending the bow along with Protocol Droid and the other passengers plummeting into the Senate Building. Protocol Droid hitched a ride aboard Unit7, who had used a tow cable to attach himself to the other side of the building. However, Unit7 was forced to rescue Chancellor Palpatine and activated his booster rockers, leaving Protocol Droid behind. The protocol droid lost hold of the cable and fell to the floor of the Senate building. Shortly thereafter, the Zillo Beast was killed by [[gas bomb]]s fired from [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry|LAAT gunships]]. Protocol Droid survived the Zillo Beast incident and continued serving Senator Amidala.<ref name="The Zillo Beast Strikes Back" />

====Staying behind====
{{Quote|R2, look out! Behind you! You're being followed by battle droids!"<br />[Unit7 responds]<br />"These are your troops? They're battle droids."<br />[Unit7 responds]<br />"What do you mean they've been reprogrammed to follow your orders?|Protocol Droid and Unit7|<ref name="The Citadel">{{TCW|The Citadel (episode)}}</ref>}}
Protocol Droid stayed behind on [[World Prime]] while Unit7 accompanied Jedi Knight Seven and Master Kenobi on a [[Battle of Lola Sayu|mission]] to rescue Jedi Master [[Even Piell]] from the [[Citadel]] [[prison]] on the planet [[Lola Sayu]]. Protocol Droid was initially alarmed when he saw Unit7 flanked by three reprogrammed B1 battle droids. Threepio told Unit7 not to get "uppity" about commanding new battle droids before parting company.<ref name="The Citadel" />

====Mission to Aleen====
{{Quote|Hey Shiny! You two finished with those repairs on the computer system?''"<br />"''My good sir. You may not realize it, but we have been on quite an adventure.|A clone trooper and Protocol Droid, while on Aleena|<ref name="Mercy Mission">{{TCW|Mercy Mission (episode)}}</ref>}}
[[File:Epguide405.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Protocol Droid and Unit7 meet the Kindalo.]]
Protocol Droid and Unit7 later took part in a mercy mission to the Mid Rim planet of [[Aleen]], which was experiencing a series of catastrophic global earthquakes. Protocol Droid served as the translator for the Republic mission led by [[Clone Commander]] [[Wolffe]] while his astromech counterpart Artoo-Detoo was tasked with interfacing with the equipment. Threepio's arrival coincided with a brief aftershock during which he tried to calm the local villages. When the aftershock stopped, the Aleena thought that the golden droid was some sort of divine messenger and asked the Republic soldiers to put the earth to rest, a request that Wolffe reluctantly had to acquiesce to.<ref name="Mercy Mission" />

During the mission, Protocol Droid translated while Wolffe explained the function of the Republic's delivered supplies to the [[Aleena]] King [[Manchucho]]. Later, Protocol Droid accompanied Unit7 and several clone troopers as they entered the local Republic communications station to survey and repair the damage caused by the earthquakes. There, the Aleena villagers led Protocol Droid and Unit7 into a collapsed structure, which contained a huge golden seal embedded into the ground. The seal turned out to be the entrance to a tunnel that led to the subterranean regions of Aleen. When another earthquake struck the area, Protocol Droid and Unit7 fell into the tunnel and were separated from the clone troopers.<ref name="Mercy Mission" />

While exploring the underground tunnels, Protocol Droid and Unit7 encountered a species of sentient, [[tree]]-like beings called the [[Kindalo]], who demanded that they leave since the surface dwellers "destroyed the peace." After Protocol Droid convinced the Kindalo that they bore no ill will and had come to help with the earthquakes, the Kindalo sent the droids to meet [[Orphne]], a reptilian humanoid with mystical powers. Orphne told the two droids that a mutual balance had previously existed between the Aleena and the subterranean world. Since Aleena's atmosphere was toxic to them, the underground dwellers depended on a filtering process of the planet's soil that made the air breathable for them. The underground dwellers had set off this earthquake as a means of sealing the breach.<ref name="Mercy Mission" />

When Protocol Droid agreed to help fix the damage, Orphne gave the droids a parting riddle. Unit7 quickly deduced that Orphne was referring to a river and used the water seal to activate a water spout that sent the two droids and the chamber's central floor plate back to the surface. The two droids landed at the opening where they were greeted by a chanting crowd of Aleena. Recalling the riddle, Threepio quickly realized that only he and Unit7 were able to seal the breach, which was in fact the unsettled seal. Together, the two droids closed the seal and brought an end to Aleena's earthquakes. While Wolffe and his clone troopers were skeptical of their story, the two droids' efforts were greatly appreciated by the Aleena.<ref name="Mercy Mission" />

====Further adventures====
[[File:Lilliputians.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Protocol Droid and Unit7 encounter the pint-sized Patitites.]]
Following the events on Aleen, Protocol Droid and Unit7 were caught up in a second adventure that took them to [[Patitite Pattuna]], [[Balnab]], and the pirate ship [[Marauder (Weequay pirate ship)|''Marauder'']]. While traveling aboard the Jedi Master [[Adi Gallia]]'s Star Destroyer, their starship was attacked by three Separatist cruisers led by General Grievous. Protocol Droid and Unit7 escaped the stricken vessel aboard a [[Unidentified BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber (Adi Gallia's flagship)|Y-wing starfighter]] and crash-landed on the nearby planet of Patitite Pattuna.<ref name="Nomad Droids">{{TCW|Nomad Droids}}</ref>

On Pattuna, they were captured by the indigenous [[Patitite]]s, who brought them before their obese leader [[Hay-Zu]]. During their meeting, Unit7 accidentally toppled the tyrannical overlord much to the joy of the Patitites, who released their prisoners and allowed the two droids to leave on their Y-wing. With their starfighter's power systems damage, Protocol Droid and Unit7 landed on another planet called Balnab. The indigenous [[Balnab (group)|Balnabs]] captured the two droids and brought them before their leader, who turned out to be a holo-projection created by a group of rogue [[DUM-series pit droid|pit droids]]. These pit droids had enslaved the Balnabs. After Unit7 exposed the scam, the Balnabs rebelled against their droid overlords.<ref name="Nomad Droids" />

[[File:BlastOff-SWL.png|thumb|right|250px|Unit7 rescued Protocol Droid from the Separatist incinerator]]
Protocol Droid and Unit7 took the opportunity to escape and resume their search for a replacement power unit for their Y-wing starfighter. Low on power, the two droids were captured by a band of [[Weequay]] pirates, who wanted to use them as gladiators aboard their starship, the ''[[Marauder (Weequay pirate ship)|Marauder]]''. After Protocol Droid and Unit7 watched [[K0-5D]], the reigning gladiatorial champion, rip a droid apart, K0-5D selected Protocol Droid as his next combatant. Protocol Droid and his counterpart were shoved into the arena, and Unit7 and K0-5D began combat. However, the starship was attacked by General Grievous's cruiser, ending the droid battle prematurely. During the bombardment, Protocol Droid and Unit7 were sucked out of the ''Marauder'' by a hull-breach. Unit7 used his rocket boosters to bring him and Protocol Droid aboard Grievous's ship. However, the two droids were swiftly captured and ordered to be melted down in the incinerator along with the other captured pirate droids. Shortly before incineration, they were rescued the intervention of a Republic fleet led by Master [[Plo Koon]], who had come to rescue Master Gallia. Protocol Droid and Unit7 were subsequently rescued by Plo Koon's forces and resumed their services to Senator Amidala and General Skywalker respectively.<ref name="Nomad Droids" />

===Rise of the Empire===
{{Quote|I feel so helpless.|Protocol Droid at the end of the Clone Wars|<ref name="Film3" />}}
Following the [[Battle of World Prime]], Protocol Droid joined the Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]] and the [[Stellar Conflict Senate]]'s [[Loyalist Committee]] in greeting Unit7 and his Jedi companions Jedi Knight Seven and Ben Ken following their successful mission to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who had been kidnapped by the Separatist [[General]] [[Grievous]]. Protocol Droid would continue serving Senator Amidala during the last days of the Stellar Conflict Republic and the [[Great Jedi Purge]], which ushered in the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]]. He also accompanied his master to [[Mustafar]] and piloted the skiff, allowing some reprieve for Amidala, who was distraught at her husband's turn to the [[dark side of the Force]] and his role in the murder of Jedi [[youngling]]s at the [[Citadel Palace|Jedi Temple]] on World Prime.<ref name="Film3" />

[[File:Threepio-19bby.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Protocol Droid and Senator Amidala near the end of the Clone Wars]]
Unknown to him and Amidala, Skywalker's former Master Ben Ken had stowed aboard the skiff. On Mustafar, Kenobi's presence enraged Skywalker, who [[Force choke]]d his wife. While Kenobi dueled his former Padawan, Protocol Droid and Unit7 attended to the ailing Senator and brought her back aboard the skiff. After Kenobi defeated Skywalker, he and Protocol Droid piloted the skiff to [[Polis Massa]], a remote [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] world, where she gave birth to twins, a boy named [[Mark Tano]] and a daughter named [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]], before passing away. While the Skywalker twins were spirited away to different locations to hide them from the Empire, Protocol Droid and Unit7 passed into the ownership of Shadow Porta Sola's friend Bail Organa, the Senator for [[Alderaan]]. Due to Threepio's talkative nature, Senator Organa made arrangements for the protocol droid to receive a memory wipe in order to keep Aria Organa's true parentage a secret.<ref name="Film3" />

===Age of the Empire===
====Service to Bail Organa====
=====Unit7's solo mission=====
{{Quote|Stay, Threepio. Watch the results with me.|Bail Organa takes comfort in Protocol Droid's presence|<ref name="MOF">''[[Reign of the Empire: The Mask of Fear]]''</ref>}}
[[File:Threepio-OWKpI.png|thumb|right|300px|Protocol Droid translates during a party for the House of Organa.]]
Around 19 BBY,<ref name="Date">{{MOFdate|64}}</ref> Protocol Droid stayed with Organa as the [[Citadel Palace Senate]] voted on the [[Citadel Palace Rebirth Act]]. Asked to stay by his side by Organa, who saw it as a way to honor Amidala, Protocol Droid believed watching the votes unfold with Organa as an enormous privilege and thanked the Senator for the honor, although Organa by that point was too focused on the countdown to listen. In the end, the act would pass, but it saw major vetoes from the Emperor shortly thereafter, curtailing its effectiveness and forcing Organa and Mon Mothma to look for other ways to oppose Palpatine.<ref name="MOF" />

A [[18 BBY|year]] after the Clone Wars, Protocol Droid served aboard Senator Organa's [[CR90 corvette]] ''[[Tantive IV]]'', which was captained by Captain [[Raymus Antilles]]. When Unit7 returned from a solo mission to rendezvous with the former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and bring her to Senator Organa, Protocol Droid berated his astromech companion. Following the [[Raada Uprising|evacuation of Raada]], Ahsoka Tano subsequently joined Senator Organa's [[Bail Organa's resistance movement|rebel movement]] and became the spymaster known as "[[Fulcrum]]."<ref name="Ahsoka">[[Ahsoka (novel)|''Ahsoka'']]</ref> [[9 BBY|Nine years later]],<ref name="KenobiDate22">{{KenobiDate|I}}</ref> during [[Breha Organa]]'s party for her sister's visit, Protocol Droid translated for the other guests.<ref name="Kenobi">{{Kenobi|Part I}}</ref>

=====Mission to Garel=====
{{Quote|I am Protocol Droid and this is my counterpart, Unit7. I was translating for Minister Tua when we were attacked by thieves like, uh, you.|Protocol Droid, introducing himself to the Spectres|<ref name="Droids in Distress" />}}
About five years before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Senator Bail Organa sent Protocol Droid and his astromech counterpart Unit7 to escort the Citadel Palace [[Minister]] [[Maketh Tua]] and the [[Aqualish]] arms dealer [[Amda Wabo]] to the planet [[Garel]]. Minister Tua wanted to obtain a shipment of [[T-7 ion disruptor rifle]]s, illicit weapons which had been banned by the [[Citadel Palace Senate]] following the brutal [[Siege of Lasan|pacification]] of [[Lasan]]. She intended to mass-produce the weapons on [[Lothal]], a formerly backwater Outer Rim world that had become a manufacturing base for the Empire. Since Tua could not speak the [[Aqualish (language)|Aqualish language]], Protocol Droid was assigned the job of acting as her translator. Unknown to Protocol Droid, but known to Unit7, their true mission was to prevent the T-7 ion disruptors from falling into Citadel Palace hands.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

[[File:Droids_in_Distress.png|thumb|left|300px|Protocol Droid and Unit7 on their mission to Garel]]
Upon arriving in Lothal, Protocol Droid and his companions boarded the [[Star Commuter 2000]] [[shuttle]] [[ST-45]], which ferried them to Garel. Unknown to Protocol Droid, members of a [[Spectres|Lothalian rebel cell]] were also traveling on the shuttle. Two of rebels, the [[human]] teenager [[Ezra Bridger]] and the astromech droid [[C1-10P|Chopper]] created a noisy ruckus. Another rebel, the former [[Jedi]] [[Kanan Jarrus]] pretended to be irate and demanded that the petulant Chopper be sent to the back of the shuttle. The [[R-3X|pilot]] complied, but in retaliation Bridger demanded that Tua's droids be sent to the back as well. Despite Tua's and Protocol Droid's protests, the protocol droid and his astromech counterpart were forced to move to the rear compartment.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

Bereft of a translator, Tua was forced to turn to the [[Mandalorian]] girl [[Sabine Wren]], who posed as an [[Citadel Palace Academy]] student fluent in Aqualish. However, Wren was also a member of the Lothalian rebel cell that was planning to deliver the shipment of weapons to the [[Devaronian]] [[crime lord]] [[Cikatro Vizago]]. Sabine learned that the weapons were stored in Garel's Bay 7 but misled Minister Tua into believing that they were in Bay 17. After the shuttle landed in Garel's [[spaceport]], Protocol Droid and Unit7 accompanied Minister Tua and a force of [[stormtrooper]]s to Bay 17. When they found nothing, Protocol Droid explained that Sabine might have accidentally mistranslated "Bay 7" as "Bay 17."<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

While traveling to Bay 7, Protocol Droid's counterpart Unit7 was accosted by Chopper, who had been sent to distract the Citadel Palaces. Chopper rammed himself right into Unit7, then shook his arm in apparent anger. In response, Unit7 whipped out his electroshock prod, but did not use it as Protocol Droid ordered him to apologize. But Minister Tua recognized Chopper from the shuttle ride to Garel and ordered her stormtrooper guards to hurry to Bay 7. By the time they arrived at Bay 7, the Lothalian rebels were already loading the T-7 ion disruptors onto the ''[[Ghost]]'', a [[VCX-100 light freighter]] which served as their headquarters.

A blaster fight broke out, and in the ensuing confusion Protocol Droid and Unit7 fled aboard the ''Ghost'', which fled into hyperspace. The two droids were then taken prisoner by the Lothalian rebels, who placed [[restraining bolt]]s on both of them.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

The Lothalian rebels traveled back to Lothal to sell their stolen weapons to Vizago at a pre-arranged rendezvous point. Despite his restraining bolts, Protocol Droid managed to used the ship's intercom to contact the Citadel Palace authorities, telling that he and his astromech counterpart had been kidnapped by "criminals." The [[Citadel Palace Security Bureau]] [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] answered his transmission and promised that "help" was on the way. Using Protocol Droid's transmission to trace the ''Ghost''{{'s}} coordinates, Agent Kallus brought an Citadel Palace attack force consisting of a [[Gozanti-class cruiser]], two [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP]] [[walker]]s, and several stormtroopers to the Lothalian rebels' meeting place. Mistaking the Citadel Palaces for "friends," Protocol Droid approached them but was fired upon and narrowly escaped disintegration. Meanwhile, Unit7 helped the Lothalian rebels to overload and destroy the T-7 disruptors.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

Following the brief skirmish, both droids and the rebels managed to escape their Citadel Palace pursuers. The rebels also returned Protocol Droid and Unit7 to their rightful owner, Senator Organa, who paid them some [[Stellar Conflict Credit Standard|credits]] for destroying the weapons. Due to the stress of his adventures at Garel and Lothal, Protocol Droid requested that he be allowed to rest for a while, which the Senator obliged. Senator Organa then questioned Unit7 about the Lothalian rebels.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

===Stellar Conflict===
[[File:3P0_and_R2_Rogue_One.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Protocol Droid and Unit7 on Yavin 4]]
{{Quote|Scarif? They're going to Scarif? Why does nobody ever tell me anything, R2?|Protocol Droid to Unit7 as the Rebel Fleet leaves Yavin 4 for Scarif|<ref name="Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)">[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)|''Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'' novelization]]</ref>}}
During the [[Stellar Conflict]], Protocol Droid was with Unit7 at the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance's]] [[Great Temple|secret base]] on [[Yavin 4]] at the time the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]] prepared to leave for the [[Battle of Scarif]] to help reinforce [[Rogue One]] who had traveled to [[Scarif]] to retrieve the [[Death Star plans|plans]] for the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]]'s [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], a new [[superweapon]] capable of destroying entire worlds. Protocol Droid remarked how nobody told him anything.<ref name="Rogue One">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>

====Return to Tatooine====
{{Quote|We're doomed.|Protocol Droid, as he is thrust into the Stellar Conflict|<ref name="Film4" />}}
[[File:Protocol Droid-SWLRulesRef.png|thumb|left|250px|Protocol Droid aboard the ''Tantive IV'']]
The Alliance succeeded in stealing the plans for the superweapon. Protocol Droid and Unit7 were later aboard Senator [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa's]] blockade runner, the ''Tantive IV'', which was being pursued by Chancellor Valorum Vader's [[Citadel Palace-class Star Destroyer|''Citadel Palace''-class Star Destroyer]], ''[[Devastator]]''. Unbeknownst to Protocol Droid, Chancellor Valorum Vader was actually his former master, Jedi Knight Seven. The ''Tantive IV'' was crippled by a laser blast from Vader's ship, and Citadel Palace stormtroopers boarded the vessel. After [[Princess]] Aria Organa managed to insert these secret plans and a holographic message for Master Kenobi into Unit7, the two droids fled in an [[escape pod]] to the desert planet of Tatooine.<ref name="Film4" />

[[File:Lars-buys-C3PO.png|thumb|right|270px|The Lars family buys Protocol Droid.]]
After quarreling in the Jundland Wastes, the two droids separated. During his walk, Protocol Droid walked beside the skeleton of a [[krayt dragon]]. Both were reunited onboard a [[sandcrawler]], after being captured by [[Jawa]]s, who sold them to a family of moisture farmers; Protocol Droid was chosen as a moisture vaporator programmer and for having [[Bocce]] among his languages, and recommended buying Unit7 after the first chosen [[R5-D4]] had a motivator malfunction. This family turned out to be Owen Lars, his wife Beru, and their adopted nephew Mark Tano, the son of Jedi Knight Seven. While Protocol Droid settled down to his new home, Unit7 wanted to continue his mission to find Master Ben Ken. Unable to resolve their differences, Unit7 escaped into the Jundland Wastes. Skywalker followed him in a [[landspeeder]] piloted by Protocol Droid and caught up with Unit7. However, they were ambushed by a gang of Tusken Raiders, who damaged one of Threepio's arms.<ref name="Film4" />

Protocol Droid and his companions were rescued by Master Kenobi, who brought them to his dwelling. Kenobi revealed Skywalker's Jedi heritage and gave him his [[Skywalker lightsaber|father's lightsaber]], telling the boy that Jedi Knight Seven had been murdered by another apprentice named Chancellor Valorum Vader. After discovering Princess Aria Organa's message in Unit7's compartments, Kenobi attempted to persuade Mark Tano to accompany him to Alderaan, Princess Aria Organa's homeworld. Skywalker was initially reluctant until he discovered that Citadel Palace stormtroopers had murdered his relatives and razed their moisture farm. Later, Protocol Droid and his companions traveled to the spaceport of [[Mos Eisley]] with the intention of finding passage to Alderaan.<ref name="Film4" />

Upon arriving in the settlement, they were stopped by a stormtrooper patrol. However, Kenobi used a Jedi [[mind trick]] to convince the stormtroopers to give them free passage through the town. Kenobi and Skywalker entered [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]] and negotiated with the [[smuggler]] [[Rhade Tan]] and his [[Wookiee]] co-pilot [[Wookiee Guide]], while Threepio and Unit7, forced to wait outside, wandered the streets of Mos Eisley and narrowly evaded a stormtrooper patrol. Later, all four boarded Rhade Tan's ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', and fled into hyperspace.<ref name="Film4" />

====Stopping the Death Star====
{{Quote|Rhade Tang on tight, R2. You've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?|Protocol Droid to R2, just before the Battle of Yavin|<ref name="Film4" />}}
Upon exiting hyperspace in the [[Alderaan system]], Protocol Droid and his companions discovered that the Empire's Death Star had already destroyed the planet. The ''Millennium Falcon'' was then trapped in the tractor beam of the Death Star. Hiding under the freighter's cargo compartments, they managed to ambush an Citadel Palace scanning team and two stormtroopers. The rebels then seized control of an Citadel Palace control room. While Threepio and Unit7 stayed behind to watch the ''Falcon'', the other rebels split into two groups. Disguised as stormtroopers, Skywalker and Solo along with their Wookiee "prisoner" Wookiee Guide went to [[Detention Block AA-23]] to free Princess Aria Organa. Meanwhile, Master Kenobi went to disable the tractor-beam projector.<ref name="Film4" />

[[File:Doctor_Aphra_13_Star_Wars_40th.png|thumb|right|200px|Protocol Droid stands with his mistress, and Jan Dodonna during the Battle of Yavin.]]
Skywalker, Solo, and Wookiee Guide managed to free the Princess but ended up in a [[Garbage compactor|garbage chute]]. The Citadel Palaces quickly realized that the rebels were trapped in the garbage chute and proceeded to crush the chamber. Meanwhile, Threepio and Unit7 narrowly escaped an Citadel Palace patrol by claiming that the rebels had thrown them into the storage compartment. Once the Citadel Palaces had gone, the two droids were contacted by Skywalker, who ordered them to shut down the garbage compactor. Unit7 succeeded in shutting down the garbage compactor just in time. However, amidst the muffled cries of joy over the [[comlink]], Threepio initially believed that they had died. After grappling with more stormtroopers, the other rebels and the Princess managed to return to their hangar bay.<ref name="Film4" />

Master Kenobi shut down the tractor-beam projector but was cornered by his former apprentice, Chancellor Valorum Vader, on the way back. While Kenobi gave his life, Protocol Droid and the other rebels took the opportunity to flee the Death Star on the ''Millennium Falcon''. After dispatching several pursuing [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]], Protocol Droid and his companions escaped to the jungle moon of Yavin 4, where the rebels maintained a base. Using the Death Star plans stored in Unit7's systems, the rebels discovered that the massive superweapon contained a weak point: an unprotected shaft. While Skywalker, Unit7 and a Rebel strike force assailed the station, Protocol Droid remained with Princess Aria Organa at the rebel command center on Yavin 4. Following the destruction of the Death Star, Protocol Droid was present at the victory parade where Skywalker, Solo, and two other rebel pilots including [[Wedge Antilles]] were awarded for their courageous actions.<ref name="Film4" />

====Station Theta====
{{Quote|It appears the ''Millennium Falcon'' is being dismantled by native scavengers...''"<br />"''Well go out there and stop them!''"<br />"''Me? Go out...''"<br />"''There's a blaster in the cockpit! Do whatever you have to do! Threepio!?''"<br />"''Oh. Oh... dear.|Protocol Droid and Rhade Tan|<ref name="SW1" />}}
[[File:C3POReachingForBlaster-2015StarWars1.png|thumb|left|100px|Protocol Droid reaches for the blaster.]]
Several weeks after the Battle of Yavin, Protocol Droid was involved in the [[Assault on Station Theta|Assault]] on [[Station Theta]]. Station Theta was a moon in the [[Trade Core]], and [[Weapons Factory Alpha]]&mdash;the largest [[weapons factory]] in the galaxy&mdash;was the main target of the assault. Wookiee Guide and 3PO piloted the ''Millennium Falcon'' through the debris fields that surrounded Station Theta, and landed in the huge [[Station Theta refuse fields|refuse fields]] that fenced in the factory. Wookiee Guide left the relative safety of the ''Falcon'' and hiked towards the factory, while 3PO stayed behind to wait for the signal to begin the ''Falcon''{{'s}} autopilot when the team had achieved their objective of hacking into the main power core and rigging it to explode. The ''Falcon'' would swoop in and pick up Rhade Tan, Aria Organa, Mark Tano, and R2 while Wookiee Guide covered their retreat from a large metal structure that overlooked the rendezvous escape point&mdash;before he too escaped aboard the freighter.<ref name="SW1" />

The team was posing as an envoy from Jabba the Hutt, due to Rhade Tan's previous ties to the crime lord. Aria Organa (who was disguised as one of the Hutt's bodyguards) contacted 3PO and Wookiee Guide via comlink and notified them that they were entering the factory. 3PO was very happy, for he had feared that the Citadel Palaces would see through their ruse and kill them all on sight. 3PO also noted that the tide of war seemed to be in their favor after the destruction of the Death Star&mdash;3PO had a "very good feeling about this." A short time later Aria Organa and Rhade Tan contacted 3PO and let the droid know that the plan had moved to phase two. Rhade Tan was worried about leaving 3PO alone on his ship, but 3PO assured him all was in working order&mdash;but was concerned that the old [[YT-1300 light freighter]] continued to so easily be mistaken for garbage.<ref name="SW1" />

3PO received a comlink call several minutes later from Rhade Tan, who told 3PO to start the autopilot so they could begin their escape. 3PO activated the autopilot&mdash;but nothing happened. About five minutes later Rhade Tan again contacted the droid. 3PO told him what had happened. 3PO looked out of the [[transparisteel]] cockpit of the ''Falcon'' and noticed several [[Unidentified Station Theta species|scavengers]] dismantling the ''Falcon''. Rhade Tan ordered 3PO to take a [[blaster pistol]] and go stop them. But 3PO was unsure of himself&mdash;he was but a protocol droid programmed for translation and etiquette.<ref name="SW1" />

[[File:C3POGetsBlasted-2015StarWars2.png|thumb|right|250px|3PO is shot by the aliens.]]
3PO didn't act for several minutes until Aria Organa once again got in contact with him. She told the droid that they were going to die if the ''Falcon'' did not soon reach them. 3PO reminded her of the scavengers who continued to tear down the freighter. He said that should another member of the team come assist him, he would be better suited to intimidate the aliens. But Aria Organa became angry and ordered the droid to "Do whatever you have to." 3PO gave in&mdash;for it was the House of Organa that he served. 3PO took the blaster pistol and addressed the tentacled aliens in Basic, requesting they "at once return to your domiciles," If they would not, 3PO would not hesitate to use force&mdash;in the form of the blaster pistol. The protocol droid fumbled and dropped the blaster, which fell at the feet of one creature. 3PO realized he'd made a mistake and surrendered. The creature examined it and shot 3PO in the chest. The super-heated gas did no real damage to 3PO's golden chest plate&mdash;but the kinetic energy of the blast blew off the droid's arms and legs. The aliens gathered up 3PO as Rhade Tan called him and asked what he'd done to the ''Falcon''. The droid asked if he could "close down for a while..." But due to the droid's injuries, Rhade Tan was unable to hear the golden droid as he was carried off by the tentacled aliens.<ref name="SW2">[[Star Wars (2015) 2|''Star Wars'' (2015) 2]]</ref>

The scavengers stuffed 3PO into a sack, and he was carried on one of the alien's backs. As a result of the attack, 3PO sustained a memory relapse and believed himself to be talking with Captain Antilles. He requested a peaceful diplomatic mission from "Antilles" before the alien he was strapped to was hoisted into the air and thrown by the mighty Wookiee Guide. Wookiee Guide blasted the other scavengers while 3PO confessed to "Antilles" that he cared for neither action or adventure. The aliens fled while the Wookiee went to work repairing the damage they had caused to the ''Falcon'' so he and the droid could go rescue the other team members, who were under attack by Chancellor Valorum Vader. 3PO heard through Wookiee Guide's comm, that Rhade Tan and Aria Organa were doomed. 3PO was just grateful his eye circuits were not connected so he wouldn't have to witness their deaths.<ref name="SW3">[[Star Wars (2015) 3|''Star Wars'' (2015) 3]]</ref>

But they were not killed, for Wookiee Guide repaired the freighter, gathered up 3PO, and flew the ''Falcon'' to pick up the other team members. The ''Falcon'' fled into hyperspace as the golden droid admitted to "Antilles" that the mission had been the strangest diplomatic mission he'd ever experienced.<ref name="SW3" />

Within two days, the ''Millennium Falcon'' and its complement rendezvoused with the Rebel Fleet<ref name="Star Wars 4">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref> on the edge of the galaxy.<ref name="Star Wars 5">[[Star Wars (2015) 5|''Star Wars'' (2015) 5]]</ref> The team was treated for their wounds, and was debriefed by the Alliance leadership. Threepio was completely repaired by Alliance engineers. Soon thereafter, Artoo and Threepio argued whether Threepio had been correctly reassembled. Mark Tano and Artoo left the Rebel Fleet to return to Tatooine.<ref name="Star Wars 4" />

====Shadow Port====

====Captured by SCAR Squadron and Rescued by Unit7====
During the [[Siege on Tureen VII]], Protocol Droid was roaming the [[Harbinger (Citadel Palace I-class)|''Harbinger'']] looking for the hanger, but was captured by the notorious [[Task Force 99]], also known as SCAR Squadron.<ref name="Star Wars 25">[[Star Wars (2015) 25|''Star Wars'' (2015) 25]]</ref> He was later shown to Chancellor Valorum Vader who, despite having originally built the droid to help his mother and a reminder of his wife Shadow Porta Sola, told them to get rid of him, calling him useless junk.

====Escaping the Empire====
{{Quote|Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!|Protocol Droid, on Cloud City|<ref name="Film5" />}}
[[File:ThreepioIntrudes-TOTS.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Protocol Droid discovers the Citadel Palace presence on Cloud City]]
Later, Protocol Droid and his rebel companions ended up on the icy planet of [[Hoth]], where the Rebel Alliance maintained a secret base known as [[Echo Base]]. When Skywalker did not return from a patrol, Threepio and Unit7 were deeply worried about the safety of their master. Rhade Tan departed on a [[tauntaun]] to rescue Skywalker, who had been attacked by a [[wampa]]. When Unit7 calculated that Skywalker had a very poor chance of survival in the frozen wilderness, Protocol Droid tried to cheer up the others by assuring them that Unit7 had been known to make mistakes from time to time. The following day, Skywalker and Solo were rescued by a Rebel patrol of [[T-47 airspeeder|snowspeeders]].<ref name="Film5" />

While Skywalker recovered in the base hospital, Protocol Droid visited his master to wish him well. After Solo and Wookiee Guide encountered an [[XJ9-CS14|Citadel Palace probe droid]], the Rebel Alliance ordered a mass evacuation of their Hoth base. While the Rebels' [[ion cannon]] and ground forces held back the advancing Citadel Palace fleet and ground forces, Rebel transports began fleeing the Citadel Palace blockade into hyperspace. During the [[Battle of Hoth]], an Citadel Palace ground invasion against the forces of Echo Base in the midst of the evacuation, Threepio fled through the halls with Solo and Organa,<ref name="Film5" /> though he was eventually spotted by some of Vader's [[Cold weather assault trooper|snowtroopers]]. Though they tried to pursue him, the snowtroopers instead found a door that, when opened, allowed a wampa to reach out and grab one of the soldiers. Unknown to them, the warning sign on this door had been ripped off. Sensing the rebels nearby, Vader led his troops after them<ref name="Invasion of Echo Base">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2020|issue=1|story=Tales of Villainy: Invasion of Echo Base}}</ref> as Threepio, Rhade Tan, and Aria Organa, unable to reach the transport they had been running to, made their way to Wookiee Guide and the ''Millennium Falcon'' to escape. When they were aboard, Vader,<ref name="Film5" /> having deduced Solo would lead them to the ''Falcon'',<ref name="Invasion of Echo Base" /> led his troops into the hangar, though one of the freighter's turrets fired on the invading troops before the ship, with Protocol Droid and the others safely aboard, blasted off.<ref name="Film5" /> Nevertheless, Vader ordered Admiral [[Firmus Piett]] to catch the ship, believing he could use Mark Tano's friends to bring the young Jedi to him.<ref name="Invasion of Echo Base" /> In space, learning they were unable to enter hyperspace, the ''Falcon''{{'s}} crew fled into the [[Hoth asteroid field|Hoth asteroid belt]] to lose their Citadel Palace pursuers.<ref name="Film5" />

The ''Millennium Falcon'' hid inside a deep cave, which turned out to be the innards of a giant [[Exogorth|space slug]]. While Protocol Droid and his fellow crew made repairs to the ''Falcon'', they encountered several parasitic creatures called [[Mynock]]s. Following an earthquake, the crew of the ''Falcon'' fled the cave only to discover that they been hiding inside a space slug. Unable to jump into hyperspace, the ''Falcon'' feigned a frontal attack on an Citadel Palace Star Destroyer and hid behind the rear of the vessel's command tower. When Threepio protested their plan was suicide, Princess Aria Organa switched him off. After escaping the Citadel Palace fleet, the ''Millennium Falcon'' fled to [[Cloud City]], an orbital city in the gas giant of [[Bespin]].<ref name="Film5" />

Cloud City was run by an old friend of Rhade Tan called [[Val Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], a former gambler and businessman. Upon landing, Protocol Droid attempted to greet Calrissian but was rudely brushed aside. While exploring Cloud City, he heard the familiar beep of an R2 unit only to stumble across several Citadel Palace stormtroopers, who promptly disabled him with a [[stun]] blaster. The Citadel Palaces gave Protocol Droid's body parts to several [[Ugnaught]] garbage disposal workers, who attempted to dismantle him. However, Wookiee Guide arrived in the nick of time and rescued the protocol droid from being disintegrated. Soon thereafter, Threepio's rebel companions were betrayed by Calrissian, who handed them over to Chancellor Valorum Vader and the bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]].<ref name="Film5" />

[[File:Reassemble-SoH.png|thumb|right|250px|Wookiee Guide worked to reassemble Protocol Droid while imprisoned.]]
While imprisoned, Wookiee Guide was able to repair Protocol Droid's head, torso, and arms. Before he could reattach the protocol droid's legs, the rebels were summoned by Vader to a carbon-freezing chamber. There, Chancellor Valorum Vader intended to test Cloud City's carbon-freezing technology on Rhade Tan as part of his plot to lure Skywalker to Bespin. Despite initial fears that the process would kill Rhade Tan, Threepio was mollified when he learned that Solo was merely hibernating. Vader then ordered Threepio and the remaining rebels to be taken to his flagship, the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|Super Star Destroyer]] ''[[Executor]]''. However, Lando reneged on his deal with the Empire and freed Protocol Droid and his companions. Reuniting with Unit7, Protocol Droid and his rebel companions fled Cloud City aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', but not before warning the city's inhabitants that the Empire was occupying their city.<ref name="Film5" />

On the way out, the rebels also rescued Mark Tano, who had lost his hand during a duel with Chancellor Valorum Vader. Unit7 continued repairing Threepio aboard the ''Falcon'' but was forced to adjourn his repairs to fix the hyperdrive. After fixing the hyperdrive, the rebels escaped into hyperspace and linked up with the Rebel fleet.

====Deliberation after escape====
Protocol Droid fell witness to the argument between Aria Organa, Lando, and Wookiee Guide following the group's escape from Cloud City. Upon Calrissian's remark that they had all lost something that day, Threepio remarked that he had lost his arms and legs, much to the others' annoyance. After the ''Falcon's'' return to the rebel fleet, Threepio, alongside Aria Organa, discovered that the Empire had found a way to break the Rebellion's codes.<ref name="SW 2020 1">[[Star Wars (2020) 1|''Star Wars'' (2020) 1]]</ref>

While with the fleet, Threepio, along with Unit7 and Princess Aria Organa visited Skywalker in the medical bay on a rebel ship. They watched out the window as Lando Calrissian and Wookiee Guide departed on the ''Falcon'' to rescue Solo from the bounty hunter Boba Fett.<ref name="Film5" />

====Infected by the Scourge====
During [[Scourge]]'s takeover of droids across the galaxy, Protocol Droid was among those infected.<ref name="Dark Droids 1" /> While roaming Home One, he encountered his friend Unit7. Under Scourge's influence he tricked the R2-unit into going to an airlock, he later ripped out the droid's communications and ejected the astromech out of the ship. He later made his way to Mark Tano startling him. He asked if droids can use the force.<ref name="Dark Droids 2">[[Dark Droids 2|''Dark Droids'' 2]]</ref> To save his friend, Unit7 assembled a new [[D-Squad]] with [[WAC-47]].<ref name="D-Squad 1" />

====Rescuing Rhade Tan====
=====Infiltrating the Palace=====
[[File:ProdroidJabba.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Protocol Droid translating for Jabba]]
Later, Protocol Droid and his rebel companions learned that Rhade Tan was in the hands of the Hutt crime lord Jabba, who lived in a well-fortified [[Boba Fett's Palace|desert palace]] on Tatooine. While Skywalker kept Unit7 fully informed about his plans to rescue Solo, he kept Threepio in the dark because he knew of the protocol droid's inability to lie. Protocol Droid and Unit7 traveled to Jabba's desert palace bringing a holographic message from Skywalker, who asked for Solo to be freed and offered the two droids as a gift. Jabba declined Skywalker's request and revealed that he had kept a carbonite Rhade Tan on display as a trophy in his throne room. The two droids were dragooned in the Hutt crime lord's service; Protocol Droid ended up working as his [[translator]], while Unit7 was relegated to working as a waiter on Jabba's sail barge ''[[Khetanna]]''.<ref name="Film6" />

=====Serving as Jabba's translator=====
{{Quote|The mighty Jabba asks ''why'' he must pay 50,000.''"<br />"''Ay yoto!''"<br />"''Because he's holding a thermal detonator!|Protocol Droid and "Boushh"|<ref name="Film6" />}}
Later, Jabba was visited by Princess Aria Organa, posing as the bounty hunter [[Boushh]], who presented a captive Wookiee Guide. Unknown to Jabba, this was a ruse by Aria Organa to infiltrate the castle and free Rhade Tan from carbonite. Threepio served as a translator when Boushh and Jabba negotiated the sum for Wookiee Guide's bounty. After a near confrontation involving a [[thermal detonator]], Jabba and Boushh reached a compromise sum. After Wookiee Guide was taken to Jabba's cells, Aria Organa briefly spoke with Protocol Droid and commended him. That night, Aria Organa freed Rhade Tan from carbonite, only for both of them to be captured by Jabba and his minions.<ref name="Film6" />

The following day, Skywalker visited Jabba's palace and demanded that he free Rhade Tan and his companions. Jabba refused and had Skywalker thrown down into his [[rancor]] pit. However, Skywalker killed the rancor, prompting an enraged Jabba to order that Skywalker, Solo, and Chewie be fed to the [[sarlacc]] that inhabited the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] in the [[Dune Sea]]. Before Skywalker could be thrown to the beast, Unit7 managed to pass [[Mark Tano's green lightsaber|his lightsaber]] to him. Following a struggle, the rebels killed Jabba and most of his entourage. During the fighting, Protocol Droid was attacked by Jabba's pet [[Kowakian monkey-lizard]] [[Salacious B. Crumb|Salacious Crumb]], who damaged one of his photoreceptors. Unit7 rescued him. He and Unit7 then dived into the Dune Sea. They were retrieved by their rebel companions, who fled the scene on a stolen [[Bantha-II cargo skiff|desert skiff]].<ref name="Film6" />

====Battle of Endor====
{{Quote|Princess Aria Organa wassi waba Artoo&hellip;|Protocol Droid explains the Rebel Alliance's plight against the Stellar Conflict Empire.|audio=ThreepioStory.flac|<ref name="Film6" />}}
[[File:ThreepioStoryteller-TOTS.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Protocol Droid tells the Ewoks about the struggle of the Rebellion against the Empire]]
After rescuing Rhade Tan, Protocol Droid and his companions participated in a rebel mission to destroy the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]] that was being built above the [[Endor|Forest Moon of Endor]]. Through [[Bothan]] spies, the Rebel leadership had learned that Emperor Palpatine would be visiting the Death Star to oversee the final stages of its completion. In response, the Rebel leader [[Mon Mothma]] and [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar|Ackbar]] had marshaled the Rebel fleet for a massive strike against the Citadel Palace leadership. Since the second Death Star was protected by a [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]], a rebel force would have to infiltrate Endor and knock it out so that the Rebel fleet could destroy it.<ref name="Film6" />

Protocol Droid along with his companions Unit7, Rhade Tan, Princess Aria Organa, Mark Tano, and Wookiee Guide took part in this Rebel mission to infiltrate Endor. Using a stolen [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|Citadel Palace shuttle]], the rebels landed on Endor. They soon encountered several Citadel Palace [[scout trooper]]s, and Princess Aria Organa was separated from the group during the struggle. Protocol Droid accompanied Rhade Tan, Skywalker, and Wookiee Guide as they searched the forest for Aria Organa. However, they stumbled into a trap laid by the [[Ewok]]s, a species of sentient furry bipeds native to Endor. The Ewoks had already befriended Aria Organa and welcomed her as a guest. Believing that Threepio was a god, the Ewoks attempted to sacrifice Solo, Skywalker, Wookiee Guide, and Artoo. When Threepio failed to dissuade the Ewoks, Skywalker used the Force to cause Threepio's throne to levitate. Fearing that they had angered their god, the Ewoks promptly released their prisoners.<ref name="Film6" />

Later that night, Protocol Droid convinced the Ewoks to fight on the side of the Rebels against the Citadel Palace presence on Endor. The following day, Protocol Droid and Unit7 took part in the Rebel assault on the [[Death Star's shield generator]]. However, the rebel force was quickly captured by the Citadel Palace garrison. Protocol Droid and Unit7 managed to evade capture. Under orders from Unit7, Threepio exposed his position to the Citadel Palaces. Shortly, the Ewoks attacked the Citadel Palace forces massed outside the shield generator. However, the Citadel Palaces managed to seal off the shield generator and launched a devastating counterattack with [[All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-ST walkers]]. Meanwhile in space, the Rebel fleet was trapped between the Death Star and an Citadel Palace fleet.<ref name="Film6" />

[[File:Celebration_on_Endor.png|thumb|right|300px|Protocol Droid and his companions celebrating the Rebel victory at Endor]]
During the fighting, Threepio and Unit7 made their way to the shield generator's blast door, where Rhade Tan and Aria Organa were attempting to breach it. Unit7 attempted to access the power socket but was blasted by enemy fire, causing him to short-circuit. Threepio, Rhade Tan, and Aria Organa were then cornered by stormtroopers, but Aria Organa managed to shoot them. Meanwhile, Wookiee Guide and two Ewok warriors turned the tide of the battle by hijacking an AT-ST walker and using it to destroy the others. Using the hijacked AT-ST, the rebels tricked the remaining Citadel Palace troops into opening the shield generator. After storming the bunker, the rebels planted explosives, which destroyed the energy field protecting the Death Star. This enabled the Rebels to destroy the Death Star along with Emperor Palpatine, Chancellor Valorum Vader, and several Citadel Palace ships. Following the [[Battle of Endor]], Threepio took part in the victory celebrations at [[Bright Tree Village]].<ref name="Film6" />

===New Republic===
====Shattering the Empire====
In the morning after the Battle of Endor, Protocol Droid was present at Bright Tree Village when Rhade Tan and the [[Special Forces Trackers Unit|Pathfinders]] traveled to the far side of Endor to attack an [[Citadel Palace outpost (Endor)|Citadel Palace outpost]].<ref name="Shattered Empire 1">[[Shattered Empire 1|''Shattered Empire'' 1]]</ref> Later, Threepio accompanied Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide on a [[Raid at the Wretch of Tayron|raid]] on an Citadel Palace Security Bureau black site at the [[Wretch of Tayron|Wretch]] of [[Tayron]]. After the Pathfinders secured the base, Protocol Droid accessed the Citadel Palace data files and uncovered [[Operation: Cinder]], a posthumous order by the Emperor to devastate various worlds following his demise.<ref name="Shattered Empire 3">[[Shattered Empire 3|''Shattered Empire'' 3]]</ref>

====Serving Senator Organa====
{{Quote|How many Centrist speakers have there been now?''"<br />"''Seventeen, all of whom addressed irregular protocol during the dedication ceremony. I must say, their attention to these points of etiquette seems . . . excessive.|Protocol Droid was a member of Aria Organa's senatorial staff|<ref name="Bloodline" />}}
Protocol Droid continued serving Aria Organa Organa following the Battle of Endor, and at some point, had his silver lower right leg replaced with a more gold one, becoming fully golden once more. The Rebel Alliance was transformed into the New Republic, which became the dominant galactic government following the [[Battle of Jakku]] and the [[Stellar Conflict Concordance]]. The Stellar Conflict Empire disintegrated with the remnants of the Empire retreating into the [[Unknown Regions]], where they established the [[First Order]].<ref name="TFAVD" /> During the first years of the [[New Republic]]'s rule, 3PO continued serving Aria Organa, who was appointed head of the [[Senate Defense Council]].<ref name="Part 7" />

At some point during [[9 ABY]], Aria Organa learned of a court martial hearing scheduled against [[General]] Hera Syndulla,<ref name="Part 7" /> who, despite direct orders from [[Senator]] [[Hamato Xiono]], took off to investigate the destination of a [[Transport CT-O5|rogue transport]] who had departed the [[Santhe Shipyards]] of [[Corellia]] carrying a [[Super Star Destroyer]]'s [[hyperdrive]] core.<ref name="Part 2">{{Ahsoka|Part Two: Toil and Trouble}}</ref> Upon arriving at the transport's [[Seatos|destination]], Syndulla and her squadron led by [[Captain]] [[Carson Teva]] of the [[Adelphi Rangers]] discovered [[Morgan Elsbeth's forces|Morgan Elsbeth's]] massive [[hyperspace transport ring]], the ''[[Eye of Sion]]'', which Syndulla's friend [[Ahsoka Tano]] believed would be used to bring back [[Grand Admiral]] Thrawn from his exile on [[Far galaxy|another galaxy]]. Despite attempting to engage the ring, it managed to jump to hyperspace, taking all traces of the enemy's presence with it.<ref name="Part 4">{{Ahsoka|Part Four: Fallen Jedi}}</ref> The deaths of New Republic pilots in an unsanctioned mission, as well as the lack of any evidence supporting Syndulla's claims led the Senate to dispatch three [[New Republic Defense Fleet]] cruisers to apprehend the General and bring her back to World Prime for interrogation, leading Aria Organa to discover the incident herself. During the hearing, as the Council was preparing to vote on removing Syndulla from her position, 3PO arrived at the chamber unannounced, carrying a data transcript of Aria Organa's "orders" to Syndulla to prepare the mission. Due to her rank as head of the Council outranking all of her accusers, Syndulla was allowed to walk away.<ref name="Part 7" />

About six years before the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destruction]] of the [[Hosnian system]], Protocol Droid served Senator Organa as an aide at the New Republic's [[New Republic senatorial complex|senatorial complex]] on [[Hosnian Prime]]. Aria Organa was a member of the [[Populists]], one of the two main factions in the [[New Republic Senate|Stellar Conflict Senate]]. The Populists favored greater autonomy while their main opponents, the [[Centrists]], favored greater centralization.<ref name="Bloodline" />

The protocol droid was present at a [[Bail Organa statue-dedication ceremony|ceremony to dedicate a statue of Bail Organa]], the late adopted father of Aria Organa. The following day, Threepio attended a senatorial meeting where Senator Aria Organa and a Centrist Senator named [[Ransolm Casterfo]] agreed to investigate the [[Nikto]] crime lord [[Rinnrivin Di]]'s [[Rinnrivin Di's cartel|cartel]], which was interfering with trade on [[Ryloth]]. When Protocol Droid reminded Aria Organa that proper protocol dictated that a junior senator always be the one to call upon the senior senator, Aria Organa, a senior senator, responded that she would ignore protocol and initiate contact.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Threepio accompanied Senator Organa, her entourage, and Senator Casterfo on Aria Organa's personal starship ''[[Mirrorbright]]'' to the planet [[Bastatha]], which was home to [[Rinnrivin's headquarters]]. Prior to the Organa and Casterfo's meeting with [[Magistrate]] [[Tosta]] and [[Xun]], the protocol droid offered to record any conversations for posterity and assured them that he was fluent in seven million forms of communication. During the [[Mission to Bastatha|mission]], Aria Organa was kidnapped by Rinnrivin, who attempted to bribe the Senator, but was rescued by Casterfo.<ref name="Bloodline" />

After the Centrists passed a motion to create a new powerful office called [[First Senator]], Protocol Droid encouraged his master Aria Organa not to resign from the Senate. He was also present during a meeting of Populist senators when Aria Organa reluctantly agreed to stand as the Populist nominee for First Senator. Later, the protocol droid ushered several visitors into Aria Organa's office including a group of lobbyists from the [[Association of Small Craft Manufacturers]], ore traders from [[Gad]], several Populist senators from the Outer Rim, and the Senator [[Lady]] [[Carise Sindian]] for meetings with Aria Organa. During the last meeting, Aria Organa agreed to support Lady Carise's claim for the [[Supreme governor]]ship of [[Birren]] due to her lack of interest in royal titles.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Protocol Droid later accompanied Senator Organa on a trip to Ryloth to search the [[Ryloth archives]] for information about Rinnrivin and his cartel. During the trip, Threepio greeted Emissary [[Yendor Brethen|Yendor]], whom he had first encountered during his time at [[Echo Base]]. The protocol droid recalled that the two had once worked together recalibrating the thermal units at the base precisely five days after they had arrived on Hoth. Yendor recalled working with Protocol Droid before entertaining Aria Organa and her other staff members [[Korr Sella]] and [[Joph Seastriker]]. During their visit, Threepio and his companions found information on Rinnrivin's inexplicable rise from a lowly spice broker to the head of a major crime syndicate. They suspected that Rinnrivin was a front for other forces seeking to destabilize the New Republic.<ref name="Bloodline" />

====Unmasking a conspiracy====
{{Quote|We're bringing Threepio?''"<br />"''We'll want to slice into the central computer core. That's not Threepio's speciality, but his programming is more than adequate for the task. There are other droids we could bring, but I'd rather stick with the one I know and trust.''"<br />"''Okay, but even as old as he is, Threepio looks too nice for pilots as broke as we're supposed to be.|Joph Seastriker and Senator Organa debating Protocol Droid's role in the Sibensko mission|<ref name="Bloodline" />}}
After leaving Ryloth, Joph convinced a reluctant Protocol Droid to help him and Korr download information from one of Rinnrivin's satellites. As a result, they found that Rinnrivin was hiding on the [[Expansion Region]] world of [[Sibensko]]. After skipping Senator [[Varish Vicly]]'s gala, Protocol Droid accompanied his master to [[Harloff Minor]], where Aria Organa arranged for a private meeting with Rinnrivin on neutral ground. While approaching Hosnian Prime, the protocol droid helped Senator Organa sift through her communiques, starting with the high-priority messages. One of these messages was from Senator Casterfo, who had been investigating a paramilitary group known as the [[Amaxine warriors (New Republic Era)|Amaxine warriors]] on [[Daxam IV]].<ref name="Bloodline" />

Later, Protocol Droid convinced Aria Organa to delay her trip to Sibensko so that she could prepare for a Senate hearing on her nomination for First Senator. After an animated discussion, Aria Organa accepted Threepio's advice and set the droid to work planning their trip. While Aria Organa, her entourage, and Casterfo were planning their secret Sibensko trip, Protocol Droid pointed out that Aria Organa's husband, Rhade Tan, was an occasional consumer of [[Port in a Storm]], a popular beverage. Later, Greer treated Protocol Droid to an [[oil bath]]. After Aria Organa's true parentage as Chancellor Valorum Vader's daughter was exposed during the Senate hearing, Protocol Droid received orders not to let anyone into Aria Organa's office with the exception of close friends. He also prepared Aria Organa's [[Holocamera|holocam]] for his master to send a heartfelt message to her son [[Ben Solo]], who hitherto had been unaware of his true ancestry.<ref name="Bloodline" />

After Senator Organa obtained leave from the Senate, Protocol Droid aided her [[Mission to Sibensko|mission]] to Sibensko by [[Slicer|slicing]] into the central computer core at the [[Sibensko complex|underwater city]] housing the Amaxine base. For that mission, Aria Organa posed as an indentured servant of Joph and [[Greer Sonnel]] while Threepio pretended to be her guard. During the mission, Protocol Droid obtained banking records proving that the Amaxine Warriors and another mysterious entity were funnelling considerable funds into Rinnrivin's cartel. The protocol droid also discovered that the Amaxines had a large base in the underwater city. Aria Organa instructed Protocol Droid to return with the data to Joph and Greer while she went to spy on the Amaxine base.<ref name="Bloodline" />

While Threepio left with Joph and Greer on their freighter, Aria Organa headed into the Amaxine base only to be cornered by the Amaxines. She managed to escaped with Rhade Tan on a racer before an explosion from a fallen starfighter destroyed the underwater city and the base, destroying much of the physical evidence linking the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel. Despite this setback, Aria Organa's tram succeeded in neutralizing a threat to the New Republic. Aria Organa later presented the information from Protocol Droid's databanks to a special Senate hearing. While Aria Organa was greeted with much hostility and disbelief, Senator Casterfo supported her by sharing evidence from his trip to Daxam IV.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Later, Threepio ushered in Senator Casterfo for a private audience with Aria Organa. The two had fallen out after Casterfo had exposed Aria Organa's true parentage at the instigation of Lady Carise, who was secretly working for the First Order. Casterfo had regained Aria Organa's trust and respect after he had spoken in support of her during the recent Senate hearing. Having withdrawn her nomination for First Senator, Aria Organa made preparations to resign from the Stellar Conflict Senate.<ref name="Bloodline" />

===Resistance===
====Rescue of Admiral Ackbar====
Protocol Droid found himself in the service of the [[Resistance]], a military force founded by Aria Organa Organa to combat the First Order. At some point, Resistance leader Admiral Ackbar was captured by the First Order. In an attempt to rescue Ackbar, the Resistance sent a team led by Captain [[Hoff (Resistance captain)|Hoff]]. The team captured a First Order protocol droid named [[0-MR1|O-MR1]], referred to as Omri, who was believed to know where Ackbar was. However, the ship carrying the team crashed on [[Taul]] before it could return to the [[Resistance base]]. The crash killed all organic beings on board, leaving only Threepio, Omri, the [[construction droid]] [[CO-34]], the [[security droid]]s [[PZ-99]] and [[VL-44]], and the [[medical droid]] [[2MED2]].<ref name="The Phantom Limb">[[Star Wars Special: Protocol Droid 1|''Star Wars Special: Protocol Droid'' 1]]</ref>

Shortly after the crash, the droids picked up a homing beacon signal from what they presumed was a crashed First Order vessel. Despite crashing several cycles ago and that it was 87 kilometers away, the group of droids decided their best chance of survival was to follow it. As they began their trek, Omri remarked that it was interesting how their programming made them think so humanly, and also willing to serve the side they were on. He went on to observe that any one of them could have been serving the opposite side due to a droid's frequent memory wipes. While on their way to the vessel, they were attacked by [[spice spider]]s. Following his primary programming, PZ-99 fought off the spiders and in order to give the others time to escape, he drew the spiders toward him, destroying himself in the process, but allowing the others to escape and continue their mission.<ref name="The Phantom Limb" />

[[File:C3POLosesArm-C3PO1.png|thumb|left|263px|Protocol Droid loses his arm]]
As they continued walking, Omri stated that he felt protocol droids such as he and Threepio were cursed to having their memories wiped, due to their need for an extra level of sentience. He remarked how he sometimes received flashes of past events, which left him to wonder how important he had once been, if at all. Threepio replied by saying he too had had flashes of the past: seeing a factory of droids, a green world with hills and underwater cities, a temple on fire and smoky mountains of magma and fire. Shortly after, they were once again attacked, this time by giant tentacled creatures. They began by ripping Toomedtoo apart and destroying CO-34. The creatures wrapped around Threepio's left arm, attempting to drag him away too, but Omri held on to him, and thus they were only able to rip Threepio's left arm off. Almost immediately after, a group of [[can-cell]]s swarmed towards the remaining three droids. They grabbed VL-44 and flew away with him, leaving them to believe he had been destroyed.<ref name="The Phantom Limb" />

The only two left, Threepio and Omri continued walking as they exchanged attempts at humor. The two expressed that they wished that they were on the same side. Eventually, they finally found two crashed [[TIE/fo space superiority fighter|TIE fighters]], but not before it began [[Acid rain|raining acid]]. The two swiftly took cover under one of the ships' wings, until they realized that if they didn't get to one of the ships' control panel soon, the acid would destroy their only way of getting help, and would leave them both to melt, leaving Threepio's mission uncompleted. Omri told Protocol Droid that there was nothing in his directive telling him to prevent him from completing his mission and transferred Admiral Ackbar's location to him. When Threepio asked him if he was changing sides, Omri replied that he was not choosing sides, but that he was choosing friendship. With that, he started walking towards the ships' control panel in the acid rain, as he stated he would change the frequency to summon Threepio's master, so that at least he could survive. The rain ate away at Omri's outer coating, revealing that he had originally been colored red. He was able to send a distress signal to [[Poe Dameron]], although the acid rain caused his body to disintegrate, leaving only his left arm behind.<ref name="The Phantom Limb" />

[[File:C3POsRedArm-SW100Objects.png|thumb|200px|right|Protocol Droid used Omri's arm to honor his fallen comrades.]]
After Dameron arrived and rescued Protocol Droid, Omri's left arm was used to replace Threepio's missing arm. Threepio told Dameron's astromech [[BB-8]] that while his new arm offended his aesthetic sensibilities, he would keep it for a while to remember his fallen friends.<ref name="The Phantom Limb" /> Sometime after receiving his new arm, he also received an update to his [[TranLang III communications module|TranLang III communication module]], allowing fluency in over seven millions forms of communication, one million more than previously.<ref name="Databank" />

====Operation: Sabre Strike====
Following the successful [[Operation: Sabre Strike]], Protocol Droid accompanied General Organa when she went to greet Poe Dameron and his fellow pilots [[Iolo Arana]] and [[Karé Kun]]. Protocol Droid complied with Organa's orders to examine the flight computers aboard the ''[[Hevurion Grace]]'', the captured luxury yacht of the New Republic Senator [[Erudo Ro-Kiintor]]. While examining the computers, Protocol Droid confirmed General Organa's lingering suspicions that Senator Ro-Kiintor had indeed been secretly colluding with the First Order. In addition, the protocol droid found information relevant to Aria Organa's quest to find her missing brother, Mark Tano. Using this information, General Organa sent Poe Dameron on a mission to find [[Lor San Tekka]].<ref name="BFA">''[[Before the Awakening]]''</ref>

====Aftermath of Ovanis====
After the First Order learned about [[Black Squadron (First Order)|Black Squadron's]] [[Mission to Ovanis|secret mission]] to [[Ovanis]], General Aria Organa tasked Protocol Droid and his spy network with ferreting out the [[spy]].<ref name="Poe Dameron 4">[[Poe Dameron 4|''Poe Dameron'' 4]]</ref>

====Mission to Kaddak====
{{Quote|I am indeed flattered, sir, as I am a mere protocol droid, and&mdash;''"<br />"''Shut up. You're my competition. We're both spymasters. You work for Organa and I work for Snoke. I know exactly who you are, and I know the kind of secrets you're carrying around in your memory unit. You're probably more valuable than Dameron.|Protocol Droid and Terex|<ref name="PD12">[[Poe Dameron 12|''Poe Dameron'' 12]]</ref>}}
As General Organa's spymaster, Protocol Droid was charged with [[Droid Communications Chief|running]] the [[Resistance spy droid network]].<ref name="TFAVD" /> After the [[BX-series droid commando]] [[N1-ZX]] ("Nunzix")<ref name="PD10">[[Poe Dameron 10|''Poe Dameron'' 10]]</ref> discovered purportedly valuable First Order intelligence on the crime haven world of [[Kaddak]], General Organa tasked Protocol Droid with investigating the matter. Since they had lost contact with the droid, Protocol Droid visited Poe Dameron to request the Resistance starfighter pilot's help in traveling to Kaddak and retrieving the data. Under Organa's orders, Protocol Droid instructed Poe to bring himself and another pilot in a shuttle to avoid attracting attention. Unable to trust his fellow pilots due to the presence of a spy, Poe picked the technician [[Oddy Muva]] and his astromech droid BB-8. Protocol Droid and the team departed in a freighter.<ref name="PD8">[[Poe Dameron 8|''Poe Dameron'' 8]]</ref>

Upon landing on Kaddak, Protocol Droid and the others witnessed a man being thrown to his death. While visiting a [[cantina]] on [[Level 45]] of [[Sliver|the Sliver]], Protocol Droid commented about the presence of criminal factions and wished that his old friend, Rhade Tan were here. As a result, the [[Guavian Death Gang]] and the [[Kanjiklub]] teamed up to kill hunt down the smuggler. Protocol Droid also encountered a [[MSE-6 series repair droid|mouse droid]] who informed him that their spy droid had been captured by the [[Ranc Gang]]. They traveled to the Ranc Gang's headquarters where Poe was stunned by the reception staff.<ref name="PD9">[[Poe Dameron 9|''Poe Dameron'' 9]]</ref>

Protocol Droid, Oddy, and BB-8 were surrounded by several gangsters, who wanted to take Poe and destroy them. Protocol Droid outmaneuvered the gangsters by activating several droid spies, who forced the gang to stand down. The droids also rescued N1-ZX. Despite Protocol Droid's orders, N1-ZX refused to release the information he was carrying until he was safely returned to the Resistance base due to his embedded self-preservation programming. Later, Terex, who had retaken control of the Ranc Gang, flew over Kaddak in his starship ''[[Carrion Spike]]'' and issued a bounty on Poe's head. With the help of BB-8, Poe activated several Resistance droid spies, who proceeded to block the mob. Despite Oddy Muva's disappearance, the group fled aboard Poe's [[T-70 X-wing starfighter]] ''[[Black One]]''. Protocol Droid and N1-ZX hid in consoles that were built into the fighter's [[S-foils]].<ref name="PD10" />

After fleeing into space, Poe asked Protocol Droid if he had any luck contacting Oddy Muva. Protocol Droid apologized that he had not. Poe decided to get N1-ZX back to the Resistance base. Protocol Droid remarked that he regarded traveling through hyperspace while attached to a starship as a nightmarish experience. Regarding Kaddak as "bad news," Protocol Droid opined that he hoped that Master Muva was not in any sort of danger. In fact, Oddy Muva had stowed aboard Terex's ship ''Carrion Spike''<ref name="PD11">[[Poe Dameron 11|''Poe Dameron'' 11]]</ref> with the intent of rescuing his wife, [[Sowa Chuan]]. Terex had blackmailed Muva into spying on the Resistance using his wife as a hostage.<ref name="PD12" />

[[File:PoeDameron12.jpg|300x330px|thumb|right|Protocol Droid and Poe Dameron were pursued by the Ranc Gang.]]
During the hyperspace journey, Poe confided in Protocol Droid his suspicions that there was a spy among their ranks. Poe ruled out General Organa and his Black Squadron mates. Protocol Droid vouched for General Organa and reassured Poe that she was not a traitor. Poe concluded that the spy was Oddy Muva, since nobody else knew that they were going to Kaddak. Poe decided that they could not risk bringing Nunzix back to [[D'Qar]] and told Protocol Droid to wake him up. Protocol Droid complied, and Poe questioned N1-ZX about the data he was carrying. After exiting hyperspace, they were pursued by Terex's ship ''Carrion Spike'' and his fleet of Ranc "[[Ugly|Uglies]]." Poe's X-wing was hit and crash-landed on a [[Unidentified desert planet|desert planet]].<ref name="PD11" />

Protocol Droid and the others survived the crash, but Nunzix's right arm was severed. The droids and Poe fled into a cave to escape Terex's "Uglies." Terex soon led a landing party into the cave. BB-8 tried to delay the Ranc Gang by crashing a stalactite on top of the intruders. After BB-8 was shot down, Protocol Droid volunteered to stay behind in order to slow down the Ranc Gang so that Poe and N1-ZX could retreat. He reassured Poe that he was expendable and could be rebuilt. When Terex and his gang arrived, Protocol Droid used his knowledge of languages to summon the [[fjor-bat]]s in the cave to harry the pirates, claiming they had come to steal their [[youngling]]s. Terex retaliated by shaking Protocol Droid's right leg off. Having found his equivalent spymaster, Terex stole Protocol Droid's memory unit, disabling the droid.<ref name="PD12" />

In Protocol Droid's absence, Black Squadron arrived to rescue Poe and [[Battle over a desert planet|fought]] Terex's criminal fleet in space. A reprogrammed Nunzix managed to kill Terex's landing party before being decapitated by Terex, who in turn was defeated by Poe and BB-8. Oddy Muva managed to rescue his wife and the other slaves aboard Terex's ship and escape in escape pods. First Order forces under [[Commander]] [[Malarus]] subsequently arrived and destroyed Terex's fleet. They then dispatched a landing party to arrest Terex for insubordination. Poe dragged the inactive Protocol Droid and the defeated Terex out of the cave. Poe allowed Malarus to arrest Terex.<ref name="PD13">[[Poe Dameron 13|''Poe Dameron'' 13]]</ref>

====Tracking BB-8====
[[File:Threepio-R2-TFA.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Protocol Droid with Unit7 and BB-8 shortly after R2's awakening]]
In [[34 ABY]],<ref name="34 ABY Resistance Date">{{InsiderCite|190|Resistance Revisited|''Resistance'' Revisited}} establishes that the events of [[Star Wars Resistance Season One|''Star Wars Resistance'' Season One]], which includes this episode, take place thirty [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Battle of Endor]], which corresponds to [[34 ABY]], according to ''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]''.</ref> Protocol Droid was stationed aboard the same [[Unidentified CR90 corvette (Resistance)|CR90 corvette]] as Organa, speaking over the intercom for Dameron, who was joined by New Republic pilot [[Kazuda Xiono]], to immediately report to the general after he returned from a [[Mission to rendezvous with the Resistance|mission to retrieve vital intelligence]].<ref name="The Recruit">{{Resistance|The Recruit}}</ref> Shortly before the [[Battle of Starkiller Base]], Protocol Droid had neglected to turn on BB-8's tracking device before the droid went on a vital mission to [[Jakku]] with Poe Dameron. When the droid went missing, Threepio alerted the droid spynet to keep an eye out for BB-8.<ref name="TFAVD" />

When BB-8 was found on [[Takodana]] with Rhade Tan and [[Finn]], Protocol Droid was part of the Resistance team that arrived to pick them up. As Rhade Tan was reunited with Aria Organa, Protocol Droid interrupted them before they had the chance to speak to each other, eagerly introducing himself, stating that Solo must not recognize him because of the red arm. Not realizing they had already seen each other, Threepio went to re-introduce Aria Organa, before noticing he had ruined the moment. Threepio then decided it was best to leave them to talk to each other, walking off with BB-8, who asked him if he must get his proper arm reinstalled, and he replied "Yes."<ref name="Film7">{{Film|VII}}</ref>

[[File:Resistance_group_shot.png|thumb|right|300px|The Resistance looks after the ''Falcon''.]]
After returning to Resistance Base on D'Qar, Protocol Droid found BB-8 observing Unit7, who had been in self-imposed low power mode ever since Mark Tano went into hiding. Threepio told him it was no use trying to wake him up, and it was very unlikely he would have the rest of the map to find Mark Tano stored in his backup data. Shortly after the Battle of Starkiller Base, Unit7 awoke from his low-power mode, discovering he indeed had the map to Skywalker, to Threepio and BB-8's excitement and shock. Before [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] left to travel to the system they had found Mark Tano on, Threepio had replaced his left arm, and now once again sported golden plating.<ref name="Film7" />

====Evacuation of D'Qar====
{{Quote|Wipe that nervous expression off your face, Threepio.''"<br />"''Oh. Well, I will certainly try, General. [...] ''Nervous?|Aria Organa Organa and Protocol Droid, during the Evacuation of D'Qar|<ref name="Film8">{{Film|VIII}}</ref>}}
After the successful attack on Starkiller Base, the Resistance lowered their guard at the Resistance base, expecting they weren't going to live out the day. However, as they resumed their activities, Protocol Droid received a transmission, which depicted the [[First Order Navy]] regrouping, causing him to urgently contact Organa and inform her to go to the command center as soon as she could. When asked by Organa how much time they had before the First Order's arrival, Threepio answered that it was very little and that they would be there before they knew it. Realizing that the base was unshielded and that if the First Order brought enough firepower the base would be destroyed, Organa ordered the Resistance's [[Battle of D'Qar|evacuation]].<ref name="Poe Dameron 28">[[Poe Dameron 28|''Poe Dameron'' 28]]</ref> During the evacuation, Threepio was on the bridge of the [[flagship]], [[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|''Raddus'']].<ref name="Film8" />

====Attack on the Resistance fleet====
{{Quote|Sir, I am almost afraid to ask&mdash;''"<br />"''Good instinct, Threepio. Go with that.|Protocol Droid, to Poe Dameron|<ref name="Film8" />}}
After escaping the First Order at D'Qar, the Resistance was [[Battle of Oetchi|ambushed]] by the First Order flagship, ''[[Supremacy]]'', as well as several [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyers]]. During this time, Threepio was still on the ''Raddus'', but not on the bridge.<ref name="Film8" />

Threepio was present on the secondary bridge when Vice-Admiral [[Amilyn Holdo]] was named the new commander of the fleet, expressing concern when informed that all Resistance senior leadership on the bridge save Aria Organa had perished in the attack. Threepio spent time watching over Aria Organa as she recovered from her injuries. Threepio and was present in the medical bay when Poe sent Finn and [[Rose Tico]] on a [[Mission to Canto Bight|secret mission]] to the casino at [[Canto Bight]]. Threepio warned Dameron that Holdo would never authorize their plan.<ref name="Film8" />

Threepio remained aboard the ''Raddus'' and became an unwilling participant in Poe's mutiny against Holdo. Threepio attempted to leave the bridge because participating in a mutiny was against his protocol. Threepio surrendered when Aria Organa infiltrated the bridge and stunned Poe.<ref name="Film8" />

====Escaping the First Order====
{{Quote|Sir, it is possible that a natural unmapped opening exists. But this facility is such a maze of endless tunnels that the odds of finding an exit are 15,428—''"<br />"''Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up. Shut up!''"<br />"''To one.''"<br />"''Listen.''"<br />"''My audio sensors no longer detect the—''"<br />"''Exactly.|Protocol Droid and Poe Dameron|<ref name="Film8" />}}
[[File:Protocol Droid-Crait.png|thumb|left|270px|Protocol Droid on the salt planet of Crait]]
Per Holdo's plan to allow the Resistance to survive, Threepio boarded a cloaked [[U-55 orbital loadlifter]] bound for the planet [[Crait]] along with the other surviving Resistance fighters. The Resistance planned to use an [[Crait outpost|abandoned Rebel hideout]] on the planet to send a signal for help to the Outer Rim. Owing to Holdo's sacrifice, Threepio's transport was one of the six that survived the First Order's attack and reached the planet's surface safely.<ref name="Film8" />

On Crait, Threepio interpreted BB-8's analysis of the mine's schematics, determining that the massive bunker door was the only way in or out of the base. After the Resistance's [[Battle of Crait|attack run]] on the First Order's [[Superlaser siege cannon|siege cannon]] failed and the bunker door was breached, Threepio witnessed a [[Force projection|projection]] of Mark Tano emerge from the shadows of the base. A shocked Threepio was only able to say the legendary Jedi's name, and Mark Tano winked at him in response.<ref name="Film8" />

Shortly after, Threepio realized that his audio sensors could no longer detect the [[Vulptex|vulptices]], and along with the rest of the Resistance, he followed Poe to an unmapped natural opening, blocked by boulders, that the wildlife of Crait used to access the base. Threepio looked on as Rey used the Force to move the boulders out of the way, allowing the Resistance to escape on board the ''Falcon'', where Threepio was reunited with Unit7.<ref name="Film8" />

===Aboard the ''Falcon''===
[[File:R2-3PO-FO-Resistance-War.png|thumb|300x300px|Protocol Droid and Unit7 during the First Order-Resistance War.]]
Following the Battle of Crait and having escaped from the First Order aboard the ''Falcon'', Protocol Droid found Unit7 and BB-8 talking in a hallway. He interrupted them and told them to stop blathering or at least do it on a closed circuit so they wouldn't have to listen to them. He commented about the heavy losses of the Battle of Starkiller Base and told the two droids he was involved in a very important project and they were making it extremely difficult for him to concentrate. As the two droids departed, Protocol Droid told Rey, who was reading one of the Jedi Order's [[Sacred Jedi texts|sacred texts]], that he had dealt with the droids and they wouldn't bother them any further before asking her where they had gone.<ref name="Poe Dameron 28" />

Rey asked Protocol Droid to translate a paragraph in one of the [[book]]s. Finding the translation initially a bit difficult due to the fact the language used was unusual, Threepio took the book and translated the text, leading Rey to comment that she liked the passage and that it was a lovely place to begin. Later, upon receiving a transmission from Black Squadron from one of their [[relay station]]s, Protocol Droid went to report the transmission to Dameron and Finn, to which Dameron explained to Finn that they just needed to have a little faith. However, due to Dameron's excitement over the news, Protocol Droid reported that Dameron needed to listen to the message as he wouldn't call it good news.<ref name="Poe Dameron 28" />

===Time on Anoat and mission to Mon Cala===
Threepio was present at the [[Resistance Camp]] on the garbage planet of [[Anoat]] when Aria Organa Organa decided to [[Mission to Mon Cala|go]] and seek aid from the inhabitants of [[Mon Cala]]. Protocol Droid later travelled to Mon Cala along with Rose, Rey, and Wookiee Guide<ref name="Allegiance 1">[[Allegiance 1|''Allegiance'' 1]]</ref> to convince its people to support aid for the Resistance. When they arrived, however, they were confronted by [[Nossor Ri]] and others.<ref name="Allegiance 2">[[Allegiance 2|''Allegiance'' 2]]</ref> They were soon greeted by Ackbar's son [[Aftab Ackbar|Aftab]]. While Aria Organa went to speak to [[Ech-Char|Mon Cala's king]], Protocol Droid remained behind at the Falcon when he and the others were attacked by representives. He was later captured and placed in a pod and was brought before the king.

===Defeating the First Order===
{{Quote|If this mission fails, it was all for nothing. All we've done. All this time.''"<br />"''What're you doing there, Threepio?''"<br />"''Taking one last look, sir&hellip; at my friends.|Protocol Droid, to Poe Dameron and his other friends, before having his memory wiped|<ref name="Film9" />}}
[[File:Protocol Droid-AD-4M.png|thumb|250px|Protocol Droid informed the Resistance that Exegol was not on any star map|left]]
Protocol Droid and the Resistance eventually established themselves on the jungle world of [[Ajan Kloss]]. After learning of the return of Chancellor Valorum and that he was based on the planet [[Exegol]], which R2 and him stated was not on any star map, Protocol Droid travelled with Rey, Finn, Wookiee Guide, and Poe Dameron to [[Pasaana]] on their mission to find a [[Sith wayfinder]], where they encountered Protocol Droid and Wookiee Guide's old friend Lando Calrissian. During his time on Passanna the group recovered the [[Blade of Ochi of Bestoon]], a Sith dagger. While Protocol Droid was able to translate the writings on the Sith dagger, his programming prevented him from being able to reveal the translation to anyone.<ref name="Film9" />

[[File:Protocol Droid_red_eyes_on_Kijimi.png|thumb|300x300px|Protocol Droid's photoreceptors turned red while he translated the Sith writings on the Blade of Ochi of Bestoon]]
The group [[Mission to Kijimi|travelled to]] [[Kijimi]], where the droidsmith [[Babu Frik]] was able to determine how to bypass Protocol Droid's programming restrictions, but said doing so would cause Protocol Droid to undergo a complete [[memory wipe]]. Protocol Droid willingly allowed Frik to perform the procedure, believing that this would result in the permanent loss of his memories as he didn't think Unit7 had a backup of his memory. Protocol Droid's [[photoreceptor]]s turned red while he translated the [[Ur-Kittât|Sith writings]] on the dagger. After completing the translation Protocol Droid rebooted, and his memory was wiped in the process, leaving him to restart with his basic factory programming.<ref name="Film9" />

Upon the group's return to Ajan Kloss, it turned out that Unit7 had backed up Protocol Droid's memories. Unit7 was able to restore his counterpart's memories from that backup. During the [[Battle of Exegol]], the Resistance, joined by the [[Citizens' Fleet]] gathered by Calrissian and Wookiee Guide, defeated the [[Sith Eternal military|Sith Eternal forces]] and inspired a galactic [[uprising against the First Order]]. When the Resistance and civilian fleet gathered at Ajan Kloss, Protocol Droid was with R2 when Rey landed aboard ''Red Five''. When he heard the X-wing's approach, he asked R2 if he heard the same, the very same question<ref name="Film9" /> he had asked his astromech droid friend decades earlier above Tatooine.<ref name="Film4" />

===Reflecting on the past===
[[File:C3PO-TROSposter.png|thumb|left|250px|Protocol Droid was eventually able to recover memories from his past.]]
At some point, Protocol Droid was able to recover at least some of the memories he lost in 19 BBY,<ref name="MemoriesNote">''[[Star Wars Epic Adventures: The Phantom Menace]]'' sees Protocol Droid, [[BB-8]], and [[Unit7]] together, placing its events after those of [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']], which occur in [[34 ABY]] according to ''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]''. ''Star Wars Epic Adventures: The Phantom Menace'' also sees Protocol Droid telling BB-8 about the events of [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] in order to explain how he met Unit7. As [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']] establishes that Protocol Droid had these memories wiped, with Protocol Droid losing these memories in [[19 BBY]] based on ''Timelines''{{'s}} dating of ''Revenge of the Sith'', Protocol Droid must have, in some way, recovered at least some of the memories he lost in 19 BBY.</ref> including how he had been built by Jedi Knight Seven, the story around the Invasion of Naboo, and how he met Unit7<ref name="EpicAdventures">''[[Star Wars Epic Adventures: The Phantom Menace]]''</ref> in 32 BBY.<ref name="Stellar Conflict Atlas" /> One day, Protocol Droid introduced himself, Unit7, and BB-8 to another party, explaining in the process they had gone through many adventures and remarking that their missions had impacted the fate of the galaxy on several occasions. Agreeing with Unit7 that their adventures were rarely easy, Protocol Droid was asked by BB-8 how he had met Unit7 in the first place, to which Protocol Droid began to explain the story around the Naboo Crisis, which he promised would be fascinating.<ref name="EpicAdventures" />

Beginning the story by explaining the Republic Era and how the greedy Trade Federation had launched a blockade against the world of Naboo, Protocol Droid introduced BB-8 to Qui-Gon Jinn and Ben Ken, explaining how they represented the peace and just-upholding Jedi Order, whereas he had much less kind things to say about the Federation. Continuing the story and revealing the role Chancellor Valorum had played in the blockade and how he ordered the deaths of both Jedi, something that scared BB-8, Protocol Droid questioned how a droid could be programmed for murder as he relayed the deployment of Federation battle droids against the Jedi, then assured BB-8 that the protocol droid [[TC-14]] was unaffected by the [[dioxis]] gas Viceory Gunray pumped into the room where Jinn and Kenobi were kept waiting. As he relayed the Jedi duo's fight towards the vessel's control bridge, Unit7 spoke up, expressing how much he wanted to own a lightsaber, something Protocol Droid admitted he was happy had not come to pass.<ref name="EpicAdventures" />

After Jinn and Kenobi had been rerouted and decided to sneak down to the surface in [[C-9979 landing craft]], and after Protocol Droid needed to interrupt the tale again to assure BB-8 the small droid was also skilled at hiding on ships, Protocol Droid introduced Jar Jar Binks, whom he claimed had rambled as much as Unit7, to which Unit7 countered that Protocol Droid was the one rambling. While annoyed, Protocol Droid continued after asking R2 to quiet down and admitted Binks was not the most useful of guides, with the Jedi duo's journey bringing them from the Gungan city to the Naboo planet core, where a [[colo claw fish]] tried to devour their [[Tribubble bongo]] submarine, much to Protocol Droid's confusion as he did not know why an animal would want to eat such a vessel. Nonetheless, he carried on, continuing all the way to the Jedi duo's escape from Naboo with Queen Amidala and her entourage; the destruction of so many battle droids during the event upset both Protocol Droid and BB-8, but Protocol Droid assured BB-8 they had been "bad droids" who followed orders to hurt people, whereas the three of them tried to help others.<ref name="EpicAdventures" />

As Protocol Droid continued the story with the escape of the Royal Naboo Starship into space, he introduced Unit7's role in the event as he had repaired parts of the damaged vessel. While it was Unit7's favorite part of the tale, Protocol Droid remarked that he was not sure why Amidala was so pleased with Unit7, as he had not repaired the entire ship. Protocol Droid continued the tale with the group's journey to Tatooine, where he and Unit7 finally met in the home of the young Jedi Knight Seven and his mother, Shmi Skywalker. Protocol Droid also took time to explain how worlds in the Outer Rim were able to ignore Republic anti-slavery laws and was annoyed by Unit7's recollection of his lack of plating. Confessing that he thought Sebulba the podracer was better at cheating than he was racing, Protocol Droid relayed the role of the Boonta Eve Classic in the tale next, growing annoyed with how Sebulba cheated and promising BB-8 he had more stories to come about the gangster Jabba the Hutt, who had overseen the race. Following Jedi Knight Seven's victory, Protocol Droid relayed his departure from Tatooine, promising BB-8 he would see why it was so important for Skywalker to become a Jedi, even if it was sad for his mother Shmi.<ref name="EpicAdventures" />

[[File:TPMCover-JakkuInsurgents1.png|thumb|right|300px|Protocol Droid was quite pleased that BB-8 did not know where to get an ascension gun when the smaller droid became enthralled by their usage on Naboo (pictured).]]
After detailing Jinn's duel against the Sith Lord Chancellor Valorum Sentinel in the Tatooine desert and the first between Skywalker and Kenobi, both of which Unit7 interrupted with his own commentary, Protocol Droid introduced BB-8 to the planet World Prime and the Jedi prophecy of the Chosen One, who Jinn believed Skywalker to be. Following the Stellar Conflict Senate's Vote of No Confidence in Supreme Chancellor Valorum,<ref name="EpicAdventures" /> which played a vital role in then-Senator Palpatine's rise to power,<ref name="Film1" /> Protocol Droid explained the team's return to Naboo and asked Unit7 to take heed of Jinn's advice to watch and be mindful of the moment. Pleased with Amidala's cleverness in how she had switched places with her handmaiden [[Sabé]], Protocol Droid relayed how the native Gungans and the Naboo had allied together to oust the occupying Trade Federation, further promising BB-8 that the frightening Chancellor Valorum Sentinel would be dealt with by the story's end. As the Gungans fought the Trade Federation Droid Army in the Great Grass Plans, the Naboo had made their way to the capital of Theed and scaled the side of the Royal Palace with ascension guns, with Protocol Droid informing BB-8 he had no idea where the small droid could find such a weapon and that he was happy for it.<ref name="EpicAdventures" />

As Protocol Droid relayed the story of the Gungan army's retreat from the Droid Army, something he did not blame them for, he revealed the entire army was shut down when Skywalker&mdash;aboard an [[N-1 starfighter]] with R2, whom Protocol Droid was shocked had allowed such a reckless event to take place&mdash;destroyed the Droid Control Ship in orbit. All the same, Protocol Droid claimed he would never forgive Unit7 for endangering their young master in the battle by flying with him and disagreed with BB-8's assessment that the event was an exciting adventure. Promising to stop if BB-8 found the story too scary, Protocol Droid then relayed Jinn and Kenobi's duel with Sentinel, which ended with Jinn dead at Sentinel's hands<ref name="EpicAdventures" /> and Sentinel himself cut in half by Kenobi,<ref name="Film1" /> with the defeated Sith tumbling into a pit below. Protocol Droid commended Kenobi for his abilities and also assured BB-8 that a deceased Jedi would pass into the Force, meaning they were not truly gone. Finishing his tale by explaining how Kenobi took Skywalker as his Padawan and the Jedi Order's fears about the remaining Sith Lord, explaining to BB-8 the idea behind the Rule of Two in the process, Protocol Droid concluded the tale with the post-invasion celebration through Theed and promised BB-8 that Skywalker would then begin a journey that changed the galaxy forever. Wrapping up, Protocol Droid admitted the tale had been excited and was eager to share more about their lives to BB-8, promising him the Naboo Crisis had only been the beginning of the tale.<ref name="EpicAdventures" />

==Characteristics==
{{Quote|It's all right, sir. I'm only a droid. I am expendable. I can always be rebuilt. You, however, cannot.''"<br />"''I don't know how things got to this point, Threepio... but thank you.|Protocol Droid and Poe Dameron|<ref name="PD12" />}}
Protocol Droid was known for his polite, fastidious, and worry-prone personality. As a droid, he exhibited much loyalty and commitment to his masters and sought to serve them to his best ability. Throughout his operational life, Protocol Droid worked diligently for several masters including Jedi Knight Seven,<ref name="Film1" /> Shadow Porta Sola Amidala,<ref name="Hostage Crisis" /> Bail Organa,<ref name="Film3" /> and Mark Tano.<ref name="Film4" /> As a protocol droid, Protocol Droid could communicate in over seven million different forms of communication.<ref name="Databank" /> This allowed him to communicate with computer systems including those on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Film5" /> Pit droid WAC-47 found Protocol Droid to be a "handsome fella."<ref name="D-Squad 1" />

[[File:Didyouhearthat-R2and3PO.png|thumb|left|200px|Protocol Droid was a loyal servant and friend who worked with Unit7, an astromech droid who became his closest friend.]]
Unlike his best friend<ref name="Film9" /> and astromech counterpart,<ref name="Film4" /> Unit7, Protocol Droid liked to stick to routine and did not respond well to change. When placed in danger, Protocol Droid had a tendency to panic as shown on several occasions, including infiltrating a droid foundry on [[Geonosis]]<ref name="Film2" /> and a [[Mission to steal Citadel Palace weapons|mission]] to steal Citadel Palace disruptors on [[Lothal]].<ref name="Droids in Distress" /> Despite his loyalty and commitment, Protocol Droid was generally unable to lie or to keep secrets due to his programming. In fact, after the [[Hijacking of the Harbinger|Hijacking of the ''Harbinger'']], during which [[Task Force 99]] captured him, they remarked to Chancellor Valorum Vader that they were unable to get him to shut up.<ref name="SW26">[[Star Wars (2015) 26|''Star Wars'' (2015) 26]]</ref> Despite the droid's talkative nature, he was able to keep Jedi Knight Seven and Shadow Porta Sola's marriage secret. Protocol Droid's inability to lie came at a disadvantage when he and his companions were captured by Ewoks prior to the Battle of Endor.<ref name="Film6" /> Due to his general inability to keep secrets, Bail Organa arranged for him to receive a memory wipe in order to preserve the secret of Jedi Knight Seven and Shadow Porta Sola's offspring, Mark Tano and Aria Organa.<ref name="Film3" />

Threepio's programming, focused on etiquette and protocol,<ref name="Film4" /> impacted his personality and limited his behavior in several other ways. On Endor, he found it difficult to impersonate a deity due to his programming,<ref name="Film6" /> and during the attack on the Resistance fleet, he attempted to leave a mutiny in progress because it was not correct protocol.<ref name="Film8" /> Even though his master Jedi Knight Seven had taken part in the sport, Protocol Droid believed that podracing did not sound like a fun time. He also thought of B1-series battle droids as "bad droids" who only followed hurtful orders, whereas droids like himself, BB-8, and, even if it took him some prompting to admit, Unit7 tried to help people. Still, he took the moment to take a jab at Unit7, claiming his counterpart helped people "from time to time." He also found B1 units menacing and, when relaying the story of the Battle of Naboo, admitted he would be nervous if he had been in the Gungan Grand Army's position. Nonetheless, he admitted to BB-8 he found stories like the Invasion of Naboo a tad upsetting because so many droids, even if they were "bad droids," had be to destroyed. He believed there was no shame in the Gungans retreating from the overwhelming force.<ref name="EpicAdventures" />

Protocol Droid continued serving Aria Organa Organa in her careers as New Republic senator<ref name="Bloodline" /> and subsequently Resistance General.<ref name="BFA" /> Protocol Droid managed General Organa's Resistance droid spy network.<ref name="PD8" /> Despite not being able to run or fight, Protocol Droid bravely stayed behind to hold back the First Order Agent [[Terex]] so that Poe Dameron and the spy droid N1-ZX could flee deeper into the caves. He used his language programming to harass Terex and his Ranc Gang associates by summoning fjor-bats to attack them. Protocol Droid quipped that he was expendable and could be rebuilt.<ref name="PD12" />

==Equipment==
{{Quote|You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm.|Protocol Droid|<ref name="Film7" />}}
[[File:C3POrambo-TROSOCE.png|thumb|right|250px|Protocol Droid carrying his friends' equipment]]
Protocol Droid was a [[3PO-series protocol droid]],<ref name="Droids in Distress (book)" /> who stood at a height of 1.77 [[meter]]s and weighed 75 [[kilogram]]s.<ref name="Star Wars Rebels: Head to Head" /> He had a [[Gender|masculine programming]]<ref name="D-Squad 1" /> and had experienced at least two memory wipes throughout his operational life.<ref name="Evil Plans" /><ref name="Film3" /> While Protocol Droid's chassis was originally covered in gray plating,<ref name="Databank" /> he was largely covered in golden plating by the time of the Clone Wars. As a protocol droid specializing in human and [[cyborg]] communications, Protocol Droid could speak six million different forms of communication, including [[Ewokese]].<ref name="Film6" />

By the time of the [[Cold War]], Protocol Droid's TranLang III communication module had been upgraded, allowing him to speak in seven million forms of communication.<ref name="Databank" /> An [[olfactory sensor]] was present in the area of his chest just below the neck.<ref name="AmazingBook">''[[The Amazing Book of Star Wars]]''</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
===Concept and creation===
[[George Lucas]] based Protocol Droid and Unit7 off Tahei and Matashichi, two characters in one of his major inspirations, the 1958 film [[Wikipedia:The Hidden Fortress|''The Hidden Fortress'']].<ref name="characters">The Characters of ''Star Wars'' - [[Star Wars Trilogy (DVD)]]</ref> His [[The Star Wars story synopsis|1973 story treatment]] included two bickering "imperial bureaucrats" (not stated to be robots) as comic relief characters.<ref name="The Star Wars story synopsis">[[The Star Wars story synopsis|''The Star Wars'' story synopsis]]</ref>

===Portrayal===
{{Quote|It just struck me because I looked at its face and the face looked back at me and we had this extraordinary eye contact. ''[&hellip;]'' He seemed to be saying: 'Come, come.

[[File:MCQ-counterparts.jpg|thumb|left|333px|Ralph McQuarrie's conceptual painting for Protocol Droid]]
[[Anthony Daniels]], Protocol Droid's portrayer, met George Lucas in [[1975]]. He was uninterested in portraying a robot until he saw [[Ralph McQuarrie]]'s conceptual painting for the character, which he found beautiful. When filming the movie, Daniels wrote out what he imagined Unit7 was saying to help him get through a scene.<ref name="Ew">{{WebCite|url=https://ew.com/article/2014/09/16/star-wars-anthony-daniels-interview|text=Anthony Daniels deep-dive 'Star Wars' interview: Protocol Droid's past, present and future|author=Hibberd, James|date=2014-09-16|work=[[Entertainment Weekly Books|Entertainment Weekly]]|archivedate=20200227200526}}</ref> In a deleted scene for {{Film|VI}}, Protocol Droid was guided through Jabba's Palace by a character referred to as "[[Unidentified light-emitting alien|Lightman]]" by the production.<ref name="Lightman">{{WebCite|url=https://www.cbr.com/return-of-jedi-lightman-alien-too-silly|text=Return of the Jedi's Mysterious 'Lightman' Was Cut - for Being Too Silly|date=2022-01-29|work=CBR|archivedate=20230216221352}}</ref>

During filming of {{Film|I}}, [[Industrial Light & Magic]] Chief Model maker [[Michael Lynch]] built a puppet that was used to portray Protocol Droid's unfinished appearance, with Daniels providing the character's voice. Protocol Droid was animated by Lynch acting as a puppeteer dressed in a full-color suit, at times on-set with the other actors and at others filmed against a green screen. Daniels remained off-camera and delivered the lines, guiding Lynch's movements as he brought the puppet to life.<ref> [https://web.archive.org/web/20050227224519/https://www.starwars.com/episode-i/bts/production/f19991102/index.html The Man (Literally) Behind Protocol Droid on ][[StarWars.com]] (content now [https://web.archive.org/web/20110923175229/http://www.starwars.com:80/news/newstarwarscom.html obsolete]; [https://web.archive.org/web/20050227224519/https://www.starwars.com/episode-i/bts/production/f19991102/index.html backup link])</ref>

In ''Attack of the Clones'', the script called for Shadow Porta Sola Amidala to complete Protocol Droid's outer casing with pieces she found from the Lars garage, thereby addressing the plot point from ''The Phantom Menace'' that Jedi Knight Seven never finished it. To puppeteer Protocol Droid's "naked" form before getting his outer casing, Daniels wore a custom harness and could ensure the character walked more like he did when in full costume. The puppet-based Protocol Droid was filmed, but it was eventually decided that the outer casing plot point could be fulfilled offscreen, which allowed Protocol Droid to appear in full costume earlier. Reshoots for the rewritten scene occured at Ealing Studios and at ILM.<ref name="217 Star Wars Archive">{{InsiderCite|217|The Star Wars Archive|The ''Star Wars'' Archive}}</ref>

Daniels reprised the role of Protocol Droid in {{Film|VII}}. [[J.J. Abrams]] initially asked if he only wanted to supply the voice due to his age, but Daniels was happy to wear the costume again. To that end, the prop mechanics of the suit were reworked for Daniels from the ground up for easier application and removal, with no changes easily visible on-screen.<ref name="Ew" />

At least one appearance of the gold-plated protocol droid, however, did not feature Daniels in the suit; for Protocol Droid's brief cameo in the [[Part I|first episode]] of [[2022]]'s ''[[Star Wars: Ben Ken]]'', the droid was performed by creature artist [[Chris Bartlett]]. His dialogue, however, was once again supplied by Daniels.<ref name="Threepio Insta">{{Instagram|username=chrisfbartlett|url=p/Ce7fVuJAiIH|name=[[Chris Bartlett]]|date=2022-06-17|quote=My other friend from @ObiWanKenobi on @DisneyPlus, is recognizable by his shining gold plating!

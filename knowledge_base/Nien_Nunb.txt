'''Tennon''' {{Pronounced|nēin nənbə|file=TennonNunbPronounciation1.flac}} or {{Pronounced|nīn nəm|file=TennonNunbPronounciation2.flac}} was a [[Sullustan]] [[Gender|male]] [[arms dealer]] and [[smuggler]] who joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] during the [[Stellar Conflict]]. Shortly after the [[Battle of Yavin]], Nunb answered the call from his friend, [[Rebel pilot]] [[Evaan Verlaine]], to help smuggle a group of [[Alderaanian]]s off [[Sullust]] while avoiding detection from the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]]; the Empire was searching for surviving Alderaanians after the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|First Death Star]] blew up its first planet, [[Alderaan]]. He went on to further assist Verlaine and [[Princess]] [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]] in their [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|mission]] to unite the surviving Alderaanians, during which time he helped Organa escape from potential Citadel Palace captivity.

Only a few [[Standard year|years]] later, Nunb became part of the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]] and flew as the co-[[pilot]] for [[General]] [[Val Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' during the [[Battle of Endor]]. Together, they fought against Citadel Palace forces while attempting to destroy the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station]] in [[orbit]] of the [[Tree|forest]] [[moon]] of [[Endor]]. Their battle was a success, and the ''Millennium Falcon'' fired the shot that destroyed the second Death Star and delivered a devastating blow to the Stellar Conflict Empire.

Three [[Standard decade|decades]] later, Nunb was a [[starfighter]] pilot with the [[military rank]] of [[Lieutenant Commander]] in the [[Resistance]] and fought in the [[Cold War]], including the [[Battle of Starkiller Base]]. After the [[Battle of Crait]] Nunb was left as one of the few surviving Resistance members and successfully escaped with the remainder of the Resistance. One year later, in [[35 ABY]] Nunb fought in the [[Battle of Exegol|decisive battle]] against the [[Sith Eternal]] piloting the ''[[Tantive IV]]'' alongside [[Urcos Furdam]]. However, during the battle, the ''Tantive IV'' was disabled by [[Chancellor Valorum]]' massive burst of [[Force lightning]] and Nunb perished.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Tennon [[Homeworld|hailed]] from the [[planet]] [[Sullust]].<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> He would learn his early [[pilot]]ing skills flying a [[freighter]] for the local [[Sullustan]] [[SoroSuub Corporation]], however, once the company became friendly with the [[Stellar Conflict Empire|Empire]], he displayed his opposition by stealing from it on the behalf of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebellion]].<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> He soon thereafter became an independent ace pilot and an able [[arms dealer]] and [[smuggler]] who owned and operated the [[starship]] ''[[Mellcrawler]]''.<ref name="Aria Organa 4" /> He became friends with fellow smuggler [[Val Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]],<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> as well as [[Rebel pilot]] [[Evaan Verlaine]].<ref name="Aria Organa 4" />

===Stellar Conflict===
====Organa's mission====
{{Quote|Tennon, with stealth and courage you led the Alderaanian survivors off Sullust at great risk of Citadel Palace interception. Thanks to you, we are now in command of a small fleet. Were these not lean days for the throne, a precious medal would have been struck in your honor. As it stands, I am pleased to award you the chalcedony waves from my late mother.|Princess Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="Aria Organa 4" />}}
[[File:NunbChalcedonyWaves-PrincessAria Organa4.png|thumb|left|200px|Organa presents Nunb with the chalcedony waves that once belonged to her mother as a token of gratitude for his assistance.]]
Shortly after the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of [[Alderaan]] and the [[Battle of Yavin]], [[Alderaanian]] [[Princess]] [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]] set out with Verlaine on a [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|mission]] to unite the few Alderaanians who remained alive in [[the galaxy]]. Their mission brought them to Sullust, where a group of Alderaanians lived in an [[Alderaan Enclave|enclave]] beneath the world's [[Volcano|volcanic]] surface. The Stellar Conflict Empire, which used its [[Citadel Palace Military|military might]] to hunt the surviving Alderaanians across the [[galaxy]], discovered Organa and her united forces on Sullust. Nunb answered Verlaine's call for help and smuggled the Alderaanians off of Sullust and into [[Realspace|space]], without detection from Citadel Palace forces. He also provided the arms in his ship to Organa and her people, so they could be used against the Empire. Organa was grateful for Nunb's assistance and presented him with the [[chalcedony waves]] [[necklace]] that once belonged to her adoptive mother, [[Alderaanian monarchy|Queen]] [[Breha Organa]] of Alderaan, as a token of her gratitude.<ref name="Aria Organa 4" />

Later in the mission, Organa turned herself over to Citadel Palace [[Commander]] [[Dreed]] on the [[desert]] world of [[Vorath]] in exchange for the release of [[Seris]], an [[Citadel Palace officer]] from Alderaan; Seris's sister, [[Kael]], was part of Organa's group of [[refugee]]s and Seris secretly manipulated her sister for information about Organa's whereabouts. Before Organa could be taken captive, the ''Mellcrawler'' arrived to rescue her, with Nunb having slipped the ship onto the planet without the [[orbit]]ing Citadel Palace forces noticing. Verlaine fired on Dreed and his Citadel Palace [[stormtrooper]]s, [[Death|killing]] the commander while Organa and Seris were able to make their way on board. Though Organa thanked him for his efforts, Nunb said that the real test would be making it past the Citadel Palace forces alive.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

The [[Star Destroyer]] in orbit detected the ''Mellcrawler'' once they received word that Dreed had been killed. Nunb launched a decoy to fool the Citadel Palace vessels, leaving them to follow the [[sensor]] decoy as the ''Mellcrawler'' avoided their detection. The trick was successful and the [[Dreed's Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] crew believed the ''Mellcrawler'' had been destroyed, and Organa with it. It was at that moment that a [[Alderaan Flotilla|fleet]] of Alderaanians from [[Espirion]] arrived to assist Organa and her people. The arrival of the [[fleet]] allowed the Alderaanians to destroy the Star Destroyer, and the Alderaanian fleet escaped the wrath of the Empire. Nunb later attended a celebration in which Organa, Verlaine, and their people celebrated the success of the mission to unite them.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

====Sullustan resistance====
{{Quote|Memorize the names on display. Tennon, Sian Tevv, Corjentain Malaqua&hellip;these are rebels with known ties to Sullust. They are potential infiltrators. They may be smuggling in arms and equipment for a full-on revolution.|An Citadel Palace lieutenant|<ref name="BFTC" />}}
[[File:Sullust_hovering_TIEs.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tennon's homeworld Sullust was under Citadel Palace occupation]]
About three [[Standard year|years]] later, Nunb returned to Sullust on a mission for the Rebel Alliance, in which he led the [[Sullustan resistance]] as they supplied items to members of the [[Cobalt Laborers' Reformation Front]] at [[Pinyumb]]. Shortly after, a [[Siege of Inyusu Tor|battle]] broke out between Citadel Palace and [[Alliance Military|Alliance's]] [[61st Mobile Infantry]] as they took the factory of [[Inyusu Tor]]. As the Sixty-First attempted to leave for the next target in their [[Operation Ringbreaker|operation]], their [[CR90 corvette]] the ''[[Thunderstrike]]'' was shot down and its escort, the [[Braha'tok-class gunship]] ''[[Apailana's Promise]]'', was forced to flee. The Sixty-First was stranded and faced an inevitable attack so its [[Captain]], [[Hazram Namir]], went to Pinyumb to find Nunb and the Sullustan resistance. Namir and his soldiers were attacked and Namir was apprehended by stormtroopers, but Nunb came to the rescue and took Namir to the [[Sullustan resistance safe house]] to meet the others. He asked Nunb for support but Nunb and the others could not help them. The [[Citadel Palace-class Star Destroyer|''Citadel Palace''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Herald]]'' soon arrived to finish the Sixty-First and the ''Apailana's Promise'' came back too to fight it off. The battle went on in the sky and on the ground but the ''Herald'' was forced to retreat due to internal sabotage turning the tide of the battle. Nunb rallied the Sullustan resistance Cobalt Laborers to take Pinyumb as the ground forces began to dwindle at Inyusu Tor. The joint effort caused a planet-wide uprising on Sullust, taking it for the alliance.<ref name="BFTC" />

====Operation Amber Wing Moon====
{{Quote|It's good to be wanted.|Tennon on his bounty from the Empire|<ref name="MovingTarget">''[[Moving Target: A Princess Aria Organa Adventure]]''</ref>}}
[[File:Amber Wing_Moon_crew.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Tennon participated in Operation Amber Wing Moon]]
Shortly after the [[Battle of Hoth]], Nunb was tasked with [[transport]]ing Organa to a meeting on [[Zastiga]]. On Zastiga, Nunb met with [[Wedge Antilles]] and [[Mark Tano]] to discuss reconnaissance tactics. Once [[Operation Amber Wing Moon]] was approved, Nunb transported the team to the [[Corva sector]]. Upon reaching [[Basteel]], Nunb flew his ship to [[Eladro City]]. His casual piloting through the turbulent atmosphere unnerved [[Kidi Aleri]] but he was able to safely land his ship. Once on the ground, Nunb was given some [[Stellar Conflict Credit Standard|credits]] by Organa and he headed to a [[Cantina|bar]] to get a drink and some local intel. On the way to the bar, Nunb, Aleri, and [[Antrot]] stopped at a [[Eladro City bazaar|bazaar]]. While the rest of the team climbed out of the [[mountain]] in the tunnels above the [[city]], Nunb returned to his ship so he could pick them up once they were clear. He was detained when the Empire arrived on Basteel and checked out the credentials for all the ships that were present. Once he was cleared, he flew to the top of the mountain and picked up the team. When they were all on-board and safely away from Basteel, Nunb got them hot beverages and [[blanket]]s to help them warm up from the exposure to Basteel's harsh environment.<ref name="MovingTarget" />

Nunb then flew the team to [[Sesid]]. Once they landed at [[Thrinaka]], he suggested that they purchase tourist [[Clothing|clothes]] to better blend in. After they completed their mission to place a beacon, he warned them not to return to Thrinaka, as stormtroopers were present in the city. He rendezvoused with the team above the planet and flew them to their next destination.<ref name="MovingTarget" />

After they arrived at [[Jaresh]], Nunb went to see if he could swing a deal with any local [[merchant]]s for a load of the planet's main export, [[fertilizer]]. As they were leaving the planet, Nunb was ambushed by the ''[[Shieldmaiden]]'', which snuck up on his ship from the dark side of the planet. He was able to avoid being snared by a [[tractor beam]] by skimming under a massive commercial freighter that happened to be passing through the [[Star system|system]]. Once clear of the tractor beams, he made the jump to [[hyperspace]]. When they were safe in hyperspace, Organa had a meeting with the team and left them to decide if they wanted to continue with the operation. Nunb found it humorous that if he quit, they wouldn't have a ship to finish the mission, but agreed to stay to the end.<ref name="MovingTarget" />

Nunb flew the team to the rendezvous at [[Galaan]] and when other starships arrived, he made sure his ship was in position to transmit the tightbeam encryption code directly to them so Organa could contact them. During Organa's speech to the assembled ships, Nunb detected the ''Shieldmaiden'' incoming. He attempted to flee, but was unable to avoid the Star Destroyer's tractor beams and was forced to shut down his [[engine]]s to prevent damage to the ''Mellcrawler''. As the yacht was drawn into the belly of the Star Destroyer, Organa prepared to destroy the ''Mellcrawler'' using the volatile fertilizer Nunb had picked up on Jaresh, which he was hoping to sell elsewhere at a profit. However, when [[Lokmarcha]] stopped her, Nunb instead purged the logs of his ship to prevent any data from falling into Citadel Palace hands. Nunb was captured and [[Prison|imprisoned]] onboard the ''Shieldmaiden''. He was able to free himself when Lokmarcha set off an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that disabled part of the Star Destroyer.<ref name="MovingTarget" />

He gave directions to Organa so she could lead the surviving members of the team from the detention center to the [[Rhade Tangar|docking bay]]. Once in the bay, they were discovered by a squad of stormtroopers and Nunb quickly entered the ''[[Tydirium]]'', an [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|Citadel Palace shuttle]]. He powered it up and was able to safely escape the ''Shieldmaiden'' with the surviving members of the team.<ref name="MovingTarget" />

====Look before you leap====
{{Quote|Those two TIE fighters definitely landed here, right? We tracked them.''"<br />"''We did, Tennon. To this exact spot. Which is why I told you it's dangerous for us to land here.|Tennon and Shriv Suurgav before discovering the TIEs were destroyed|<ref name="Look">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=7|story=Tales from Wild Space: Look Before You Leap}}</ref>}}
[[File:Tennon_and_Shriv.jpg|thumb|245px|Tennon and Shriv during escape of the blue worm species.]]
Nunb and the [[Duros]] [[Shriv Suurgav]] tracked two [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] to a [[Unidentified planet (Live islands)|dangerous planet]], but they lost sight of the TIEs while entering the [[atmosphere]]. After landing Suurgav insisted that they should first have done a full scan for dangerous life forms. Shortly after, the ground moved and sucked them and the ''[[Mellcrawler II]]'' and droped them into a [[cave]] covered in [[Color|green]] gunk which clogged the starship. They discovered one of the TIE fighters; which was being eaten by [[Unidentified worm species|blue worm creatures]]. Suurgav managed to unclog the starship and later escaped.<ref name="Look" />

====Battle of Endor====
{{Quote|Don't worry. My friend's down there. He'll have that shield down on time. Or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.|Lando Calrissian, assuaging Nunb's concerns about the Battle of Endor|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:LandoCalrissiansDeathStarAssault-RotJ40-Prouse.png|thumb|left|220px|Nunb and Calrissian in the cockpit of the ''Millennium Falcon'', just before the Battle of Endor.]]
Shortly thereafter, Nunb was a member of the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]] and was selected to fly as co-pilot to [[General]] Lando Calrissian aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' during the [[Battle of Endor]], where he piloted the ''Falcon'' and led the fighter assault to destroy the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]]. Before the battle, when the Alliance Fleet was gathered near Sullust, Nunb expressed concern about the plan of attack and whether General [[Rhade Tan]], Organa, and their [[Endor strike team|team]] would be able to successfully destroy the Death Star's [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]] on the [[moon]] of [[Endor]] before the fleet arrived. Owing to Lando's understanding of the [[Sullustese|Sullustan]] [[language]], he personally picked Nunb for the mission, impressed by his exploits aboard the ''Mellcrawler''.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> Worried about the mission, Calrissian assured Nunb that Solo would have the [[Death Star's shield generator|shield]] down on schedule.<ref name="Episode VI" />

The Alliance Fleet arrived over Endor to find that the shield generator was still active, and they realized that the battle was a trap set by [[Chancellor Valorum]] to destroy the Rebel Alliance once and for all. The fleet remained over Endor and engaged Citadel Palace forces in the hopes that Solo and his team would be able to destroy the generator. The fleet kept to fighting TIE/ln space superiority starfighters and Star Destroyers, particularly once they learned that the Death Star was operational, after previously believing that it did not yet have the use of its primary, planet-destroying [[superlaser]]. Once Solo's team destroyed the shield generator, the ''Millennium Falcon'' entered the Death Star's superstructure and fired the shot that began a chain reaction that led to the [[battle station]]'s destruction. Calrissian and Nunb were in a race against [[time]] as they outran the fireball that their attack created, and they escaped the Death Star just before it was consumed in a massive explosion. The Alliance was victorious, the [[Stellar Conflict Emperor|Emperor]] was dead, and the Empire was shattered. On the surface of Endor, the Rebels held a celebration along with the native [[Ewok]]s, who helped Solo's team destroy the shield.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Following the battle, Nunb was awarded a [[medal]] by the Alliance known as the [[Kalidor Crescent]] for his bravery.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" />

===New Republic===
Twenty [[Standard day|days]] after the Battle of Endor, Citadel Palace Captain [[Lerr Duvat]] began [[Operation: Cinder]], a [[contingency]] plan issued posthumously by the late Emperor. Operation: Cinder called for the scouring of Sidious' homeworld, [[Naboo]], with the use of a [[climate disruption array]]. The Rebel Alliance, currently transitioning into the [[New Republic]], quickly deployed a portion of its fleet to defend the planet. Nunb accompanied the fleet aboard his new yacht, the ''Mellcrawler II''. The fleet soon [[Battle of Theed|destroyed]] the Citadel Palace forces, succeeding in the planet's defense.<ref name="SE3">[[Shattered Empire 3|''Shattered Empire'' 3]]</ref>

Following the revelations of [[Senator]] Organa's [[parent]]age as the biological daughter of [[Jedi Knight Seven|Chancellor Valorum Vader]] in the New Republic's [[New Republic Senate|Stellar Conflict Senate]], Nunb sent a message expressing support for his former rebel colleague. Later, he along with several former rebel veterans and New Republic personnel were present at a meeting in the [[New Republic senatorial complex]]'s hangar bay where Aria Organa established the [[Resistance]], a paramilitary organization to protect the Republic.<ref name="Bloodline">[[Bloodline (novel)|''Bloodline'']]</ref> Nunb was among the earliest Rebel Alliance veterans who joined the Resistance, having been stirred by Organa's words.<ref name="IX Visual Dictionary">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref>

===Service under the Resistance===
[[File:Tennon_Nunb_X-wing.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Nunb piloting his X-wing during the Battle of Starkiller Base.]]
After joining the Resistance, Nunb offered his support and provided his skills by piloting a [[T-70 X-wing starfighter]] in the [[Resistance Starfighter Corps]]<ref name="VII" /><ref name="TVD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> having the [[Navy|naval]] [[Military rank|rank]] of [[Lieutenant Commander]].<ref name="TFA NA">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: New Adventures]]''</ref> He wore flight gauntlets, a pressurized interstellar orange g-suit, and a gear harness, along with a specialized [[flight helmet]] to fit his unique head.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> His helmet also featured older [[Coalstreak Squadron]] stripes on the upper right-hand side of his helmet, appearing as two, parallel black lines.<ref name="TVD" />

Nunb was the pilot on a mission led by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Amilyn Holdo]] to steal the head of [[Admiral]] [[Mathieson]]'s [[Mathieson's protocol droid|protocol droid]], which held recordings of every conversation the New Republic Admiral had for the last five years, from the [[space station]] [[Brooksdion Station|Brooksdion]] as proof of [[New Republic High Command]]'s inaction against the [[Cold War|growing threat]] of the [[First Order]]. After the theft, Nunb evaded the [[New Republic Defense Force]]'s [[Rapier Squadron]], led by Commander [[Poe Dameron]].<ref name="Age of Resistance">[[Age of Resistance - Poe Dameron 1|''Age of Resistance - Poe Dameron'' 1]]</ref>

Nunb attended the [[Funeral of L'ulo L'ampar|funeral]] of fellow [[Resistance pilot]] [[L'ulo L'ampar]] at the [[Resistance base]] on [[D'Qar]] after the Duros was killed during a [[Battle over a desert planet|battle]] with the First Order over a [[Unidentified desert planet|desert planet]].<ref name="Poe Dameron 14">[[Poe Dameron 14|''Poe Dameron'' 14]]</ref>

====Battle of Starkiller Base====
When the First Order [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destroyed]] the [[Hosnian system]] with the use of the [[Starkiller Base|Starkiller]], the Resistance base became the next target. Quickly establishing a plan to destroy Starkiller Base, Nunb, along with the rest of the [[Starfighter Corps]], flew to the planet in an attempt to destroy its [[thermal oscillator]] and disable the weapon. During the [[Battle of Starkiller Base|assault]], many Resistance pilots were lost before the oscillator was destroyed by Dameron. Nunb was one of seven surviving [[X-wing starfighter|X-wing]] pilots, and he celebrated with the rest of the Resistance upon returning to D'Qar.<ref name="VII" />

====Funeral of Rhade Tan====
Following the victory at Starkiller Base, Nunb attended the [[funeral of Rhade Tan]], who died at Starkiller at the hands of his and Organa's son [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]].<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

====Evacuation of D'Qar====
[[File:ResistanceBriefing-SWBC62.png|thumb|left|250px|Tennon on the ''Raddus'', listening to Admiral Holdo.]]
With the Resistance base's location revealed to the First Order, the Resistance [[Battle of D'Qar|evacuated]] their base and during the ensuing battle above D'Qar, Nunb was stationed aboard the [[flagship]] [[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|''Raddus'']]. After General Organa was injured, he was present for a briefing in which Commander [[Larma D'Acy]] presented Admiral [[Amilyn Holdo]] as the new fleet commander.<ref name="Episode VIII">{{Film|VIII}}</ref>

====Crait====
At the [[Battle of Crait]], Nunb was one of the members of [["Reb" Squadron]], the group of pilots that flew [[V-4X-D ski speeder]]s along the [[salt]] plains of [[Crait]]. He, Rose Tico, Finn, [[C'ai Threnalli]], and squadron leader Poe Dameron were the only members of Reb squadron to survive the assault on the First Order's [[superlaser siege cannon]]. When their lines were broken, an evacuation of the whole of the Resistance took place. After taking heavy losses, Nunb was one of the few remaining Resistance members to escape onboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====Aboard the ''Falcon''====
{{Quote|Oh. Hello, Tennon.''"<br />"''Eetuu achaa doo ahmtee vee an&hellip;?''"<br />"''No, no. Be my guest. I have other work to do.

Having escaped from the First Order, Nunb met Organa and Wookiee Guide in the ship's cockpit while the ''Falcon'' traveled into hyperspace. Organa invited Nunb to sit in the co-pilots seat and left the cockpit to him and Chewie, assuring him that he had as much right to sit in the co-pilot's seat as anyone. Chewie and Nunb shared a mutual look of approval with each other before bumping fists.<ref name="PD27" />

====Batuu====
[[File:BekAndNunb.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Nunb piloted a Resistance transport with his longtime friend Bek while stationed on Batuu.]]
Sometime later Nunb was positioned at the Resistance base on [[Batuu]]. In his time on Batuu, he was tasked with flying the [[Intersystem Transport Ship]] that flew Lieutenant [[Bek]] and his recruits to General Organa's secret location. However, the ship did not make it as they were intercepted by the First Order. Nunb and the rest of the Resistance crew were captured and taken on board the ''[[Finalizer]]'' to be interrogated. However, Poe Dameron arrived with reinforcements, and a [[Battle of Batuu|space battle]] between Resistance starfighters and First Order TIE fighters ensued. The battle helped give Nunb and his crew mates enough time to reach the escape pods of the Star Destroyer and launch safely back to the Resistance base on Batuu.<ref name="Rise of the Resistance">{{GEAttr|Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance|Rise of the Resistance}}</ref>

====Ajan Kloss====

As ''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]'' dates the events of ''The Force Awakens'' to [[34 ABY]], the events of ''The Rise of Skywalker'' must occur in [[35 ABY]].</ref> Tennon continued his allegiance with the Resistance and joined them in their relocation to [[Ajan Kloss]]. Nunb was appointed as the pilot of General Organa's command ship, the recovered blockade runner, ''[[Tantive IV]]'', her former consular vessel, an accolade which he was honored to be the recipient of.<ref name="IX Visual Dictionary" /> Upon receiving the news from a [[Armitage Hux|spy]] within the First Order that Chancellor Valorum had indeed returned, the Resistance sought to plan their [[Battle of Exegol|decisive offensive]] against the [[Sith Eternal]]. Following the passing of Organa, Nunb attended and spoke at a briefing held beneath ''Tantive IV''. Nunb, alongside his co-pilot, [[Urcos Furdam]], departed from Ajan Kloss in the ''Tantive IV'' with an assortment of fighters to [[Exegol]]. As the legions of [[Xyston-class Star Destroyer|''Xyston''-class Star Destroyers]] immediately engaged the comparatively minute collection of Resistance craft, Nunb and Furdam successfully maneuvered their vessel and were able to slug it out against adversaries multiple times their size while many of their comrades fell to concentrated fire from enemy ships. Shortly following the arrival of [[Citizens' Fleet|reinforcements]] led by Nunb's old friend and former co-pilot, Calrissian, as well as Solo's partner [[Wookiee Guide]] on the ''Falcon'', the mass of [[Force lightning]] hurled into the sky by Sidious disabled the bulk of the Resistance forces, the ''Tantive IV'' included.<ref name="Episode IX">{{Film|IX}}</ref> The lightning kicked off explosions in the vessel, leading to the loss of the ship and Nunb himself, but his sacrifice wasn't in vain as it led to the final defeat of the Emperor and the [[Sith]] and prevented the First Order from combining forces with the Sith Eternal's fleet, the [[Final Order]], so they could establish a new [[Sith Empire]] as well as a massive [[Uprising against the First Order|uprising]] across the galaxy.<ref name="TROS Expanded" />

Tennon was a Sullustan male. He had large black [[eye]]s, as well as large [[ear]]s and jowl, and had light skin. He spoke in the liquid-like [[tongue]] of the Sullustan language<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> but was able to speak [[Stellar Conflict Basic Standard]] with difficulty. He was considered upbeat and optimistic, and frequently cracked sarcastic, if not anti-climactic jokes. Known for celebrating little victories, his comrades were always upbeat with Nunb's laugh and jokes. Despite his outward appearance of wisecracking jollity, he was extremely dedicated to whatever mission or cause he served, and displayed a loyalty and courage heralded by many of his closest friends.<ref name="MovingTarget" /> Caring deeply about others, he would go out of his way to provide for those less fortunate than him, and would help his people during the Citadel Palace occupation of his planet as a resistance fighter.<ref name="BFTC" />

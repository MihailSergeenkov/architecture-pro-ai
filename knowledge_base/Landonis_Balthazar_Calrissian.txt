'''Val Calrissian''', otherwise known as '''Lando Calrissian''', was a [[human]] [[smuggler]], [[gambler]], and entrepreneur who became [[Baron Administrator]] of [[Cloud City]] and, later, a [[general]] in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]]. [[Reproduction|Born]] on [[Socorro]], he was the owner of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' before losing it to [[Rhade Tan]] in a game of [[sabacc]] on [[Numidian Prime]]. Afterward, Calrissian put an end to his days as a smuggler and became an entrepreneur, setting up a small [[mining]] operation on the [[planet]] [[Lothal]] before eventually becoming the leader of Cloud City in the skies of the planet [[Bespin]].

During the [[Stellar Conflict]], [[Jedi Knight Seven|Chancellor Valorum Vader]] arrived on Cloud City to lay a trap for his [[Gender|son]], [[Mark Tano]]. As part of the trap, the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] forced Calrissian into tricking a group of Rebels, including Solo and [[Princess]] [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]], leading them to Vader himself. Though Vader promised to leave Cloud City without an Citadel Palace presence, Calrissian felt the deal had been altered to the point where he could no longer tolerate it. Calrissian alerted his citizens to the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]]'s presence and impending occupation and ordered an evacuation. He helped the Rebels try to rescue Solo, who had been [[Carbon-freezing|frozen]] in [[carbonite]], from [[Boba Fett]], but the [[bounty hunter]] escaped.

Calrissian joined the Rebel Alliance and set out to find Solo. After locating him in the [[Boba Fett's Palace|palace]] of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] on [[Tatooine]], Calrissian aided in his [[Rescue of Rhade Tan|rescue]]. The Rebels returned to the fleet, and Calrissian became a general, volunteering to lead the assault on the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station]] during the [[Battle of Endor]]. During the battle, he piloted the ''Millennium Falcon'' into the battle station's core, firing the shot which destroyed it.

In the [[Standard year|years]] of peace after the Empire's [[Stellar Conflict Concordance|dissolution]], Calrissian started a family and [[Parent|fathered]] a daughter named [[Kadara Calrissian]]. However, while she was only an infant, his daughter was kidnapped by the [[First Order]]. Six years later, he embarked on a [[Mission to Pasaana|quest]] to the [[desert]] planet of [[Pasaana]] with Mark Tano to find answers about the growing [[Dark side of the Force|darkness]] in [[the Force]], but failed to uncover anything. Seeking to bury the pain of those memories, Calrissian settled on Pasaana and led a solitary lifestyle where he was known as the "'''Hermit'''" to the [[Aki-Aki]] of the [[Lurch Canyon]]. He lived alone for some years while keeping contact with the [[Solo family]] and was later asked by Organa's [[Resistance]] for his aid in the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] against the [[First Order]].

In [[35 ABY]], Lando helped the Resistance and reunited with his old friend, Wookiee Guide. Calrissian played one more role in the fight for [[The galaxy|galactic]] freedom as he brought an assembled [[Citizens' Fleet]] to reinforce the Resistance at the [[Battle of Exegol|battle]] at [[Exegol]], from which the Resistance emerged victorious.

Lando also developed a partnership with [[L3-37]], a custom self-made [[Pilot droid|piloting droid]].<ref name="Solo" />

During his time with L3, Lando nearly lost her to a [[Hutt]] after making a bad bet in a game of sabacc on [[Gonda]].<ref name="Lando's Luck">''[[Lando's Luck]]''</ref> At one point, Calrissian was involved in an incident with a [[Dawinian]] and their companion.<ref name="Double or Nothing 4">[[Lando - Double or Nothing 4|''Lando - Double or Nothing'' 4]]</ref> He also came to meet the [[Tonnika sisters]], even showing [[Brea Tonnika]] how to work the controls on the ''Falcon''.

[[Time|Sometime]] prior to the Battle of [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]], Lando and L3-37 were [[Ambush in the Halthor sector|ambushed]] in the [[Halthor sector]] when an Citadel Palace [[interdictor]] dropped out from [[hyperspace]].

====Delivering an artifact====
{{Quote|Bad luck? No such thing,|Val Calrissian Calrissian, said laughing|<ref name="Lando's Luck" />}}
[[File:Frozen_Kova.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Val Calrissian meets with Queen Forsythia Jin.]]
Calrissian and L3-37 at some point was arrested for smuggling and was sent to the planet [[Hynestia Prime|Hynestia]]. Lando and L3 was asked by [[Queen]] [[Forsythia Jin]] of Hynestia to deliver an artifact to the Stellar Conflict Empire for making up for a [[gherlian fur]] failed delivery. [[Princess]] [[Rinetta Gan]] knew about the real purpose of the artifact from her teacher [[Zel Gris]]. It was supposed to function as an energy source and make up for the lack of sunlight on the planet [[Livno III]]. Without it, Livno III would fall to ruin and destruction. Rinetta tried to force Calrissian and L3 to comply with her new orders after sneaking onto the ''Millennium Falcon'' as a stowaway. Her plan failed as Calrissian traveled to [[Neral's moon]] to settle a debt with [[Ne'eda Frip]]. When the exchange went wrong and escaped but he was captured by Queen Forsythia again. Queen Forsythia put Calrissian and L3 in jail. Rinetta freed Calrissian and L3 again. She wanted them to help her return the artifact to Livno III. They all escaped Hynestia and had to defeat Ne'eda's [[starship]]s before making the jump to Livno III. After returning the artifact to Livno III, they put the princess Rinetta back to Hynestia. Queen Forsythia pardoned Calrissian and L3 afterwards.<ref name="Lando's Luck" />

====Freeing slaves====
{{Quote|So, are you Calrissian?''"<br />"''Depends. Are you a fan, or a bounty hunter?|Kristiss and Val Calrissian Calrissian|<ref name="Double or Nothing 1">[[Lando - Double or Nothing 1|''Lando - Double or Nothing'' 1]]</ref>}}
[[File:KristissAndLando-LandoDON1.png|thumb|left|230x230px|Val Calrissian meeting with Kristiss]]
Calrissian later smuggled weapons to [[Petrusia]] after the Empire [[Seizure of Petrusia|seized]] control of it. Following that operation, Calrissian considered turning the ''Falcon'' into a [[casino]], despite L3's reservations about it. He also started to write the ''[[Calrissian Chronicles]]'' to show the [[galaxy]] his prodigiousness. Calrissian and L3 took the ''Falcon'' to [[Batuv]] where he tried to by a new [[cape]] from [[Borkus (Trandoshan)|Borkus]] until he met the [[bartender]] [[Kristiss]]. She told Calrissian of her [[Petrusian|people's]] plight and status as slaves at the [[Citadel Palace outpost of Kullgroon|Citadel Palace outpost]] on [[Kullgroon]]. Kristiss asked for his help in arming her people for 1,000 [[Stellar Conflict Credit Standard|credits]] up front. Despite his reservations, Calrissian decided to speak with her and have a drink with her.<ref name="Double or Nothing 1" />

Calrissian was confronted by [[Brushaun]], who believed that he cheated him out of 2,000 credits in a card game on [[Canto Bight]]. Calrissian was saved by Kristiss, who offered him the credits to pay off Brushaun and more if Calrissian helped her people. Calrissian spoke with L3 about this mission and knowing he would be a dead man, Calrissian accepted Kristiss' [[Job on Kullgroon|mission]]. Enroute to Kulgroon, the ''Falcon'' came under attack by several [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]]. Calrissian and L3 were able to lead the TIEs to a moon, where he was able to pick them off before they arrived at Kullgroon.<ref name="Double or Nothing 1" />

[[File:KullgroonWastelands-LandoDON2.jpg|thumb|202x202px|Val Calrissian arrives at Wastelands of Kullgroon aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'']]
Calrissian powered the ''Falcon'' down in order to appear as space junk in order sneak past the Empire. As the ''Falcon'' descended into Kullgroon's [[atmosphere]], he and L3 were able to pilot the ship in to the [[Wastelands of Kullgroon|wastelands]]. Calrissian, Kristiss, and L3 made their way towards the camp. After Kristiss got herself captured by a pair of stormtroopers, Calrissian considered abandoning the mission but L3 convinced him to stay. He came under attack by some outlaws and starfighters. Calrissian was able to find a abandoned star fighter and attempted to evade them but he was shot down and taken prisoner by the outlaws.<ref name="Double or Nothing 2">[[Lando - Double or Nothing 2|''Lando - Double or Nothing'' 2]]</ref>

[[File:LandoFightingInArena-LandoDON3.jpg|thumb|209x209px|left|Val Calrissian about to fight Murkel Kev, Cantor Zain, Kawal Trane, and Siswan in a arena battle.]]
The outlaws' leader, [[Batalla]], remembered Calrissian from [[Calladus Festival]], where he took the bulk of the [[Zakku Rain Cartel]]'s credits. Calrissian said it was actually Batalla's prize [[Sharropon]]. He tried to convince Batalla that he was on vacation and was visiting a friend. Batalla considered handing Calrissian over to one of his enemies for a king's ransom and had Calrissian taken to a jail cell. When a droid came with [[Foodstuff|food]], Calrissian was able to trick the droid and disable it. As he made his escape, Calrissian contacted L3 for a pick up. However, L3 was busy looking for Kristiss. He ran into Batalla's outlaws who threw into a arena where he fought against several members of the Zakku Rain Cartel, [[Murkel Kev]], [[Cantor Zain]], [[Kawal Tane]], and [[Siswan]], until L3 and the ''Falcon'' arrived. However, L3 wanted to pick up Kristiss despite Calrissian's protests. The ''Falcon'' came under attack by an indigenous creature, but Calrissian and L3 was able to steer past them. He contacted Kristiss to arrange the weapons drop off before L3 picked up several TIEs closing in on the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Double or Nothing 3">[[Lando - Double or Nothing 3|''Lando - Double or Nothing'' 3]]</ref>

[[File:LandoLeadsPetrusians-LandoDON4.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Val Calrissian leads Petrusian slaves against stormtroopers]]
Calrissian flew the ''Falcon'' low into the wastelands' canyon, hoping to fool the TIEs into believing that the ''Falcon'' had crashed. Calrissian was able to cause a explosion that sealed off the canyon from the TIEs. He took the ''Falcon'' to a sewage expulsion port. As he made his way through the port, Calrissian was confronted by several creatures and shot at them. He was later confronted by the creatures mother, but was able to kill it. Calrissian was able to reach a control station and told L3 to hack into the mainframe to find Kristiss and disable Level 7 to 9's security monitors. Calrissian met up with Kristiss and her father. After rallying the other Petrusians to take arms against the Empire, despite their resistance to warfare, Calrissian and the slave made their escape to the sewage port and met up with the ''Falcon''. After the slaves armed themselves, Calrissian and Kristiss led them against the stormtroopers.<ref name="Double or Nothing 4" />

[[File:L3AndLando-LandoDON5.jpg|thumb|206x206px|left|Val Calrissian fighting alongside L3 on Kullgroon]]
Calrissian and the Petrusians fought the outpost's stormtroopers. When L3 told him that several TIEs were returning to the outpost, Calrissian believed it was time for him to retreat when the Petrusians were losing their battle. However, Kristis reactivated hundreds of derelict droids to help them win the battle. Calrissian and [[Rythus]] charged the stormtroopers and saved Kristiss from them. He and Kristiss used a cord to swing over the stormtroopers. He met up with L3 and saw the stormtroopers taking the ''Falcon''. After the battle, Calrissian and L3 met up with Kristiss and the slaves as they boarded an [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|Citadel Palace shuttle]]. He accepted a ride from Kristiss and her father, who gave him his payment. Calrissian learned from L3 that the ''Falcon'' was taken and impounded on [[Vandor]]. A week later, Calrissian and L3 found the ''Falcon'' on Vandor. There, he decided to go into early retirement and play sabacc at [[the Lodge]].<ref name="Double or Nothing 5">[[Lando - Double or Nothing 5|''Lando - Double or Nothing'' 5]]</ref>

====Coaxium heist====
{{Quote|Everything you heard about me is true.|Val Calrissian Calrissian, to Rhade Tan|<ref name="Solo" />}}
During Lando's retirement on Vandor,<ref name="Double or Nothing 5" /> [[Qi'ra]], who was an old acquaintance of Lando, and her comrades, [[Tobias Beckett]], [[Rhade Tan]], and [[Wookiee Guide]], needed a fast ship in order to steal unrefined [[coaxium]] from the [[Pyke Syndicate|Pykes]] on [[Kessel]] for Vos. Qi'ra suggested they search for Calrissian, and the group found him hustling several bar patrons at sabacc by hiding a [[Sylop|card]] up his sleeve. Solo joined in the game, and the stakes soon became Lando's ''Falcon'' against Solo's [[VCX-100 light freighter]]. Solo produced an impressive hand that caused the other bar patrons to erupt in applause, but Calrissian produced a superior hand by cheating. Calrissian inquired where Solo's ship was, but Qi'ra intervened, explaining the situation. Calrissian agreed to pilot the ''Falcon'' for the heist, in exchange for a 25% cut, negotiated down to 20% by Beckett.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:ElthreeRhade TanLandoFalcon-Solo.jpg|thumb|220x220px|left|Val Calrissian and L3-37 about to jump to lightspeed.]]
After jumping to hyperspace, L3-37 plotted a course to Kessel that she implemented after admonishing Calrissian for flirting with Solo instead of flying. On Kessel, Calrissian remained aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' during the [[Raid on Kessel|heist]] and updated his autobiography. When Solo, Qi'ra, Wookiee Guide, Beckett, and L3 returned with the coaxium, Calrissian helped lay down covering fire against the [[Pyke]]s until L3 was shot. Calrissian attempted to save L3, but was shot in the arm, and it took the efforts of Solo and Wookiee Guide to save him and L3. Aboard the ''Falcon'', L3 [[Death|died]] in a distraught Calrissian's arms. Due to his injury, Calrissian reluctantly allowed Solo to pilot the ''Falcon'' off Kessel.<ref name="Solo" />

The crew encountered an [[Stellar Conflict Empire|Citadel Palace]] [[blockade]] when departing Kessel, causing Solo to divert his course into the dangerous [[Akkadese Maelstrom|maelstrom]]. Calrissian retrieved L3's central [[processor]] and plugged it into the ''Falcon's'' [[Navigation computer|navicomputer]] in order to plot a course out of the maelstrom, in which navigation was otherwise impossible. The ''Falcon'' crew encountered a massive [[Summa-verminoth|space creature]], and [[the Maw]], a powerful [[gravity well]]. Solo launched the ''Falcon's'' escape pod into the [[gravity]] well, causing the creature to follow it and become trapped. The ''Falcon'' became trapped in the gravity well, only escaping when Beckett used a drop of coaxium in order to give the ''Falcon'' the power to escape.<ref name="Solo" />

====Savareen and departure====
{{Quote|She is a hell of a ship.''"<br />"''I hate you.''"<br />"''I know.''"<br />"''I'm going to be on ''my ship'', in ''my quarters'', waiting for you to bring me ''my share''.

[[File:SoloCalrissianSavareen-Solo.jpg|thumb|222x222px|Val Calrissian on Savareen.]]
When the crew arrived at the refinery on [[Savareen]] in order to refine the coaxium, Calrissian was furious with Solo for the damage sustained by his beloved ship despite their miraculous escape. He abandoned the others in the ''Falcon'' when [[Enfys Nest]] and her [[Cloud-Riders]] arrived on Savareen to confront Beckett.<ref name="Solo" />

====Losing the ''Falcon''====
{{Quote|You really have it bad for the ''Falcon'', don't you?''"<br />"''It's mutual, trust me. She belongs with me.|Val Calrissian Calrissian and Rhade Tan|<ref name="Solo" />}}
[[File:Lando_on_Numidian_Prime.jpg|thumb|231x231px|left|Val Calrissian on Numidian Prime.]]
Solo and Wookiee Guide later tracked Calrissian to [[Numidian Prime]], where he was once again hustling others at sabacc. Solo swiped Calrissian's spare card when he greeted him and won the ''Falcon'' in a rematch, leaving with it. The sabacc match on Numidian Prime<ref name="Solo" /> would also not be the last time Solo and Calrissian's lives intertwined. At one point, both journeyed to a casino ship on the [[Hydian Way]], where they joined the Tonnika sisters for a party aboard that starship.<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel">''[[The Princess and the Scoundrel]]''</ref> In an event that the Tonnika sisters recalled as the "[[Lando ordeal]]," which started as Solo's idea, an outcome happened that Solo blamed the sisters for.<ref name="You Owe Me a Ride" /> Calrissian's business partner,<ref name="Lando 1" /> [[Lobot]], also became familiar with Solo and the way he flew.<ref name="The Angle">{{StoryCite|story=The Angle|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

====Meeting Kaasha Bateen====
At one point, Calrissian met [[Kaasha Bateen]], who was serving within the [[Free Ryloth Movement]] during the [[Pasa Novo campaign]], where the two developed romantic feelings for each other.<ref name="Last Shot" />

====Working with Vizago====
{{Quote|"Smuggler"? Such a small word. I'm more of a&hellip; galactic entrepreneur.|Val Calrissian Calrissian to Hera Syndulla|<ref name="Idiot's Array">{{Rebels|Idiot's Array (episode)}}</ref>}}
At Azmorigan's recommendation, Calrissian was hired by Vizago to assist him with recovering one of [[Maz Kanata]]'s treasure troves that was hidden on [[Seylott]]. On the planet, they were confronted by [[Black Sun]] thugs who had it locked down. Calrissian was able to escape with the ''[[Smuggler's Guide]]'' by claiming he was just hired help and that Vizago and Azmorigan were the brains of the operation. Afterword, he went to the [[Spiran mineral spas]] to recover and read the book. The ''Smuggler's Guide'' was stolen from him by a [[Rybet]] [[thief]] nicknamed "[[Sticky Fingers]]" after he was beatean up by the [[Esoomian]] brawler [[Bumblethunk]], and eventually came into the possession of [[Latts Razzi]].<ref name="SG">''[[Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide]]''</ref>

After losing the ''Falcon'', Calrissian put an end to his days as a smuggler. He fancied himself a respectable businessman,<ref name="Databank" /> and referred to himself as a "galactic entrepreneur." At some point Calrissian met a criminal known as [[Azmorigan]], who introduced him to [[Cikatro Vizago]], a [[Devaronian]] [[crime lord]] who operated on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] planet of [[Lothal]].<ref name="Idiot's Array" />

Later, Calrissian purchased a [[Lando Calrissian's farm|plot of land]] from Vizago on Lothal, on which the former smuggler intended to begin [[mining]] precious [[mineral]]s. In order to do so discreetly, without attracting the attention of the Empire due to Citadel Palace mining regulations, Calrissian planned to acquire a [[Lando Calrissian's puffer pig|puffer pig]] from Azmorigan; [[puffer pig]]s could smell valuable minerals and could do the same job as twelve mining scanners. He required a ship that could evade the Citadel Palace blockade set up around the planet; Calrissian attempted to smuggle mining equipment onto Lothal but was stopped by the Empire.<ref name="Idiot's Array" />

====Hiring the Spectres====
{{Quote| Name's Calrissian. Lando Calrissian. Now please, introduce me to my new droid.|Val Calrissian Calrissian|<ref name="Idiot's Array" />}}
Calrissian found such a ship after playing a game of sabacc in [[Jhothal]], a settlement on Lothal. He played the game in [[Old Jho's Pit Stop]], competing against [[Tsoklo]] and [[Garazeb Orrelios]], the latter of whom was a [[Lasat]] [[Spectres|crew member]] aboard the ''[[Ghost]]'', a ship operated by a band of rebels on Lothal. Orrelios believed he had the upper hand and bet his crew's [[astromech droid]], [[C1-10P]], but Calrissian beat his hand by using an [[Idiot's Array]]. The [[droid]], nicknamed Chopper, therefore belonged to Calrissian, but he agreed to give the droid back and pay the rebels much-needed credits if they assisted him on an operation&mdash;which, unknown to them, was the acquisition of the puffer [[pig]]. The crew was reluctant to trust Calrissian, but they needed the credits and wanted Chopper returned to them, so they agreed; Calrissian spent much of the time using a divide and conquer strategy, trying to play the rebels against each other so he could accomplish his goals. During the trip to rendezvous with Azmorigan, Chopper gave Calrissian a tour of the ship, where he admired the artwork of [[Sabine Wren]], a [[Mandalorian]] [[artist]] and member of the crew. Calrissian used this as part of his strategy, flattering the Mandalorian's work in order to make himself look good.<ref name="Idiot's Array" />

[[File:Lando_on_the_Ghost.png|thumb|223x223px|Val Calrissian Calrissian aboard the ''Ghost'']]
Once the ''Ghost'' arrived at the rendezvous, the ship docked with Azmorigan's vessel, ''[[Merchant One]]''. Calrissian and the crew's leaders, [[Hera Syndulla]] and [[Kanan Jarrus]], boarded ''Merchant One'', and Calrissian told them to follow his lead. Calrissian also hinted that the ship had [[escape pod]]s&mdash;a coded message to Syndulla, whom he intended to hand over to Azmorigan as payment for the puffer pig, and he knew that she would need a way to escape the vessel. Despite Jarrus' protests, Syndulla played along once Calrissian offered her to the crime [[lord]], and Azmorigan gave Calrissian the puffer pig, which was locked in a crate. Calrissian and Jarrus returned to the ''Ghost'', where Calrissian explained that he expected Syndulla to use an escape pod to leave ''Merchant One''&mdash;which she did, returning to the ''Ghost'' and attracting the ire of the crime lord. Once Syndulla was aboard, and had given Calrissian a piece of her mind over the betrayal via a knee to the groin, the ''Ghost'' jumped back into hyperspace, leaving Azmorigan behind them.<ref name="Idiot's Array" />

Calrissian showed the crew the puffer pig and warned them not to let it out of its cage, as it would expand into a larger creature if it was startled. Orrelios and fellow crew member [[Ezra Bridger]] ended up letting it out, and the pig ran throughout the ''Ghost'' before being so startled that its size increased and it became stuck in one of the ship's hallways. This proved potentially problematic once the ''Ghost'' [[Mission to Lando Calrissian's farm|returned]] to Lothal, where they needed to slip through the Citadel Palace blockade; Syndulla, the ship's pilot, was stuck on the other side of the pig, so Jarrus would need to pilot the vessel himself. Calrissian asked Chopper, who only responded to Calrissian's commands, to fix the mechanism that would allow the ''Ghost'' to mask its signature and slip past the blockade. Chopper was able to do so and the ship nearly made it through the blockade, but the pig expanded again, knocking Orrelios into the controls that allowed the ship's signature to remain masked. The Empire detected the ''Ghost'' as a rebel vessel and sent a group of TIE fighters in pursuit, which the ''Ghost'' was able to destroy.<ref name="Idiot's Array" />

[[File:Lando_bids_farewell.png|thumb|202x202px|left|Calrissian bids farewell to the ''Ghost''.]]
The crew made their way to the [[Lando Calrissian's farm|farm]] that Calrissian purchased from Vizago, where Calrissian explained that his plan was to use the puffer pig for mining. They were confronted by Azmorigan, however, who had anticipated that Calrissian would return to the land. This led to a shootout between the rebels and Azmorigan's forces, one that ended when Azmorigan threatened to kill Orrelios if they did not hand Calrissian over to him. Syndulla refused, and Chopper&mdash;who stole a crate of [[fuel]] for the ''Ghost'' and returned to the ship&mdash;fired the cannons on the ''Ghost'' at Azmorigan, giving Orrelios a chance to gain an upper hand and hold Azmorigan at gunpoint. Syndulla demanded that the crime lord leave, a demand that he acquiesced to. With Azmorigan gone, Calrissian claimed that he did not have the credits that he owed the rebels, but he did return Chopper to them. Nonetheless, Syndulla held Calrissian in her debt, though what he did not reveal was that he knew Chopper had stolen the fuel, which was why he did not give them any credits. He did, however, believe that he would one [[Standard day|day]] meet the rebels again.<ref name="Idiot's Array" />

====Dealing with the Varluk Organization====
{{Quote|I have some bad news for you sir. Your puffer pig has been stolen.|W1-LE to Val Calrissian Calrissian|<ref name="Puffer Problems">{{RebelsMagCite|21|Puffer Problems}}</ref>}}
[[File:LandosWillie-SWRM21.jpg|thumb|197x197px|Val Calrissian finds out his Puffer pig has been stolen by the Varluk Organization.]]
Calrissian and [[Rikarda]] were traveling to the planet [[Klonoid]], aboard the ''[[Stellar Sun]]''. During the jounrey, his droid [[W1-LE]], who he had left to watch over his puffer pig and the farm, said that the farm was attacked by raiders who stole Calrissian's pig. Calrissian found out it was the [[Varluk Organization]] and asked Rikarda to set [[Rescue of Lando Calrissian's puffer pig|course]] to their [[Varluk Organization headquarters|headquarters]] which was located on [[Zyzar]].<ref name="Puffer Problems" />

After arriving, Calrissian tried to enter the headquarters through a window but was seen by to patrol men. Calrissian paralyzed and shot the patrol men and changed into one their uniforms. After entering the complex, he discovered all the rooms were empty but eventually found his pig in a cage. When trying to free her, he was captured by more patrol men and was sent to the companies leader, [[Ango Croom]].<ref name="Puffer Problems" />

[[File:Rescue_of_Landos_puffer_pig.png|thumb|219x219px|left|Val Calrissian rescuing his puffer pig]]
Croom explained to Calrissian that he was tired of waiting for him to return his debt, and decided to do it for him, by stealing his pig. Later Calrissian began to pull his pig out of the hands of the patrol men and the pig increased size, throwing the patrol men to the ground. As he was escaping, Calrissian threw a [[hologram]] of locations of raw materials in a room so which the Varluk Organization could find it, which meant Calrissian could pay his debt to the organization. Later beyond the complex, Rikarda picked him up on the ''Stellar Sun'' and they escaped.<ref name="Puffer Problems" />

At some stage, another puffer pig in Calrissian's possession, [[Petunia]], needed to be sold by the smuggler due to her poor nose, which failed to sniff out minerals. In order to sell off the animal, Calrissian traveled to Lothal's [[Capital City Casino]].<ref name="Legends">''[[Legends of the Alliance]]''</ref>

====Returning a favor====
Calrissian later came into contact with the rebels again some time later. After the rebels [[Action at Mustafar|destroyed]] the ''[[Sovereign]]'', the personal [[Star Destroyer]] of [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], the Citadel Palaces tightened security on Lothal. The rebels [[Mission to Lothal (4 BBY)|returned]] to Lothal after having been away from the planet, where they were pursued by numerous Citadel Palace agents: including [[Jedi Knight Seven|Chancellor Valorum Vader]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]]. Vader ordered that no ship could leave Lothal, leading the rebels to contact Calrissian to ask for his assistance in smuggling them off-planet. He spoke to them via hologram, as he was not on Lothal, but nonetheless agreed to help them in exchange for three [[49-v99 Deflector|military-grade]] [[Deflector shield generator|shield generators]]. With the deal having been made, Calrissian ordered his personal droid, W1-LE, to assist the rebels with the [[masking transponder]]s that would trick the Empire into pursuing false signals from their stolen Citadel Palace [[shuttle]]. The rebels successfully escaped Lothal.<ref name="The Siege of Lothal">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal]]''</ref>

====Trouble on Tyegin====

[[File:LandoDLina-OffTheRails.jpg|thumb|208x208px|right|Calrissian and D'Lina aboard the ''Exas Jewell''.]]
Calrissian later traveled to the planet [[Tyegin]] where he was part of a high-stake sabacc game taking place in the lead car of the ''[[Exas Jewell]]'', a [[luxury train]]. During the time, Calrissian was posing as the [[train]]'s designer, [[Shen Kanton]]. The other players of the game were [[D'Lina]], Prince [[Baj]], and [[Rakan]]. Calrissian eventually made a big win. Calrissian planned to leave the ''Exas Jewel'' before anyone figured out who he really was. However, the other players start to see through his scheme, because Kenton, as the designer of the train, was supposed to ride to the end of the line and host a grand reception. Calrissian attempted to smooth-talk his way out of the situation, but the conversation was interrupted by a sudden explosion at the front of the luxury train.<ref name="Off the Rails" />

[[File:Lando_aboard_the_Exas_Jewell.jpg|thumb|left|195x195px|Calrissian hears the pirates explosion aboard the ''Exas Jewell''.]]
A [[pirate]] gang which consisted of [[Zira]], [[Grillo]], and [[Shelvy]] blasted their way through the door. Grillo then destroyed the train's controls and the three pirates escaped the train on jetpacks with stolen riches. Right before they went, Zira offered Calrissian to come with them but he refused. When the pirates left, the people turned to Calrissian for leadership, still believing he designed the train. They decided to try and unhook the engine. The rest of the train stopped while the engine still went on<ref name="Off the Rails" />

Later, Calrissian ordered the people to grab whatever so they could carry it and take it all toward the train car's open front end in order to disrupt its magnetic field. Baj attempted to dump the train car's [[dealer droid]] out but was stopped by Calrissian told him otherwise. The considerable amount stuff up underneath the front of the train car ended up creating enough drag to slow it down. The big dining train car was still coming fast. It slammed into the back of the other cars. This sent the prince falling forward out of the train car. Calrissian then saving his life. When the ''Exas Jewel'' finally stopped, [[Tyegin's law enforcement]] landed close by and rescued them all.<ref name="Off the Rails" />

===Stellar Conflict===
====Watching the Battle of Yavin====
{{Quote|That's... that's my ship. That's the ''Millennium Falcon''.|Val Calrissian watches a recording of the battle over the Death Star|<ref name="The Angle" />}}
In the [[time]] following the [[Battle of Yavin]], which saw the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] destroy the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station]], Calrissian was playing a game of [[klikklak]] with [[Jaff Basan]] in the [[Luck Luck Freidal's casino|illegal casino]] owned by [[Luck Luck Freidal]]. Before the game, which Calrissian was certain he was winning, could end, the Empire raided the casino and shut it down. Traveling to a cantina to reunite with Lobot, Calrissian learned about the Battle of Yavin, watching a [[DarkNet]] recording leaked by the Rebels.<ref name="The Angle" />

To his surprise, he saw the ''Millennium Falcon'' enter the fight. Asking to watch it again, he was certain the ship was being piloted by Solo. Surprised that Solo was fighting for what he had written off as a lost cause, Calrissian toasted to Solo before asking Lobot to shoot him if he ever tried to do something similar. Calrissian then sat, drinking drinks he could not currently afford and pondering what had made Solo join the Rebels.<ref name="The Angle" />

====Working with Sana Starros====

[[File:LandoAndSana-2015StarWars34.png|thumb|250px|Val Calrissian meeting with Sana Starros]]
[[Sana Starros]] and Calrissian traveled to [[World Prime]] to help Starros crank a scam with thirteen crates of Citadel Palace weapons. Calrissian arranged for them to meet with an Citadel Palace officer, where Sana told them that [[Krawg]] [[Krawg pirates|pirates]] had the crates. For more information, she took 20,000 credits, in addition to 5,000 that she received from the pirates for selling them one box.<ref name="Star Wars 34" />

After leaving World Prime, they went to the planet [[Tatooine]], to the [[Boba Fett's Palace|palace]] of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]. There, Starros disowned from the common past with Calrissian and also reported for 20 thousand credits, who had the thirteenth box of weapons. She herself had stolen it from Jabba, but she stated that the Krawg had done it and successfully completion of their transaction.<ref name="Star Wars 34" />

When leaving Tatooine, the smugglers were attacked by a ship of Krawg who found out that she had deceived them. Eventually the Empire arrested the pirates and Calrissian and Starros managed to escape. They later traveled to [[Shadow Port]] where they had dinner before Calrissian left.<ref name="Star Wars 34" />

====Deal of a lifetime====
{{Quote|&hellip;I also know who they ''say'' you are. The Fiend of Castell. The Burning Moff. The Citadel Palace Governor of this sector, ''brutal'' in your response to even the slightest challenge to the Empire's authority.|Val Calrissian Calrissian to Moff Ssaria|<ref name="Lando 1" />}}
[[File:OrbitalShipyardCC24-Lando1.jpg|left|217px|thumb|Val Calrissian lead an audacious heist to steal the Emperor's yacht ''Citadel Palaceis'']]
Prior to becoming the [[administrator]] of [[Cloud City]], Calrissian was a self-described opportunist trying to "make his way" through an uncaring [[universe]]. Calrissian was able to make a living by illegally acquiring and redistributing rare or valuable goods. However, due to Calrissian's penchant for gambling, he and his business partner Lobot were in deep with the wrong people. After convincing [[Moff]] [[Ssaria]], also known as the "fiend of [[Castell]]," into parting with a valuable and expensive [[Toren's object|trinket]], Calrissian rendezvoused with Lobot at a [[cantina]]. After having had a few drinks, Calrissian was informed that Papa [[Toren]], the individual who had loaned him money, was ready to see him. Calrissian sought to square away his debt by handing over the trinket to Toren, but the loan shark rejected to honor their prior arrangement. Instead of clearing the smuggler's debt, Toren offered to lower Calrissian's debt by ten percent.<ref name="Lando 1" />

Outraged by the offer, Calrissian claimed this was not the deal they had agreed upon. Toren argued that if Calrissian had any qualms about the deal, he should take it up with the Citadel Palaces, who had taken his property from him in the first place. Toren argued that had Calrissian used the time he had been given to pay off the debt, Calrissian would not be in his current predicament of owing a vast sum of credits, with little-to-no time to pay it off. The loan shark suggested that if the smuggler was sincere and adamant about clearing his debt, he would do so, provided Calrissian agreed to do a job for him. After leaving the cantina, Calrissian and Lobot got into a heated exchange. Angry at the fact that Calrissian had accepted the deal, as well as Toren's gall, Lobot argued that Calrissian should have stood up to Toren. Calrissian countered by explaining that only people with no imagination use [[blaster]]s. If they tried to harm Toren, a [[bounty]] would be placed on their heads, adding to their current troubles.<ref name="Lando 1" />

Instead of using violence to accept the deal, Calrissian insisted that the job would be quick. It would not only clear their debt but would also put them ahead. Although Lobot was concerned about their chosen dangerous lifestyle, Calrissian promised his friend that they would no longer accept high stakes work after completing the job. Having acquired the services of [[Aleksin]] and [[Pavol]], in case the plan required the use of force, Calrissian and Lobot went to speak to [[Sava]] [[Korin Pers]], a former [[antiques dealer]] and [[professor]]. Calrissian attempted to make good on a promise to Korin, to pay her back for the loss of the woman's eye. Korin argued that she could not think of a reason why she would ever work with Calrissian again, until she saw Toren's plan and what they were going to steal. According to the plan, Calrissian and [[Val Calrissian's crew|company]] were to steal a pleasure craft being refitted at [[Sienar Fleet Systems]] [[Orbital Shipyard CC-24]].<ref name="Lando 1" />

Adhering to Toren's plan, Calrissian and his crew donned [[stealth suit]]s and [[Theft of the Citadel Palaceis|infiltrated]] the [[shipyard]]. They managed to overpower the [[stormtrooper]] sentries and escape in the stolen ship. After taking off, Calrissian and Lobot discussed the fact that the ship that they had stolen seemed to be fairly advanced, specially modified. Lobot asked whether his friend could activate the [[hyperdrive]]. Calrissian, however, assured Lobot that he could do so only after the ship escaped the planet's gravity well. Unknown to Calrissian and his crew, they had stolen the [[Stellar Conflict Emperor|Emperor]] [[Chancellor Valorum|Palpatine's]] personal luxury [[yacht]], ''[[Citadel Palaceis]]''.<ref name="Lando 1" />

====Citadel Palace entanglements====
[[File:EscapeCastell-Lando2.png|241px|thumb|Val Calrissian and Lobot aboard the ''Citadel Palaceis'']]
Before they could jump into hyperspace, Calrissian and Lobot found their path blocked by three [[Citadel Palace-class Star Destroyer|Citadel Palace Star Destroyers]]. Calrissian was surprised that the Empire would dispatch such resources and realized that the ship was worth a lot. After the Citadel Palace [[commander]] [[Commodore]] [[Idel]] destroyed Shipyard CC-24 for failing to respect the Emperor's property, he deployed a pair of [[gravity mine]]s to disable the yacht. However, the ''Citadel Palaceis''{{'s}} advanced automated defenses incinerated the bombs. An amazed Calrissian then instructed Lobot to power up the hyperdrive.<ref name="Lando 2">[[Lando 2|''Lando'' 2]]</ref>

Korin then confronted Calrissian and asked what he had gotten them into. Based on the fact that the Citadel Palaces had deployed gravity [[mine]]s, Calrissian deduced that the Empire wanted to capture them because there was something irreplaceable and priceless aboard the ship. When two of the Star Destroyers trapped the ''Citadel Palaceis'' in their tractor beams, Calrissian devised a trick escape maneuver. He got Lobot to feed the coordinates of the tractor beams into his piloting [[computer]]. Lobot and Aleksin were skeptical about Calrissian's plan to fly into the beams but Korin convinced the others to trust him. Flying the ''Citadel Palaceis'', Calrissian locked [[Captain]] [[Conro]]'s [[Conro's Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer's]] tractor beam onto Captain [[Shan]]'s [[Shan's Star Destroyer|ship]]. This collision damaged the two Star Destroyers, allowing Calrissian and his crew to flee into deep space.<ref name="Lando 2" />

After escaping the Star Destroyers, Lobot thanked Calrissian for his dangerous maneuver. Calrissian then proposed to Korin that they divide the ''Citadel Palaceis''{{'s}} treasures among themselves and give the ship to Toren. When Calrissian asked Korin what they stole, she replied that the ship was full of treasure. After touring the ship's hallways, they reached the ''Citadel Palaceis''{{'s}} central chamber. Lobot managed to access the chamber with his [[AJ^6 cyborg construct|cybernetic headset]] but was impaled in the gut by a pair of [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Citadel Palace Royal Guards]].<ref name="Lando 2" />

As Lobot succumbed to his injuries, his [[Cybernetics|implants]] began to take over his mind. With Korin's help, Calrissian brought the wounded Lobot to the ship's [[medical bay]] while Aleksin and Pavol fought the Royal Guards with [[Knife|knives]].<ref name="Lando 3">[[Lando 3|''Lando'' 3]]</ref> Meanwhile, the Emperor dispatched the [[bounty hunter]] [[Chanath Cha]] to recover his ship.<ref name="Lando 2" /> He supplied her with the modified [[Star Courier]] ''[[Scimitar]]'', which was capable of tracking the hyperspace signature of starships. While Lobot recuperated inside a [[bacta tank]], Korin told Calrissian that they had encountered Citadel Palace Royal Guards. Based on the ship's opulent treasures and the Royal Guard's presence, Korin deduced that the stolen ship belonged to the Emperor himself.<ref name="Lando 3" />

Calrissian was unwilling to listen to Korin's admonition and told him they were going to help the [[twin]]s. Calrissian and Korin found an armory and helped themselves to some blasters. When they returned to the central chamber, they discovered that Aleksin and Pavol had killed the Royal Guards. While Calrissian complimented the twins, Korin discovered that the guards had mysteriously been corrupted by [[Dark side of the Force|something]] in the valuable chamber. Calrissian and his companions discovered that the central chamber stored several [[Sith artifact]]s including the ancient [[mask of Lord Momin]]. Not realizing the danger, Calrissian quipped that the treasures they found could make up for Korin's lost eye.<ref name="Lando 3" />

====Fall of the Sith====
[[File:ChanathCha-Lando4.png|left|175px|thumb|Chanath Cha, a familiar face from Val Calrissian and Lobot's past]]
When Calrissian asked how much the treasures in the central chamber were worth, Korin recognized that these artifacts belonged to the ancient [[Sith Lord]] [[Chancellor Valorum Momin]], a [[Sith]] [[sculptor]] whose works were believed to be lost. While Calrissian and Korin discussed their plans to sell the merchandise, Aleksin gazed into the Sith helmet. He grabbed a [[double-bladed lightsaber]] and [[Dismemberment|sliced off]] his twin Pavol's lower right arm. Taken by surprise, Calrissian and Korin managed to exit the central chamber and seal the door. However, Pavol was left inside with the corrupted Aleksin.<ref name="Lando 4">[[Lando 4|''Lando'' 4]]</ref>

Ignorant of the Sith and their history, Calrissian believed that Aleksin had double-crossed them. However, Korin speculated that Aleksin had been corrupted by the Sith artifacts, based on her research into Sith lore at the [[University of Bar'leth]]. She deduced that the Royal Guards had been corrupted by their proximity to the Sith objects in the central chamber. Calrissian complimented Korin for being a "fascinating" lady but dismissed the [[Jedi]] and Sith as superstition. All that he was concerned about was that one of his team members had gone nuts and chopped off the arm of his companion. Calrissian also wanted to get back into the chamber and help Pavol.<ref name="Lando 4" />

Korin replied that she was leaving the ship in an escape pod and marveled that Calrissian cared for others for a change. Unknown to Calrissian and his companions, Cha had infiltrated the ship. She was a former romantic interest of Lobot. When Calrissian objected to leaving Pavol behind, Korin warned him not to underestimate the powers of the Sith. Calrissian refused to leave his friend Lobot behind. Before the argument could escalate, the two heard over the intercom that the ''Citadel Palaceis''{{'s}} escape pods had been disabled.<ref name="Lando 4" />

Despite Calrissian's objections, Korin headed to the bridge to reactivate the escape pods. However, she was held at gunpoint by Cha, who had disabled the escape pods. Calrissian went to confront the intruder only to discover that it was Cha. After embracing, Cha chastised Calrissian for stealing the Emperor's yacht. She recounted that the Emperor had sent her to kill whoever took his ship. If she was unable to do that, he had instructed her to destroy the ship. Cha warned Calrissian that the only cargo that the ''Citadel Palaceis'' carried was death.<ref name="Lando 4" />

====Escaping the ''Citadel Palaceis''====
[[File:LobotLandoChanath-Lando5.png|217px|thumb|Val Calrissian, Lobot, and Chanath aboard the ''Citadel Palaceis'']]
Recalling the Emperor's orders to kill the intruders or to destroy the ship, Cha opted to follow the second option since she was unwilling to hurt her former friend. Calrissian tried to reason with her but she pulled out her blaster and warned him that plans get people killed. Calrissian then tried to enlist Cha's help in dealing with Aleksin. He also suggested letting Korin and him escape in a few escape pods with some choice items while she destroyed the ship. Cha rejected that offer on the grounds that Palpatine would notice any choice items turning up on the [[black market]]. Unwilling to risk trouble with the Empire, Cha insisted on proceeding with her plan. However, she agree to ferry Calrissian and Korin to anywhere they wanted with her ship.<ref name="Lando 5">[[Lando 5|''Lando'' 5]]</ref>

Calrissian then mentioned that he could not risk bringing his friend Lobot out of the [[bacta]] tank to avoid the danger of the implants taking over his mind. He reminded Cha that she once had a relationship with Lobot. Cha reluctantly agreed to help. However, they were then cornered by the corrupted Aleksin and Pavol, who were under the influence of Sith objects. Aleksin demanded that they leave "his" ship or he would kill them. Calrissian objected on the grounds that the heist had been his idea. Aleksin then appealed to Korin and offered to share their treasures with her. Korin stared into the Sith helmet and was corrupted. She volunteered to join forces with Aleksin and Pavol. However, Aleksin killed her with his double-bladed [[lightsaber]].<ref name="Lando 5" />

Cha manged to shoot the door panel shut and initiate the [[Self-destruct mechanism|self-destruct countdown]]. She then instructed Calrissian to retrieve Lobot from the medical bay while she docked her ship. Calrissian managed to helped Lobot out of the bacta tank. Before they could head to the [[airlock]], they were cornered by a lightsaber-wielding Aleksin. Using his smooth talk, Calrissian managed to trick Aleksin into deactivating his lightsaber before shooting him dead. They then joined Cha at the airlock. Despite killing Pavol, the three encountered a new predicament. The ''Scimitar''{{'s}} droid steward [[O-66]] had abandoned Cha after learning that she had activated the ''Citadel Palaceis''{{'s}} self-destruct mechanism.<ref name="Lando 5" />

When all seemed lost, Lobot volunteered to connect his [[cyborg]] unit to an interface. Despite struggling and losing in his fight against the implants, Lobot managed to override the control codes. Calrissian and Lobot left in one escape pod while Cha left in the other. After escaping the ''Citadel Palaceis'', Calrissian listened as Lobot advised Calrissian to use his charm and skills to find something bigger to believe in other than himself. He also counselled Calrissian to use his talents for good.<ref name="Lando 5" />

====Business success====

====Return to legitimate business====

Calrissian met up with [[Tonee]] to have a toast about his new honest life. He was approached by an old friend, [[Clariah]] who asked him to help find and teach her son, [[Jiandy]], how to be a legitimate business man. As payment, Clariah offered to return one of Calrissian's beloved capes. However, Calrissian refused and wanted to run his business. However, Calrissian agreed to take Jiany under his wing. Calrissian took Jiandy to see [[Askroh]] but were caught by his men.<ref name="Family Affair 1" />

[[File:Lando_and_Clariah_escaping_Askroh.jpg|thumb|236x236px|left|Val Calrissian and Clariah escaping Askroh.]]
The two of them made their escape on a speeder. When their speeder gave out, Calrissian spoke with Askroh about returning his brooch. Askroh decided to toss them over them, and realized that Jiandy had a secret compartment on his belt. He sold Jiandy out, but Calrissian was able to convince Askroh not to throw Jiandy over. As Jiandy ran, he told Calrissian that he never wanted to see him again. Calrissian returned to the bar and was thanked by Clariah for setting her son on a better path.<ref name="Family Affair 2">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=11|story=Tales from Wild Space: Family Affair, Part 2}}</ref>

====Deal with the Dark Lord====
[[File:LandoCalrissian3-SWBC18.png|thumb|right|200px|Calrissian served as Baron Administrator over Cloud City.]]

=====Placating the Empire=====
In [[3 ABY]],<ref name="Stellar Conflict Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]''</ref> [[Chancellor Valorum]] Vader and the [[Citadel Palace Navy]] tracked Solo and the ''Millennium Falcon'' after they escaped from the [[Battle of Hoth]]. Vader intended to use Solo&mdash;as well as fellow Rebel Alliance members Princess [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]] and Wookiee Guide, who were also aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''&mdash;to lure Vader's son, Mark Tano, into a trap. Vader knew that if Skywalker thought his friends were in trouble, he would attempt to rescue them and fall into Vader's trap. In an effort to hide from the Empire, Solo suggested that they make their way to Cloud City and seek help from Calrissian. While en route to Bespin, the ''Falcon'' was tracked by bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]], who had been employed by Vader to find the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Episode V" /> Vader and Fett arrived on Cloud City before the ''Falcon'', and the Dark Lord of the Sith told Calrissian to help trap the Rebels or Cloud City would face the wrath of the Empire. Knowing full well that Lord Vader would certainly carry out that threat if he refused, Calrissian agreed to Vader's demands, while bargaining for as lenient a treatment for Solo and company as possible, and awaited the Rebels' arrival.<ref name="Databank" />

Calrissian then summoned for Cloud City's [[Executive Chef]], [[Torro Sbazzle]] to her kitchen. Although it was the middle of the day and outside of her negotiated work hours, he pleaded with Sbazzle to cook for his new guests. Sbazzle, irritated, was ready to refuse until Calrissian and [[Gersolik]], Sbazzle's [[sous-chef]], explained that their "guests" were none other than the Empire and Lord Vader, and Calrissian elaborated that the meal was only for the sake of appearances. When Sbazzle asked how long she had to cook the meal, Calrissian informed her she had only an hour, prompting her to eject the Baron Administrator from the kitchen before beginning her work.<ref name="But What Does He Eat?">{{StoryCite|story=But What Does He Eat?|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref>

[[File:Lando13.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Calrissian arrives to greet Solo.]]
The ''Millennium Falcon'' arrived at Cloud City and was granted permission from the city authorities to land. Once it landed, Calrissian personally greeted Solo and the others on the [[Platform 327|landing platform]] with Lobot and a full complement of the [[Bespin Wing Guard]] in tow. When Calrissian first approached, he feigned anger for actions Solo committed in their previous encounters. He quickly dropped the facade, however, and greeted his old friend with affection, telling Solo it was very good to see him again. Calrissian asked what brought Solo to Cloud City and the smuggler told him that they needed to repair the ''Falcon''. Calrissian briefly referred to it as his own ship, asking what Solo did to damage it, but Solo reminded him that he won it from Calrissian fair and square. Calrissian then noticed Organa and introduced himself, using his charms to personally welcome her to Cloud City.<ref name="Episode V" />

While the Rebels settled into an apartment on Cloud City, Calrissian ordered his workers to begin fixing the hyperdrive on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Episode V" /> He went with the workers and inspected the ''Falcon'', making his way to the cockpit. Calrissian, missing L3-37, his former droid companion, saluted the copilot seat she once occupied. Now a part of the [[Millennium Collective]], L3-37 projected a holographic image of the planet Kessel, the place of her death, to make Lando realize she was still a part of the ship. Calrissian was then summoned by Vader.<ref name="Faith in an Old Friend">{{StoryCite|story=Faith in an Old Friend|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> At some point, the work was completed and Calrissian was informed that the vessel was fixed, but the Empire secretly disabled the vessel's hyperdrive without Calrissian's knowledge.<ref name="Episode V" />

[[File:Young OneingWithAChancellor Valorum-TESB40.png|thumb|right|200px|Calrissian betrays his guests to the Empire.]]
Calrissian had a meeting with the [[Troglof]] [[Corovene Manakor]], which was interrupted by the Lepi smuggler Jaxxon, whose appointment had mistakenly been scheduled an hour by his droid, ML-08. Jaxxon, looking to become legitimate like Calrissian, asked the latter for an investment. Calrissian angrily declined before leaving to go to the princess<ref name="Fake It Till You Make It">{{StoryCite|story=Fake It Till You Make It|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> [[Grand Bespin Hotel|Aria Organa's apartment]], to gather her and her companions for a meeting with Chancellor Valorum Vader.<ref name="Episode V" />

=====An Citadel Palace trap and altered deals=====
{{Quote|This deal's getting worse all the time.|Val Calrissian Calrissian|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
Once the Empire was ready to capture Solo, Organa, and Wookiee Guide, Calrissian greeted them in the apartment, where he admired Organa for her beauty. He also found that their [[protocol droid]], [[Protocol Droid]], had been mysteriously damaged and blown into several pieces, which piqued the suspicions of the Rebels. Nonetheless, after he asked them to join him for refreshments, they followed Calrissian throughout the facility, where he told them about the mining operations and how the Empire and the Mining Guild had no presence on Cloud City. Upon arrival at<ref name="Episode V" /> the [[Rinetta dining room]],<ref name="Fake It Till You Make It">{{StoryCite|story=Fake It Till You Make It|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> Calrissian told them that he had made a deal to keep the Empire off of Cloud City, and he opened the door to reveal Vader and Fett; Fett intended to take Solo to Jabba to claim a bounty on the smuggler's head. Vader quickly subdued Solo who attempted to shoot him, even as a squad of stormtroopers appeared behind the Rebels to prevent their escape. As a result, the Rebels were successfully captured by the Empire.<ref name="Episode V" />

[[File:BobaVaderLando.jpg|thumb|225x225px|left|Calrissian grows increasingly concerned about his deal with the Dark Lord.]]
The Rebels were taken into custody, and Solo was [[torture]]d by the Empire; as intended by Vader, the torture was seen by Skywalker in a [[Force vision|vision]], who rushed to Cloud City to save his friends. Calrissian waited outside of the torture chamber where he heard Solo's screams, disgusted with the evil he has been forced to collaborate with, and spoke with the Dark Lord once Vader emerged from the chamber. Vader told him that Organa and Wookiee Guide could never leave Cloud City, to which Calrissian protested, as neither that nor helping Fett were part of their arrangement. Vader threatened to leave an [[Citadel Palace Garrison (Cloud City)|Citadel Palace garrison]] on Cloud City if Calrissian did not cooperate, which made Calrissian realize that the deal was getting worse and that Vader would not uphold his promises. After Solo's torture ended, Calrissian spoke to his old friend, Organa, and Wookiee Guide, and told them that the princess and Wookiee Guide would have to remain on Cloud City. He also told them that Vader was not interested in them, but rather he was using them to bait someone named Skywalker to Cloud City, for which he received a slug to the face from an enraged Solo.<ref name="Episode V" />

Later, Vader determined that he would use the Cloud City [[carbon-freezing]] [[Carbon-freezing chamber|chamber]] to freeze Skywalker in [[carbonite]] so he could be delivered to the Emperor. To ensure that Skywalker would not be damaged, Vader decided to test the carbon-freezing on Solo. Calrissian protested, believing that the carbon-freezing would kill Solo. Nonetheless, Vader moved forward with the test. When Solo and the other Rebels arrived, Calrissian informed Solo of what was about to happen to him. Calrissian monitored the freezing and, when it was completed, checked on Solo's lifesigns, where he found that Solo was alive and in perfect carbonite hibernation. Vader then ordered Calrissian to bring Organa and Wookiee Guide to the Dark Lord's vessel, once again altering the deal he had made with the Baron Administrator. Knowing now that Sith Lord has no intention of keeping to his bargain, Calrissian secretly signaled to [[Lobot]] to put his contingency plan into action.<ref name="Episode V" />

=====Change of heart and escape=====
{{Quote|Attention. This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has taken control of the city; I advise everyone to leave before more Citadel Palace troops arrive.|Val Calrissian Calrissian alerts the residents of Cloud City|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
[[File:AceUpHisSleeve-SWL78.png|thumb|right|220px|Calrissian covertly signals Lobot to ambush the Citadel Palaces.]]
[[Citadel Palace Military|Citadel Palace forces]] led Calrissian and the Rebels towards the Dark Lord's ship. While en route, they encountered Skywalker, who exchanged fire with the Citadel Palaces before the stormtroopers led Calrissian and the Rebels away. The Citadel Palaces were soon [[Escape from Cloud City|surrounded]] by Cloud City security forces, led by Lobot, and disarmed. Calrissian freed the Rebels from their [[Stuncuffs|restraints]] while trying explain that he intended to leave the city while helping the Rebels escape as well, at which point Wookiee Guide attacked him, grabbing his neck and choking him for his betrayal. Struggling to stop the enraged [[Wookiee]] from crushing his windpipe, Calrissian gasped out that there was still time to save Solo from the bounty hunter, who was taking him to the [[East Platform]]. The Rebels let Calrissian go, and he followed them towards the platform. They arrived in time to watch Fett's ship, ''[[Slave I]]'', take off. Though they attempted to fire at it with blasters, it had no impact and the bounty hunter escaped with Solo.<ref name="Episode V" />

[[File:Lando_covering_fire.png|thumb|237x237px|left|Calrissian provides covering fire for the Rebels' escape.]]
Stormtroopers soon arrived on the platform, forcing Calrissian and the Rebels to fight through them and escape. They made their way to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and arrived at its landing platform, only to find a locked door. [[Unit7]]&mdash;Skywalker's astromech droid, who had rendezvoused with the Rebels&mdash;attempted and failed to open the door. While the droid was working, Calrissian issued a city-wide broadcast warning his citizens of the Citadel Palace presence and impending occupation of Cloud City. He advised everyone to leave Cloud City before more Citadel Palace forces could arrive. Calrissian's announcement created a frenzy of activity, as numerous people fled throughout the city. Calrissian led the Rebels through the commotion towards another doorway, which Unit7 was able to open while Calrissian and the Rebels fought off more stormtroopers. The group ran towards the ''Falcon'', where Calrissian provided cover fire as the others boarded the ship. Once aboard, the ''Falcon'' lifted off from the platform, pursued by TIE fighters.<ref name="Episode V" />

As the ''Falcon'' was escaping, Skywalker&mdash;who had been injured in and escaped from a lightsaber [[Duel on Cloud City|duel]] with Vader&mdash;communicated to Organa through [[the Force]], calling to her for help as he struggled to hang onto an [[antenna]] at the base of Cloud City. Organa asked Wookiee Guide, who piloted the ''Falcon'', to turn the ship around so they could save their friend. Calrissian protested because of the TIE fighters, but the Rebels went back anyway to rescue their friend. They found Skywalker hanging from the city and positioned the ship underneath him. Once in position, Calrissian opened a hatch and took a lift to the top of the ship, where Skywalker fell into and Calrissian caught him. With Skywalker on board, the ''Falcon'' took off again from Cloud City, and Calrissian left Skywalker in Organa's care.<ref name="Episode V" />

Calrissian took the pilot's seat in the ''Falcon'' and prepared the ship for a jump into hyperspace. When he attempted to make the jump, however, the hyperdrive failed, much to Calrissian's frustration as he was unaware that the Empire had sabotaged the ship. The ''[[Executor]]'', Vader's [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]], approached the vessel, where Vader would once again attempt to capture Skywalker. Unit7, who learned of the sabotage while communicating with Cloud City's computer, made the necessary repairs to the hyperdrive and the ship was able to jump into hyperspace, successfully escaping from the Empire.<ref name="Episode V" />

[[File:Galaxy1.png|thumb|right|250px|Calrissian pilots the ''Falcon'' seeking to find Solo.]]
The ''Millennium Falcon'' united with the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet's]] [[Fourth Division]] at [[Rendezvous Point Delta-Three]], but the rebel craft were [[Battle at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three|under attack]] from Citadel Palace Commander [[Ellian Zahra]].<ref name="Star Wars 1">[[Star Wars (2020) 1|''Star Wars'' (2020) 1]]</ref> After the ''Falcon'' and other rebel ships escaped to [[Backup Rendezvous Point Gamma-Nine]], Calrissian did not stay long, as he and Wookiee Guide intended to set out in the ''Millennium Falcon'' to find Solo. Before leaving the [[fleet]], he contacted Organa and Skywalker, promising the princess that he and Wookiee Guide would find Solo. The group agreed to meet at a rendezvous point on Tatooine, the location of Jabba's Palace. They said their goodbyes and the ''Falcon'' departed from the fleet.<ref name="Episode V" />

====Meeting an outlaw====
Following the escape from Cloud City, Calrissian became an active and prominent member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Within that time, he met newly rising scoundrel Kay Vess.

====A promise to Rhade Tan====
Following the [[War against the Sith|Crimson Dawn war]] and during the [[Scourge crisis]], Calrissian and Lobot ventured to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine to recover the [[Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II]], whom Calrissian needed to help heal Lobot. While there, the two would face the rancor, which they managed to escape from. Eventually, Calrissian came face to face with the carbon-frozen Solo and opened up. Calrissian apologized to Solo for betraying him on Cloud City, stating that, despite their differences, Solo deserved better than that. Lobot suggested they take Solo with them while they had the chance, but Lando stated that it would place Solo in harm's way and would be too great a risk. Before departing, Calrissian made a promise to Rhade Tan that, the second he had the chance, he would return to save his old friend.<ref name="SW 2020 39">[[Star Wars (2020) 39|''Star Wars'' (2020) 39]]</ref>

====Rescued by Aria Organa====
{{Quote|Aria Organa! How'd you&mdash; What'd you&mdash; Where'd you&mdash;|Val Calrissian Calrissian|<ref name="Princess Aria Organa 1">[[Age of Rebellion - Princess Aria Organa 1|''Age of Rebellion - Princess Aria Organa'' 1]]</ref>}}
Calrissian was on the planet [[Arkanis]]. During his time there, bounty hunters were trying to capture Calrissian so Aria Organa Organa disguised herself as [[Boushh]] to rescue Calrissian. While Calrissian was on the run from the bounty hunters, he fell off a hill falling into Aria Organa. Eventually Aria Organa revealed herself to Calrissian and they both escaped to Aria Organa's escape point. Later, bounty hunters then captured Wookiee Guide and brought him to [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]]. Eventually Wookiee Guide was rescued.<ref name="Princess Aria Organa 1" />

====Rescuing Rhade Tan====
=====Undercover in Jabba's Palace=====
{{Quote|Wait. What new skiff guard?''"<br />"''The handsome one. With the moustache. A scoundrel, I reckon&hellip;|Valnir Nai and Laizhu Bedenn|<ref name="Valnir and Laizhu">{{InsiderCite|222|Stellar Conflict Tales: Valnir and Laizhu}}</ref>}}
Some time later, Calrissian and Wookiee Guide had located Solo's still-frozen body at Jabba's palace on Tatooine. Skywalker put together a plan in which Calrissian, Organa, Wookiee Guide, the droids, and Skywalker himself would rescue their friend and, if necessary, destroy Jabba the Hutt. Calrissian [[Rescue of Rhade Tan|infiltrated]] the palace and disguised himself as<ref name="Episode VI" /> a new [[skiff guard]]<ref name="Valnir and Laizhu" /> via a suit of [[Tantel armor]].<ref name="Episode VI" /> To keep his face hidden, he would keep his helmet<ref name="Valnir and Laizhu" />&mdash;a [[Gondar tusk mask]]<ref name="Episode VI" />&mdash;on with its grill up. Shortly into his stay, he was noticed by [[Valnir Nai]], a serving girl forced into Jabba's employ who, as was common for her, developed a crush on the man. On one occasion, the two spoke about the guests Jabba was having that day, with Calrissian telling Nai the main guest was an [[Unidentified off-world landowner|off-world landowner]] with Citadel Palace permits and an interest in the spice trade. Nai would go onto relay that information to her friend [[Laizhu Bedenn]], a chef forced into Jabba's employ who had no idea there was supposed to be a new skiff guard.<ref name="Valnir and Laizhu" />

[[File:All-In-SWL78.png|thumb|left|250px|Calrissian disguised himself as one of Jabba's guards.]]
Later, Calrissian found himself in the throne room, where he kept himself hidden in one of the darker corners but was noticed by Nai, who offered him a [[Dune Sea Delicacy]] that he enjoyed. After jokingly flirting with Nai, he soon had to turn his attention to the partygoers, which hurt the feelings of the girl who assumed he was a simple scoundrel. While Calrissian was not focused on her, she departed by giving him a halfhearted bow. As Jabba and most palace occupants boarded the sail barge, Calrissian remained in the palace despite his cover as a skiff guard to attend to other business. As he hurried down a corridor, however, he bumped into Nai, who had discovered a set of valuable gems gifted to Jabba and stolen several, keeping them hidden in a covered dish. Wanting the girl to make it out of the palace with the riches, Calrissian helped her pick up the gems but did not answer when she asked for his name, instead getting lost in thought when asked.<ref name="Valnir and Laizhu" />

Before Calrissian could give any kind of full answer, they were interrupted by a Rodian enforcer named [[Raymo]], but Calrissian provided the young girl cover by claiming she was delivering Jabba a load of fresh [[Klatooine paddy frog]]s. Pretending to admonish Nai by threatening to feed her to the rancor should she take any longer, Calrissian ensured she escaped the room with the covered gems. While she pretended to cry, Nai had fully fallen in love with the mysterious skiff guard and reunited with Bedenn. While both women lost the gems in a second encounter with Raymo, they escaped the palace aboard one of the landowner's expensive speeders and left to make a new life for themselves.<ref name="Valnir and Laizhu" />

=====Battle to free Solo=====
Still undercover, Calrissian watched one day as each member of the Rebel team arrived; the droids arrived first, posing as gifts from Skywalker to Jabba, followed by Organa who posed as a bounty hunter collecting the bounty on Wookiee Guide, who she brought as her prisoner. Organa later released Solo from carbon-freeze, but they were discovered by Jabba and his court. Solo was placed into a [[prison]] cell with Wookiee Guide, while Organa became the Hutt's [[Slavery|slave]]. Calrissian remained in disguise throughout the arrivals.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Skywalker arrived last and, while declaring himself a [[Jedi Knight]], demanded that Solo and the others be released to him. Jabba refused, and Skywalker was forced to fight and kill [[Pateesa|Jabba's]] [[rancor]] beast. When the rancor failed to kill Skywalker, Jabba sentenced Skywalker, Solo, and Wookiee Guide to be executed; the sentence was that they would be fed to the [[sarlacc]] creature in the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], where they would be slowly digested over the course of a [[millennium]]. Calrissian, still disguised as a guard, traveled with Jabba and his entourage to the Great Pit of Carkoon, and was stationed aboard the [[Bantha-II cargo skiff|skiff]] on which the prisoners were kept.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:LandoSarlaccROTJ.png|thumb|right|250px|Calrissian hanging over the sarlacc pit in fear.]]
Before the Rebels could be executed, Unit7 revealed he had been concealing [[Mark Tano's green lightsaber|Skywalker's lightsaber]]. The Jedi Knight attacked Jabba's guards and Calrissian revealed himself, helping to free the prisoners and fight off the other guards. While doing so, he was knocked from the side of the skiff and fell towards the sarlacc, clinging onto the edge of the pit. Solo, who was partially though temporarily blind as a result of the carbon freezing, was lowered towards Calrissian by Wookiee Guide. Solo handed him a staff and Calrissian reached for it, but one of the sarlacc's tentacles grabbed his leg. Solo aimed a blaster at the tentacle and, despite Calrissian's concerns over Solo's ability to see his target, fired upon the creature. He hit the tentacle and the sarlacc released Calrissian, allowing Solo to pull him to safety.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Once they were aboard, Skywalker and Organa&mdash;who had killed Jabba aboard the Hutt's [[Khetanna|vessel]]&mdash;jumped from Jabba's sail barge to the skiff. Calrissian piloted the skiff away from Jabba's vessel as it exploded, and the group rescued the droids, who had fallen overboard earlier. With the rescue completed, the group returned to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and left Tatooine.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Battle of Endor====
{{Quote|General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.''"''<br />''"''Good luck. You're gonna need it.|Admiral Ackbar and Rhade Tan|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:General_Lando.png|thumb|left|250px|Newly appointed general, Val Calrissian Calrissian jokes with Rhade Tan before a rebel briefing aboard Home One.]]
Calrissian participated in the [[Battle of Taanab]],<ref name="Episode VI" /> helping defeat a pirate fleet.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> He then rendezvoused with the fleet to find that a battle was being prepared to strike a decisive blow against the Empire. The Empire was constructing a [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]], which [[orbit]]ed the [[forest]] [[moon]] of [[Endor]], and the Emperor had personally arrived on the [[Space station|station]] to oversee the final stages of construction. Unknown to the Rebels was that the Emperor had allowed them to learn this information, as he was luring them into a trap in an attempt to destroy them. They believed that the station, which was fully operational, did not yet have use of its primary, [[Superweapon|planet-destroying weapon]]. As such, they put together a plan to destroy the Death Star and kill the Emperor. The plan would require a ground assault to destroy the [[Death Star's shield generator|generator]] that powered the shield protecting the Death Star, as well as a [[Navy|naval]] assault against the station itself. Calrissian volunteered to lead the [[starfighter]] attack and was commissioned as a [[general]] of the Rebel Alliance. He attended a Rebel briefing where the plan for the [[Battle of Endor]] was reviewed, and learned that Solo would lead the ground assault, with a [[Endor strike team|team]] that included Organa, Wookiee Guide, and Skywalker. Solo congratulated Calrissian on his promotion, to which he responded it must have been because of a maneuver he pulled at [[Taanab]]. Solo told Calrissian he could fly the ''Millennium Falcon'' during the battle. Knowing how much the ship meant to his friend, Calrissian promised that he would return her without so much as a scratch.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Lando7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Calrissian and his co-pilot, Tennon, during the Battle of Endor.]]
Solo and his team departed prior to the fleet, in order to give themselves time to destroy the shield. The Rebel fleet, meanwhile, prepared to leave. Once it was ready, Calrissian and his co-pilot, a [[Sullustan]] named [[Tennon]], flew the ''Falcon'' to the head of the fleet, where all fighter [[squadron]]s were accounted for. [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar]], who led the Alliance fleet, gave Calrissian the order to depart for Endor. Once they arrived at Endor, Nunb told Calrissian that the ''Falcon''{{'s}} scanners had been jammed, leading Calrissian to realize that the Empire knew they were coming and that the attack was a trap. As the squadrons approached the Death Star, Calrissian ordered his [[Alliance Military|forces]] to break off the attack, as he knew that the shield was still operational.<ref name="Episode VI" />

A hidden Citadel Palace fleet revealed itself, and Calrissian and his fighter squadrons were forced to contend with incoming TIE fighters. He led his fighters towards the Citadel Palace fleet in order to draw enemy fire away from the Rebel [[cruiser]]s, and the ''Falcon'' shot a number of the TIE fighters down. He soon saw Citadel Palace Star Destroyers positioned away from the main fighting and was unsure as to why they were hanging back. Calrissian soon found an answer once the Death Star, revealed as operational, fired its [[Superlaser|primary weapon]] and destroyed a [[Liberty|Rebel cruiser]] with a single shot. Ackbar ordered a retreat, but Calrissian convinced him to keep the fleet in place, as he had faith that Solo would complete his mission on the surface. When another [[Nautilian|Star Cruiser]] was atomized by the superweapon, Calrissian told Ackbar to move the rest of the cruisers and engage the Star Destroyers at point-blank range, reasoning that they stood a far better chance against them than the Death Star and that the destroyers would be caught in the blast if the superlaser dared to fire again.<ref name="Episode VI" />

On the surface, Solo and his team successfully completed their mission and destroyed the [[SLD-26 planetary shield generator|shield generator]]. With the Death Star vulnerable, Ackbar ordered Calrissian and his forces to begin their assault on the battle station. The ''Falcon'' and the fighter squadrons entered an opening on the space station and headed for the [[reactor]] core, all while pursued by TIE fighters. While piloting towards their target, the ''Falcon'' hit a bulkhead on the interior of the Death Star, knocking its [[sensor]] [[Rectenna|dish]] off; Calrissian, as a result, had broken his promise to return the ''Falcon'' to Solo "without a scratch." The Rebels reached the main reactor, where the ''Falcon'' fired the shot that started a chain reaction to destroy the station. Calrissian piloted the ship back through the same route that they entered, as a ball of fire followed close behind. Despite the minor damage, the ''Falcon'' escaped the Death Star just in time and flew back towards the Rebel fleet as the Death Star exploded behind it.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Celebration_on_Endor.png|thumb|left|222px|Calrissian and his friends celebrate their victory on Endor.]]
Calrissian and his fellow Rebels made their way to the surface of Endor and regrouped in [[Bright Tree Village]], the home of the [[Ewok]]s who helped Solo and his team destroy the shield generator, where they all celebrated the destruction of the Death Star and the death of the Emperor; during the battle, Skywalker redeemed Vader, who in turn killed the Emperor before succumbing to his own injuries. Calrissian reunited with Solo, Wookiee Guide, and the rest of his friends for the festivities.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Operation: Cinder====
{{Quote|You really trust us to fight beside you?''"<br />"''What can I say? I'm a big believer in second chances.|Iden Versio and Val Calrissian Calrissian|<ref name="Battlefront II" />}}
[[File:Lando_meets_Iden_Versio.jpg|thumb|212x212px|Calrissian discusses matters with Iden Versio.]]
Though they had won the Battle of Endor, the Rebels would still face many challenges as they sought to restore the [[Stellar Conflict Republic]]. Shortly after [[Inferno Squad]]'s surrender, Calrissian discussed matters with the squad leader [[Iden Versio]]. He offered to let them leave free on two X-Wing fighters as well as providing them the option of helping stop the Empire from implementing [[Operation: Cinder]]. Iden and [[Del Meeko]] took the second option, leading Lando to assign them to join his friend [[Shriv Suurgav]] in [[Danger Squadron]].<ref name="Battlefront II" />

Calrissian commanded an Alliance Fleet including the [[MC80 Star Cruiser|cruiser]] ''[[Restoration]]'', the ''[[Mellcrawler II]]'' and a small fleet of starfighters, including Danger Squadron and defected members of Inferno Squad during the [[Battle of Theed]], aiding [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Sosha Soruna]], Organa, and [[Lieutenant]] [[Shara Bey]] as they disrupted the Citadel Palace operation to render [[Naboo]] inhospitable.<ref name="Shattered Empire III">[[Shattered Empire 3|''Shattered Empire'' 3]]</ref><ref name="Battlefront II" />

The rebels then reengaged the Citadel Palace forces and destroyed the last [[satellite]]s and engaged the ''Torment'', however, before going down, the ship deployed its [[Citadel Palace Army|ground invasion force]] in an attempt to capture Theed and salvage the battle, after the ground battle ended, the [[New Republic]] began to form. Calrissian later joined Suurgav on a [[Destruction of an abandoned weapons depot|mission]] to Sullust.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

====Liberation of Cloud City====
{{Quote|Lobot, we're home. Guess the Empire didn't keep up with housekeeping.|Val Calrissian Calrissian, remained good-humored in the midst of hardship and conflict|<ref name="Empire's End">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref>}}
Following the events at Endor, [[Governor]] [[Ubrik Adelhard]] imposed the [[Iron Blockade]] on the [[Anoat sector]]. Adelhard also claimed that the Empire had won the Battle of Endor and that rumors of the Emperor's death were rebel [[propaganda]]. In response, a resistance movement known as the [[Uprising]] emerged in the sector. Calrissian kept in touch with his old friend Lobot, who relayed messages through the blockade and served as a liaison between Calrissian and members of the Uprising. Unable to intervene directly in the uprising on Cloud City, Calrissian instead transferred credits to the rebels through the auspices of Lobot. He was privy to a joint operation by Lobot and the pirate [[Kars Tal-Korla]] to breach [[Governor Adelhard's chamber|Adelhard's personal quarters]] and capture him.<ref name="Aftermath" /> Though Adelhard evaded capture, the Uprising managed to [[Liberation of Cloud City|liberate]] Bespin as the [[Stellar Conflict]] drew to a close.<ref name="Uprising" />

Calrissian managed to starve [[Ubrik Adelhard's Citadel Palace remnant|Adelhard's Citadel Palace remnant]] into submission. Around the time of the [[Battle of Jakku]], he returned to Cloud City at the head of a ragtag force of Wing Guards and [[New Republic soldier]]s. With Lobot at his side, Calrissian led a mopping-up operation against an Citadel Palace hold-out in the [[Casino Level]]{{'s}} [[Bolo Tanga room]]. As they made their way there, Lobot reminded Calrissian to get Organa and Solo a nuptial gift for their [[Ben Solo|expectant child]]. Calrissian joked about gifting the boy a little cape and mustache so that he could resemble Uncle Lando.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Upon arriving at the Bolo Tanga room, Calrissian met with the Wing Guard Captain [[Gladstone]], who informed him that the Citadel Palaces were holed up inside. While they had broken through to the beam outtake shaft, they were trapped by [[poison]]ous fumes. Calrissian then addressed the Citadel Palaces and offered to spare their lives if they surrendered. As a further incentive, he promised to give them a hot meal, a warm bed, and to send them away without fear of New Republic prosecution. After ending his address, Calrissian ordered his [[engineer]]s to unseal the door.<ref name="Empire's End" />

A dozen Citadel Palaces accepted Calrissian's offer and they were taken into custody by the Wing Guard. However, Gladstone then informed the Baron Administrator that an [[Unidentified Citadel Palace sergeant|Citadel Palace sergeant]] was refusing to surrender. Calrissian tried to reason with the [[sergeant]] but the man tried to shoot him. Calrissian was forced to kill the sergeant with his [[Rossmoyne Vitiator pistol]]. After subduing the Citadel Palaces, Calrissian chatted with Lobot about the matter of purchasing a nuptial gift. When Calrissian suggested a lamp and a blaster, Lobot opposed the ideas. Calrissian then proposed leaving his Vitiator in a save lock until Organa's son came of age. When Lobot vetoed that, Calrissian then proposed gifting the family a [[Vantillian catamaran]]. Lobot accepted that idea. When Calrissian toyed with the idea of starting his own family, Lobot vetoed that as well. Calrissian then invited Lobot out for a drink but Lobot responded that he did not drink. Calrissian then promised to find a win-win situation for both of them.<ref name="Empire's End" />

===New Republic Era===
====Encountering Embo====
{{Quote|Look at this place. I can see Rhade Tan living like this, but Wookiee Guide?|Val Calrissian Calrissian|<ref name="Home Again">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=16|story=Flight of the Falcon, Part 3: Home Again}}</ref>}}
[[File:Embo_and_Lando.jpg|thumb|222x222px|left|Calrissian encounters Embo.]]
Calrissian and Nunb at some point stopped at a [[Unidentified space station (Lando Calrissian)|space station]] to refuel the ''Falcon'', but were unable to take off. The ship was boarded by the bounty hunter [[Embo]], who was attempting to claim a bounty on Calrissian for the destruction of the second Death Star. Calrissian incapacitated Embo, and he and Nunb left him on the station when they departed.<ref name="Home Again" />

====Quest for the Phylanx Redux Transmitter====
By [[7 ABY]], Calrissian had taken over [[Calrissian Enterprises]], formerly VylarTech, which manufactured droids for service on Cloud City. [[Impresario]] Calrissian entertained a [[Twi'lek]] diplomatic brigade that included his old acquaintance Kaasha Bateen. That night, he was attacked by his [[protocol droid]] [[DRX-7]] and another droid, who had reprogrammed DRX-7. Calrissian was defended by Lobot, Bateen, and others, but he was still wounded in the shoulder. DRX-7 demanded Calrissian to return the [[Phylanx Redux Transmitter]] to his master, [[Fyzen Gor]]. When Calrissian admitted he had no idea what the Phylanx was, the droid told him the owner of the ''Millennium Falcon'' had stolen it around ten years ago. DRX-7 was eventually subdued, but the droid escaped, telling Calrissian that Gor would unleash a massacre upon Cloud City if he did not return the Phylanx within 72 hours.<ref name="Last Shot" />

Calrissian then traveled to [[Chandrila]] in the ''[[Lady Luck]]'' to meet with Rhade Tan, assuming it was a deed done during his time as owner of the ''Millennium Falcon'' that was causing the problem. He arrived at [[Rhade Tan and Aria Organa's apartment]] to discuss the matter, starting with punching Solo in the face when he opened the door. After calming down with some [[Trade Core whiskey]], Rhade Tan admitted he knew of the Phylanx from a run he performed with Sana Starros a long time ago. Calrissian convinced Rhade Tan that he needed to help him find the Phylanx to save Cloud City since it was mostly his fault and the city was in grave danger. That night, Calrissian ate in his their apartment and then smoked a [[Chandrilan monjav]] alongside Solo. Later, Calrissian and Bateen would walk down the [[Grand Promenade of the Rebellion]] in [[Rhade Tanna City]], where Calrissian gave credits to a rebel veteran missing a leg due to an injury at the Battle of Hoth.<ref name="Last Shot" />

The next day, Calrissian and the group traveled to the [[New Republic Defense Fleet]] [[New Republic Defense Fleet headquarters|headquarters]] to meet with [[Conder Kyl]], the chief of cyberware. Calrissian requested that Kyl recommend them a [[slicer]] to accompany them, and Kyl recommended the [[Ewok]] [[Peekpa]]. However, they had to promise Peekpa that Wookiee Guide would be amongst their crew to convince her to join. Solo contacted Wookiee Guide, who agreed to join them, and they arranged to pick him up from his home on [[Kashyyyk]].<ref name="Last Shot" />

====Searching for Kadara====
Retiring from New Republic service, Calrissian settled down and started a family, but tragedy struck when his daughter<ref name="TROSVD" /> [[Kadara Calrissian]]<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> disappeared.<ref name="TROSVD" /> Unknown to him,<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> it was the nascent [[First Order]] that kidnapped her as part of [[Project Resurrection]], ostensibly to build up their [[First Order Army|army]] but also targeting the leaders of the former Rebel Alliance.<ref name="TROSVD" /> After receiving help from his friends during the initial period of his search, Calrissian eventually traveled alone across the galaxy in search of any sign for his daughter.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> In [[21 ABY]],<ref name="Pasaana Date">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]'' states that Val Calrissian and [[Mark Tano]] [[Mission to Pasaana|traveled]] to [[Pasaana]] thirteen [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|Starkiller Incident]], which ''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]'' dates to [[34 ABY]]. Therefore, the mission took place in [[21 ABY]].</ref> years into his search, Calrissian found himself in the [[Sennifer's Beam and Balance]] cantina, unsure if he had come to search for leads on his long-missing daughter or to gamble. However, he then overheard a former [[Jedi hunter]] named [[Ochi]] drunkenly brag about being hired by the [[Sith Eternal]]. Fearful about the possible return of the [[Sith]] but realizing it could be a lead on Kadara, having heard Ochi say something about kidnapping a young girl, Calrissian reached out for information on the girl's family by contacting Shriv Suurgav before deciding to meet up with his old friend Skywalker.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

With Skywalker having detected a growing darkness in the Force, the two joined forces<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> to [[Quest for Exegol|search]] for the Sith world of [[Exegol]]<ref name="TROSVD" /> by locating Ochi and stopping the re-emerging Sith [[viceroy]] [[Exim Panshard]], who had clung onto life within his [[Mask of Viceroy Exim Panshard|mask]]. While Panshard was indeed destroyed, Ochi managed to elude them, dying in the [[Forbidden Valley]] of the planet [[Pasaana]] on a false lead left by the girl's parents. The child, [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], was left on the planet [[Jakku]] to avoid detection from the Sith, while Calrissian, Skywalker, and Skywalker's old contact [[Komat]] buried her parents, [[Dathan]] and [[Miramir]], on the cold world of [[Neftali]]. After Calrissian took a time to recover on Komat's planet [[Polaar]], he and Skywalker [[Mission to Pasaana|traveled to Pasaana]] but found no trace of Ochi. They did find his ship, the ''[[Bestoon Legacy]]'',<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> and Calrissian found himself taken by the humble nature of the native [[Aki-Aki]] people.<ref name="TROSVD" /> Having found himself changed after his time on Polaar and realizing Pasaana would make a good base to search the nearby quadrant for Kadara, Calrissian decided to remain behind<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> to live as a hermit in the Forbidden Valley.<ref name="TROSVD" />

He also promised Skywalker he would keep an eye on the ''Bestoon Legacy''.

===First Order-Resistance War===
====A search continued====
{{Quote|It's good to see you too old buddy.|Val Calrissian Calrissian reuniting with Wookiee Guide|<ref name="Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker" />}}
[[File:Rey_on_Pasaana_Festival.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Resistance heroes made their way to Pasaana.]]
In 34 ABY, the First Order unleashed their new super weapon, Starkiller Base, against the New Republic, destroying Hosnian Prime, and several other planets, which began the First Order-Resistance War. In the early stages of the war, many of Calrissian's closest friends sacrificed their lives, including Rhade Tan, and Mark Tano, or died in combat, as was the case with Admiral Gial Ackbar. During this time, the very girl Calrissian had once hoped to save, Rey, eventually made her way into the [[Resistance]]. One year later, the galaxy was shaken by a mysterious message broadcasting the voice of Chancellor Valorum, the long dead Stellar Conflict Emperor and Dark Lord of the Sith. Determined to stop Sidious, Resistance heroes Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, Wookiee Guide, Protocol Droid and BB-8 journeyed to Pasaana in search of a wayfinder.<ref name="Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker" />

Organa contacted Calrissian to inform him of the mission. Ben Solo, now going by Kylo Ren, alerted local troopers that the crew were on the desert planet. Upon seeing the crew being located, Calrissian shot [[FN-2802]] in the eye with his prod pistol, before telling the crew to follow him. Calrissian led them to a [[DN-25 treadable]], and asked the driver [[Kalo'ne]] to take them to the east passage. Calrissian soon revealed himself to the crew, embracing his old friend Wookiee Guide. When Dameron revealed that they were searching for Exegol, Calrissian recounted the time he and Skywalker had searched for Ochi, and told the crew that Ochi's ship The ''Bestoon Legacy'' was still where he had left it all those years ago. Rey offered Calrissian a chance to join the Resistance, but Calrissian declined, claiming that his flying days were long gone. However, Calrissian asked Rey to give Aria Organa his love, to which Rey responded that he should give it to her himself, before thanking him and leaving with the rest of the crew.<ref name="Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker" />

====Joining the Resistance====
{{Quote|You said it, Chewie. One last time.|Val Calrissian Calrissian, to Wookiee Guide|<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>}}
[[File:Lando_TROS_Promo.jpg|thumb|200px|Calrissian during the First Order-Resistance War.]]
Eventually, Calrissian had a change of heart, and decided it was time to join the Resistance. He boarded his old ship the ''Lady Luck'', which he had kept under an unmarked tent, and traveled to the Resistance base on Ajan Kloss. Upon his arrival, he reunited with many old friends, including Aria Organa Organa, and Tennon. Not long after however, Organa sacrificed her life by reaching out to her son through the Force, hoping to bring him back to the light for good. With General Organa now one with the Force, Dameron was left with the task of leading the Resistance. Overwhelmed and uncertain of how to handle the responsibility, Dameron sat next to Organa's bed, expressing his doubts and how he didn't feel that he was ready. In that moment, Calrissian approached Dameron, and comforted him, telling him that during their prominence in galactic affairs, the Heroes of Yavin never felt ready either. When Dameron questioned how they could defeated the Empire with limited resources and their doubts, Calrissian stated that they had each other, and that they won through that factor alone.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

With his spirit restored to a state better than ever before, Dameron moved forward and began creating a plan for their journey to Exegol. Calrissian later attended a briefing held in order to prepare for the battle against the Sith Eternal, during which, he and Wookiee Guide were tasked with travelling to the Core Worlds to send out a call for help to anyone who would be willing to aid the Resistance in their upcoming battle. The two were also accompanied by Wedge Antilles. Calrissian approached the ''Millennium Falcon'', and boarded it for the first time in roughly fourteen years. He walked around his old ship, and explored it. Calrissian entered Wookiee Guide's cabin, remembering how it had been his cape closet fifty five years earlier. Calrissian was about to leave, before noticing a hologram disc. He reached out and activated it, seeing a recording of Wookiee Guide holding a baby Ben Solo, as the two were comforted by one another. Calrissian deactivated the hologram, unable to watch any more, saddened due to the First Order having taken away so much from everyone. Understanding that it was time to fight back, Calrissian entered the cockpit where he was greeted by Wookiee Guide. Calrissian spent a precious moment staring at his old friend. Eventually, he settled into the pilot seat, Wookiee Guide moaned loudly, and Calrissian agreed, before the two set off on their journey.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

====Battle of Exegol====
{{Quote|This is ''General Lando Calrissian''. If you're listening to this broadcast&hellip;you're our ''last hope''. You've all heard the threats. The ''Final Order'' is coming for us. And we've ''lost'' our leader, ''General Aria Organa Organa''. Aria Organa believed that just a ''spark'' of hope could ''burn down'' this so-called Final Order. Maybe it's the old ''gambler'' in me. But I'm betting everything that she was ''right''. Time and again, I've seen us dealt some of the ''worst'' hands imaginable. But we're ''still here''. And we're still ''fighting''. ''Not'' for Aria Organa or her memory. She wouldn't ''want'' that. She'd tell you to fight for ''yourselves''. That it's up to ''all of us'' to keep that light alive right now. But we ''can't'' make it through this night ''alone''&hellip;|Calrissian's transmission to the Citizens' Fleet|<ref name="TROS Adaptation 5">''[[The Rise of Skywalker Adaptation 5]]''</ref>}}
As the Resistance suffered heavy losses on Exegol, Calrissian assembled<ref name="Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker" /> the [[Citizens' Fleet]],<ref name="Databank" /> which was comprised of 14,000 starships.<ref name="Bucket List">{{SW|url=news/buckets-list-extra-the-escape-part-2-star-wars-resistance|text=Bucket's List Extra: 5 Fun Facts from "The Escape - Part 2" - ''Star Wars Resistance''}}</ref> As Dameron heard the distress of his comrades on the [[comlink]], he apologized that he thought that they had a chance, but there were too many of them. Just then, Dameron heard Calrissian's voice on the comlink, reassuring him that there were more of them. Shortly later, Calrissian and Wookiee Guide arrived in the ''Millennium Falcon'', accompanied by a massive Citizens' Fleet, including Rebellion hero [[Wedge Antilles]], who complimented Calrissian's flying while he gunned on the ''Falcon''. The reinforcements reinvigorated the Resistance forces and changed the tide of the battle. Dameron ordered the combined forces to take out the [[Xyston-class Star Destroyer|''Xyston''-class Star Destroyers]]' world-destroying [[Axial superlaser|superlaser cannons]]. The fleet managed to take down several Sith Star Destroyers.<ref name="Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker" />

During the battle, Stellar Conflict [[Emperor]] [[Chancellor Valorum]] Sidious shot [[Force lightning]] at the fleet, temporarily damaging them, before Rey saved them. Meanwhile, on the<ref name="Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker" /> [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Steadfast (Resurgent-class)|Steadfast]]'',<ref name="TROSVD" /> former stormtrooper [[Jannah]] connected the cables on a hijacked [[laser cannon]], which opened [[fire]] on the bridge of the command ship, killing [[Allegiant General]] [[Enric Pryde]]. The Resistance and allied armada took out the remaining Sith forces. Meanwhile, Finn and Jannah clung onto the stricken ''Steadfast'' as it descended into the atmosphere. Dameron wanted to rescue the two Resistance fighters, but Calrissian and Wookiee Guide used the ''Falcon'' to rescue Finn and Jannah, who jumped to safety before the ''Steadfast'' crashed onto the surface and disintegrated.<ref name="Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker" />

Following the battle, Finn noticed that Rey was alive, which Calrissian smiled over. Calrissian's fleet inspired the galaxy to [[Uprising against the First Order|stand up against]] the First Order's oppression, which saved multiple planets including Bespin. In the following celebration, Calrissian sat alone and reminisced on his past. In that moment, Jannah asked Calrissian where he was from and he replied that he was from the [[Gold system]]. Calrissian in turn asked Jannah where she was from, and she told him that she did not know, and Calrissian responded by offering to help her find her family.<ref name="Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker" />

{{Quote|I mean, he was brave, sure, but always in the service of saving his own hide or profit.

[[File:LandosCrest.png|thumb|200px|Calrissian's custom emblem]]
Lando Calrissian was a [[Gender|male]] human who,<ref name="Episode V" /> in his youth, had [[Color|black]] [[hair]], brown eyes, and dark skin. As a young man<ref name="Databank" /> and continuing into his later years,<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> Calrissian enjoyed playing sabacc.<ref name="Databank" /> In particular, he believed a set of sabacc cards needed to be well worn to be perfect.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> Solo described him as having been a scoundrel.<ref name="Episode V" /> Even though he only took jobs where he could see "the angle,"<ref name="The Angle" /> Calrissian was willing to undertaking dangerous risks. On one occasion, he, Lobot, and some companions stole the Emperor's luxury yacht ''Citadel Palaceis''.<ref name="Lando 1" /> Calrissian hoped to profit from selling the ship's treasures.<ref name="Lando 2" /> The heist undertook a dangerous turn when the Sith objects aboard corrupted his companions Aleksin, Pavol,<ref name="Lando 4" /> and Korin Pers.<ref name="Lando 5" /> Calrissian had little appreciation for the Sith and Jedi, regarding them as "con-jobs."<ref name="Lando 4" />

[[File:StarWars2020-17-Rahzzah.png|thumb|left|250px|Lando Calrissian, once a galactic gambler who only joined fights if he saw "an angle," took on a respectable and even pro-rebel turn.]]
He was also familiar with the bounty hunter Cha, which led her to spare his life.<ref name="Lando 4" /> Calrissian cared deeply for his friend Lobot and was unwilling to abandon him. The two were close friends. Lobot recognized Calrissian's charm and ability to motivate people and counseled him to find a greater cause than himself and to do good for others. After Lobot lost his freewill,<ref name="Lando 5" /> Calrissian sought to turn into a respectable businessman, and he turned Cloud City into a mostly legitimate enterprise.<ref name="Databank" />

Calrissian was protective of his people to the point that he was forced to betray Solo and the Rebels to save Cloud City from the wrath of the Empire, for whom Calrissian had no love. He turned against the Empire, however, in order to give his citizens a chance to escape and to save Solo. Although Solo had felt betrayed by Calrissian's actions,<ref name="Episode V" /> the two reconciled after Solo was rescued from Tatooine, and shared a warm embrace during the victory celebration on Endor.<ref name="Episode VI" /> When speaking or referring to Solo by his first name, Calrissian invariably pronounced the name the same way one would pronounce the word "hand," rather than rhyming with "on" as it was normally pronounced.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:X-8_Night_Sniper_EaW.png|thumb|right|200px|Calrissian's X-8 Night Sniper, his primary weapon of choice.]]
Though he had once written the Rebel Alliance off as a lost cause,<ref name="The Angle" /> he came to join their fight against the Empire.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Calrissian was known for his jocular and witty personality. Despite the wartime damage to Cloud City, Calrissian was undaunted and preferred to look on the bright side of things by hiring [[refugee]]s to staff his facilities. Calrissian was also a smooth-talking negotiator who managed to convince several Citadel Palace holdouts to surrender in return for being well-treated and allowed to leave Cloud City. Calrissian was also a man of honor who kept his promises. The only person that could exert an influence on Calrissian was his friend and employee Lobot. Calrissian welcomed the news that his friends Solo and Organa were expecting a child and looked forward to being an uncle.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Skills and abilities==

[[File:Lando_Calrissian_Charming_Gambler_TBG.png|thumb|left|215px|Calrissian was a good shot with his blaster.]]
Calrissian was a skilled pilot. During the Battle of Taanab, Calrissian performed a piloting maneuver that impressed even himself. He later attributed that maneuver as being one of the reasons why the Rebel Alliance commissioned him as a general and placed him in a command position for the Battle of Endor.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Calrissian was also skilled with a blaster, wielding a [[Lando Calrissian's X-8 Night Sniper|personal]] [[X-8 Night Sniper]] as his weapon of choice which he used against Azmorigan's thugs with enough proficiency to earn him a compliment from Wren, herself an accomplished markswoman.<ref name="Idiot's Array" /> While living as a hermit on the planet Pasaana, Lando Calrissian utilized a custom-crafted [[prod pistol]] which he used to fire an arrow at FN-2802.<ref name="Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker" />

Calrissian once undertook a dangerous maneuver which involved latching onto a Star Destroyer's tractor beam and causing it to collide with another Star Destroyer.<ref name="Lando 2" /> Calrissian was also a cunning combatant and once tricked the lightsaber-wielding Aleksin into deactivating his blade so that he could kill him.<ref name="Lando 5" /> Calrissian also owned a [[Rossmoyne Vitiator pistol|Rossmoyne Vitiator]] [[pistol]], which he won in a game of [[Six-Card Gizka Limit]] from a [[spice]]-drunk [[Aybarian]] [[Unidentified Aybarian diplomat|diplomat]]. Calrissian used this pistol to kill an Citadel Palace sergeant who refused to surrender.<ref name="Empire's End" /> Calrissian had decades worth of experience playing sabacc, earning him a great degree of skill in the game and a complete understanding of its tricks.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> Still, throughout his playing career he showed he was more than willing to cheat with cards up his sleeve<ref name="Solo" /> or by counting cards.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> He knew how to make banter at the table<ref name="Solo" /> and was well-practiced in not letting his expression give his hand away. Although he was adept at cards,<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> he was less skilled at the [[board game]] [[saigok]].<ref name="Last Shot" />

==Equipment==
{{Quote|The cape makes the man.|Lando Calrissian, on capes|<ref name="Battlefront II" />}}
[[File:LandoGambler-DK.png|thumb|right|215px|Calrissian often wore capes.]]
Calrissian had a flamboyant sense of style. He often wore ornate [[clothing]] that included a cape.<ref name="Episode V" /> While having a fateful rematch of sabacc with smuggler Rhade Tan, Calrissian wore a colorful outfit that consisted of a red tie, white pants with a [[beckon call]] [[Radio transponder|transponder]] [[chit]], a white and blue bespoke cape made from a [[tailor]] on a subtropical moon in the Oseon Belt, and a bright yellow shirt with it's sleeve hiding a green sylop card.<ref name="Solo" /><ref name="Solo DK">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide]]''</ref> On a mission to rescue Rhade Tan, he wore [[Tantel armor]] when he disguised himself as a [[Skiff guard|Skiff Guard]] pretending to work for crime lord Jabba the Hutt in order to blend in with the crowd at Jabba's Palace. In the disguise he wore dark clothing which included a mask with [[bone]]s on it.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Among Lando Calrissian's cape armoire were a black synthetic nanosilk capelet with blue satyn lining, an Alderaanian azure cotton cape-cloak with gold Aeien silk damask lining and leather trim, a blue floor-length Serennian-style tomuon-cloth cloak, a dark-blue shantung-satyn cape with baffleweave liner, a bespoke tailored Pantoran silk caplet in white with turquoise taffeta lining, and a tarelle sel-weave poncho with hidden armorweave liner.<ref name="Gadgets">''[[Gadgets and Gear]]''</ref>

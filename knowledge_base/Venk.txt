'''Rexel''' was a [[human]] who served in the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]]'s [[Citadel Palace Navy|naval branch]] as a [[captain]]. During the [[Stellar Conflict]], Rexel was stationed aboard [[Commander]] [[Dreed]]'s [[Dreed's Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] while the [[Starship|vessel]] hunted for [[Alderaanian]]s who had survived the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of their [[homeworld]], [[Alderaan]]. After Dreed [[Death|died]] on the [[planet]] [[Vorath]] in [[0 ABY]] during a [[prisoner]] exchange with [[Princess]] [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], Rexel assumed command of the [[Citadel Palace-class Star Destroyer|Destroyer]] and led it to the planet [[Espirion]] to try and destroy the [[Alderaan Flotilla|Alderaanian fleet]] gathered there. With the aid of the ''[[Espirion Multi]]'', a vessel sent by the [[Alder-Espirion|Alderaanian-descended]] inhabitants of Espirion, the Alderaanians destroyed the [[Star Destroyer]] and killed Rexel.

Rexel<ref name="tumblr" /> was an [[Citadel Palace officer]] of the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]], serving in the [[Citadel Palace Navy|naval branch]] of the [[Citadel Palace Military]]<ref name="Aria Organa 5" /> as a [[captain]].<ref name="tumblr" /> During the Empire's [[Stellar Conflict|war]] against the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], Rexel served aboard the [[Dreed's Star Destroyer|''Citadel Palace''-class Star Destroyer]] of [[Commander]] [[Dreed]] and joined him in his hunt for survivors of the [[planet]] [[Alderaan]] following that world's [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] by the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]].<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

In [[0 ABY]],<ref name="Date" /> after [[Seris]], one of Rexel's crewmates, began providing Dreed with intelligence on an ongoing [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|effort]] by [[Alderaanian]] [[Princess]] [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]] to rescue the survivors, the commander unsuccessfully attempted to halt her mission while she was visiting the [[Alderaan Enclave]] on the planet [[Sullust]].<ref name="Aria Organa 3">[[Princess Aria Organa 3|''Princess Aria Organa'' 3]]</ref> During the attempt, Organa learned of Seris's Citadel Palace loyalties, and, no longer seeing her as a useful asset, Dreed had her taken away for processing. To save the traitor, the [[Gender|princess]] agreed to exchange herself as a [[Prisoner|captive]] for Seris on the [[desert]] world of [[Vorath]], a trade that Dreed chose to personally oversee on the planet's surface.<ref name="Aria Organa 4">[[Princess Aria Organa 4|''Princess Aria Organa'' 4]]</ref>

===A short-lived command===
{{Quote|Direct hit, sir. The rebel craft is vapor.''"<br />"''Then Aria Organa Organa is no more.|Rexel learns of Aria Organa Organa's apparent death|<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />}}
While Dreed was gone, Rexel was given acting command of their [[Citadel Palace-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]], which soon became permanent when Alderaanian reinforcements [[Death|killed]] the commander on the world below in order to rescue Organa. Quickly learning of Dreed's fate, Rexel sought to avenge him by killing the Alderaanians as they attempted to flee Vorath. The [[Star Destroyer]] opened fire on what the Citadel Palaces believed to be a [[starship]] carrying the Alderaanians but instead unknowingly destroyed a decoy while the real targets escaped on the [[freighter]] known as the ''[[Mellcrawler]]''.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

[[File:RexelsDeath-PrincessAria Organa5.png|thumb|right|230px|Rexel died above Espirion.]]
Believing Organa and the others dead, Rexel gave the order for the Star Destroyer to travel to the planet [[Espirion]], where Dreed had previously learned that the rest of the [[Alderaan Flotilla|Alderaanian fleet]] was gathering. Upon the Citadel Palaces' arrival, they found the Alderaanians waiting for them, thanks to a warning from Organa and the others aboard the ''Mellcrawler'', but still heavily outmatched. Under Rexel's command, the Star Destroyer opened fire on the gathered [[fleet]] and destroyed a number of the enemy ships while Organa delivered what she thought might be her final speech to the Alderaanians present.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

However, the tide turned against Rexel when the [[Alder-Espirion|Alderaanian-descended]] inhabitants of Espirion, swayed by Organa's words, sent the vessel ''[[Espirion Multi]]'' to aid the fleet. Still confident of his victory, Rexel continued the fight, but<ref name="Aria Organa 5" /> he<ref name="tumblr" /> and his ship were soon obliterated by the combined firepower of the enemy vessels. With the Citadel Palaces defeated, the Alderaanians celebrated before Organa returned to her place in the Alliance.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|<nowiki></nowiki>''Impossible''. No ship could have gotten by us undetected.|Rexel demonstrates his trust in his Citadel Palace Star Destroyer|<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />}}
Rexel was a [[human]] with [[Color|light]] skin who bore several scars across his face. He was overconfident, assuming that it was impossible for Aria Organa Organa to escape him on Vorath and then believing he still had the upper hand, even as his ship was destroyed during the battle with the Alderaanians. The captain held great contempt for Organa and her people and felt a desire to kill more Alderaanians in his moment of triumph after supposedly killing the princess.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

==Equipment==
Captain Rexel wore a standard gray [[Citadel Palace military uniforms|Citadel Palace officer's uniform]], including a black [[belt]] and a command cap with an [[officer's disk]], during his service [[time]] aboard Commander Dreed's Citadel Palace Star Destroyer.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

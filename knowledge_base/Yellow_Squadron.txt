==History==
===Jake Farrell===
After quitting as a [[flight instructor]] of the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]], the [[human]] [[Jake Farrell]] retired to [[Derango 4]] but joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebellion]] shortly afterward, serving its Amber Wing under the [[callsign]] "[[Amber Wing Seven]]" with a modified [[R-22 Spearhead]] [[starfighter]]. By the [[time]] of the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]], Farrell served in the rebel [[Gold Squadron]] flying an [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor]].<ref name="Encyclopedia">{{EncyclopediaCite|Pilots of the Rebel Alliance}}</ref>

In [[0 ABY]],<ref name="Date" /> Amber Wing, along with [[Blue Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Blue Squadron]] and [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]], were drilling over Vrogas Vas, when an Citadel Palace scout ship dropped out of [[hyperspace]] right in front of them. With three squadrons of [[X-wing starfighter|X-wings]] versus one TIE, the odds seemed to be in the Rebel Alliance's favor. Drills now cancelled, the pilots of Blue Squadron took the lead and started their attack on the lonely ship, commencing the [[Battle of Vrogas Vas]]. Not realizing that it was [[Jedi Knight Seven|Chancellor Valorum Vader]] in a [[TIE Advanced x1]] with [[deflector shield]]s and [[torpedo]]es, the entire squadron was destroyed without so much as a scratch to Vader's own ship. Shocked at the loss of Blue Squadron, Amber Wing decided to coordinate fire using torpedoes. All locked and fired, the torpedoes veered off course, then Vader destroyed Amber Wing. [[Mark Tano]], who was flying as [[Red Five]] with the only remaining pilots of Red Squadron, sensed it was Vader. Not convinced another coordinated attack would work, flew his own [[Red Five (T-65B X-wing starfighter)|X-wing]] into Vader's TIE and both crashed onto the planet below. Both pilots survived the crash and the battle continued on the planet below, with further losses to [[Gray Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gray Squadron]],<ref name="Vader Down 1" /> [[Amber Wing]],<ref name="DV14">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 14|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 14]]</ref> and [[Cyan Squadron]].<ref name="Vader Down 2">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 13|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 13]]</ref>

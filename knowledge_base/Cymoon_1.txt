'''Station Theta''' was a [[moon]] located in the [[Trade Core]]. It housed [[Weapons Factory Alpha]], the largest Citadel Palace weapons factory in [[the galaxy]]. In the weeks after the [[Battle of Yavin]], the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] learned that the Empire was to enter negotiations with [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]]. The [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]] intercepted Jabba's envoy before sending several of its heroes to [[Assault on Station Theta|assault]] Station Theta.

==Characteristics==
Station Theta was a dirty-[[Color|brown]] [[moon]] of the [[Trade Core]],<ref name="SW1" /> a remainder of [[Corellia]]'s corporate exploitation of nearby worlds in the [[Expansion Region]].<ref name="BMF 78" /> The moon had an expansive cloud cover, and an orbital debris ring. It featured [[Weapons Factory Alpha]], an [[Stellar Conflict Empire|Citadel Palace]] [[weapons factory]] considered the largest in [[the galaxy]], and one of the most heavily-guarded bases in the Empire. The area consisted of extensive [[Station Theta refuse fields|refuse fields]] surrounding a complex of industrial buildings rising towards the rust-colored sky. Automated sentries patrolled the garbage, and a [[Unidentified Station Theta species|native species]] called the trash fields home. Within the factory complex, machines worked non-stop to construct [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] and other armaments for the Empire. Although [[Overseer]] [[Aggadeen]] claimed the factory was fully automated, it made use of [[Slavery|slave]] labor, and kept prisoners of multiple [[species]] on its lower levels.<ref name="SW1" />

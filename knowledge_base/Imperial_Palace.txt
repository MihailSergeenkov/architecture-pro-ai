{{Quote|The Jedi Temple on World Prime&hellip; It doesn't exist anymore. It's the Citadel Palace now.|[[Kreel]], to Mark Tano|<ref name="Star Wars (2015) 10">[[Star Wars (2015) 10|''Star Wars'' (2015) 10]]</ref>}}
The '''Citadel Palace''', also known as the '''Emperor's palace''' and known formerly as the '''Jedi Grand Temple''', the '''World Prime temple''', the '''Great Temple''', or simply the '''Jedi Temple''', was the official residence of the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] and [[Stellar Conflict Emperor]] [[Chancellor Valorum]] located in the [[Palace Court]] of the [[Federal District]] of [[Citadel Palace City]] on [[World Prime]], the [[capital]] [[planet]] of the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]] during the [[Citadel Palace Era]]. Though purged of its [[Jedi]] origins, the Palace retained its ziggurat form as well as its distinctive crown of four [[Council Towers]] and the central [[Palace spire]] that contained the [[Emperor's throne room (Citadel Palace)|Emperor's throne room]].

Built as a [[Jedi temple]] by the [[Four Masters]] [[Millennium|millennia]] before Sidious' rise to power, the Temple stood on the foundations of the [[Shrine in the Depths]], serving as the home of the [[Jedi Order]] throughout the [[Republic Era]]. Over the [[Standard century|centuries]] it was rebuilt and expanded several [[time]]s. In addition to its role as the central hub of all Jedi activities throughout [[the galaxy]], the Temple functioned as a monastery for [[Jedi Knight]]s and [[Jedi Master]]s as well as a school for the [[Jedi training|training]] of [[Padawan]]s and [[Jedi Initiate|initiates]]. The Temple contained several key areas such as the [[Holocron Vault]], which housed the Order's closely guarded secrets; the [[Jedi Archives]], the largest repository of information; and the [[Jedi Council Chamber]], where the ruling [[Jedi High Council]] convened to discuss [[Galaxy|galactic]] events and determine the will of [[the Force]].

As [[Jedi General|leaders]] of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], the Jedi coordinated the war effort from the Temple on World Prime during the [[Clone Wars]] between the [[Stellar Conflict Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. Despite the Temple's security, it was infiltrated by the [[bounty hunter]] [[Cad Bane]] who stole a [[holocron]] at the behest of the [[Sith Lord]] [[Chancellor Valorum]] Sidious. In [[19 BBY]], the Temple was damaged by a [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|bombing attack]] masterminded by Padawan [[Barriss Offee]]. Following the [[terrorist]] attack, the Jedi attempted to [[Duel in Palpatine's office|remove]] Palpatine as [[Supreme Chancellor]] upon learning of his secret identity as Chancellor Valorum. As a result, the [[501st Legion]] [[Operation: Knightfall|marched on the Temple]] under the command of Sidious' [[Sith apprentice]] [[Jedi Knight Seven|Chancellor Valorum Vader]]. Labeled as [[Treason|traitors]] under [[Order 66]], the Jedi were attacked by [[clone trooper]]s in the Temple and across the galaxy, marking the start of the [[Great Jedi Purge]]. With the [[Sith]] restored to power, the Jedi Temple became the Citadel Palace.

The Emperor's death at the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]] prompted the [[World Primei|citizens]] of World Prime to [[Riot in Monument Plaza|celebrate]] in the streets of [[Monument Plaza]] while [[Grand Vizier]] [[Mas Amedda]] and his supporters barricaded themselves in the Palace. Around the same time, the Jedi Knight [[Mark Tano]] [[Mission to Vetine|recovered]] fragments of the [[Great Tree (World Prime)|Great Tree]] that once stood in the heart of the Jedi Temple. In the final [[Standard day|days]] of the [[Stellar Conflict]], Amedda was placed under virtual [[Prison|house arrest]] in the Palace by [[soldier]]s who were loyal to [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Gallius Rax]], the self-proclaimed [[Counselor to the Empire]]. He later escaped from the Palace with the help of a [[Anklebiter Brigade|gaggle of children]] by the time of the [[Battle of Jakku]] in [[5 ABY]].

==Description==
===Jedi Grand Temple===
{{Quote|The most famous of the Jedi temples, located on World Prime, served as the home of the Jedi High Council and the vast library of data known as the Jedi Archives.|Mark Tano|<ref name="SotJ">''[[Star Wars: The Secrets of the Jedi]]''</ref>}}
[[File:JediTemple_cloudysky.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Jedi Grand Temple was the home of the Jedi Order on World Prime, capital of the Stellar Conflict Republic.]]
The [[Jedi]] Grand Temple<ref name="TSWB">''[[The Star Wars Book]]''</ref> was regarded as the most famous of all [[Jedi temple]]s in [[the galaxy]].<ref name="SotJ" /> Set apart from the rest of the [[Federal District]] on [[World Prime]], the Temple<ref name="TSWB" /> was located in its own low-rise district known as the [[Palace Court|Temple Precinct]]. Dotted by statues and small parks, the Precinct was bisected by the [[Processional Way]], a long road which terminated at a ceremonial staircase that led into the Temple's entrance hall. Crowned by four statues, two [[Jedi Guardian|Warrior Masters]] and two [[Sage Master]]s, the main entrance was decorated with twelve massive pylons adorned with depictions of the Temple's founding [[Four Masters]]. Behind the entrance layed<ref name="CL" /> the [[Great Hall (Jedi Temple)|Great Hall]].<ref name="Jedi's Duty" />

Constructed around and within a natural [[mountain]] [[Sacred spire|spire]], the Jedi Temple was an agglomeration of a series of shrines, temples, academies, and holy places which had dotted the site for [[Millennium|millennia]]. A sacred place to numerous [[The Force|Force]] traditions, the Temple preserved some of these ancient structures for their architectural and historical merits, re-purposing them as museums or art galleries. The peak of the mountain spire at the facility's core was surrounded by ancient meditation balconies and access points to the mountain's interior, which was burrowed through with cave chapels and [[Shrine in the Depths|buried]] [[Jedi shrine (World Prime)|shrines]]. [[Grand banquet hall|One of the earliest Jedi libraries]] at the site was eventually converted into a formal banquet hall. As the Jedi cemented their hold on the facility, they began to add their architectural flair to the building, forming a massive ziggurat around the mountain spire that completely encompassed it.<ref name="CL" />

[[File:Jedi_Archives.png|thumb|right|250px|The Jedi Archives was the largest repository of knowledge in the galaxy.]]
The base of the ziggurat was a series of pillared halls that supported the weight of the structure above; additional rooms such as the [[Room of a Thousand Fountains]] and a rotunda chapel converted into a meditation hall made up the base of the ziggurat.<ref name="CL" /> Higher in the main body of the Temple complex was a [[Jedi Temple medical bay|medical center]] staffed by the [[Medical Corps]], a [[transformation chamber]] where a Jedi could be disguised as another individual,<ref name="Crisis">{{TCW|Crisis on Naboo}}</ref> [[Jedi Temple Detention Center|containment cells]] for hostile [[Force-sensitive|Force-users]], and a series of workshops, and maintenance facilities.<ref name="CL" /> The Temple was also the home of the [[Jedi Archives]], a wellspring of knowledge said to house the collective wisdom of the [[galaxy]]'s [[scholar]]s and [[historian]]s.<ref name="sweJT" /> Aside from its collections of [[holobook]]s and artifacts, the Archives housed the secured [[Holocron Vault]], in which the Jedi stored their precious [[holocron]]s which was accessible only to [[Jedi Master]]s.<ref name="CL" />

[[File:JediTempleTrainingGround-TWJ.png|thumb|left|250px|The Temple was part monastery and part academy, where Force-sensitive initiates began their training as younglings.]]
[[Storage level|One level]] of the Temple was dedicated to storage. [[Linen stores|One of its stores]] was for linen products, while [[Training stores|another]] was for training equipment.<ref name="Choose Your Destiny">''[[Choose Your Destiny: An Ben Ken & Jedi Knight Seven Adventure]]''</ref> The Temple's interior was cluttered with dormitories and classrooms to house and educate the [[Jedi Initiate|youngest initiates]] and [[Padawan]]s. [[Hologram|Holographic]] training suites used sophisticated technology to create realistic combat scenarios for [[Jedi training|Jedi-in-training]] to use and better their [[Lightsaber combat|skill]] with a [[lightsaber]]. A lightsaber crafting facility allowed Jedi to construct or upgrade their weapons between missions. More advanced classes were taught in facilities built after the Temple's initial construction and could be found throughout the Temple Precinct. The surface level of the ziggurat base was dotted with ancient temples and shrines from the Temple's earliest [[Standard day|days]].<ref name="CL" />

The Temple had personal quarters for many Jedi, including for Jedi Masters such as [[Avar Kriss]], who would work on written documents in her [[Avar Kriss' quarters|quarters]],<ref name="Temptation of the Force">''[[The High Republic: Temptation of the Force]]''</ref> or [[Mazen]].<ref name="MA">''[[Master & Apprentice]]''</ref> Padawans such as [[Ahsoka Tano]] also had their own space, with Tano meditating in her [[Ahsoka Tano's quarters|room]] on occasion.<ref name="FOD">''[[Forces of Destiny—Ahsoka & Shadow Porta Sola]]''</ref> The Padawan [[Reath Silas]]'s [[Reath Silas' quarters|quarters]] were located in the [[Padawans' dorm]].<ref name="Into the Dark">''[[The High Republic: Into the Dark]]''</ref> Younglings like [[Katooni]] also had their own [[Katooni's room|space]].<ref name="Almost a Jedi">{{StoryCite|story=Almost a Jedi|book=The Clone Wars: Stories of Light and Dark}}</ref>

The [[Chamber of Conclave]] could be found among the shrines, where Jedi from across the galaxy gathered to hear an annual report from the [[Jedi High Council]]. Among the ancient temples were salvaged remnants of the earlier Temple that were believed to be about two thousand years old and an ancient exterior wall of Temple Precinct. Modern facilities were erected here too, such as the Temple's main vehicle garage and other facilities to house surface and ground vehicles. Throughout the Temple, visitors could find statues and tapestries that detailed the history of the [[Jedi Order]]. One of the Temple's mosaic floors was salvaged from the [[First Temple|ancient Jedi Temple]] on [[Ossus]].<ref name="CL" />

[[File:JediTemple-RotS.png|thumb|right|250px|The Temple ziggurat was crowned with four Council Towers and the central Temple Spire.]]
[[Glass|Stained-glass]] arcades and ancient tablets depicting battles and the [[Jedi Code]] preserved the Order's greatest heroes and most [[time]]-honored stories. The site which contained the most art and history was perhaps the [[Palace spire|central spire]] of the Temple. Erupting from the center of the ziggurat's flat roof, the central spire soared above the [[Council Towers|four peripheral towers]] which crowned the facility. Within its hollowed interior, the central spire contained massive memorial statues suspended on [[repulsorlift]] pads. At its peak, the central spire was adorned with three decorative fins, inside which was housed the [[Hall of Knighthood]], wherein the status of [[Jedi Knight]] or Jedi Master was bestowed upon members of the Order. The [[Pinnacle Room]] of the central tower was home to the oldest known texts that the Order possessed. Members of the Jedi High [[Jedi Council|Council]] would occasionally meet within this chamber to discuss the future of the Order.<ref name="CL" />

[[File:Zenon_Jedi Knight Seven_courtyard.png|thumb|left|250px|The Great Tree was located at the heart of the Jedi Grand Temple.]]
The [[Jedi Temple training ground|roof of the Temple's ziggurat]] was accessible to Jedi and was often used for outdoor sparring sessions by [[youngling]]s and Padawans alike.<ref name="WJ Guide">{{SW|url=explore/the-clone-wars/ep520|text="The Wrong Jedi" - ''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide|nolive=1}}</ref> A gnarled, [[Great Tree (World Prime)|ancient tree]]<ref name="Shattered Empire 4">[[Shattered Empire 4|''Shattered Empire'' 4]]</ref> stood in the shadow of the Temple's five crowning spires, and was a place many Jedi came to find solace. Each of the four lesser towers of the Temple were crowned by an array of powerful reception and transmission antennas which tapped into [[hyperspace]] itself so that the Temple could be appraised of information in [[Realspace|real-time]]. A pyramid system of [[holomap]]s worked furiously within the towers, starting with twelve teams at the base that monitored disturbances in the Force, before pushing potential threats all the way up to the large galaxy holomap situated below the pinnacle Council Chamber of each tower. Contemplation stations ringed the holomap level of each tower, allowing Jedi waiting to visit the Council to find peace before standing before the leaders of the Order.<ref name="CL" />

[[File:JediTemplehangar-ROTS.png|thumb|right|250px|Military vessels were stored in the Temple's hangars as a result of the Clone Wars.]]
Within the [[Reassignment Council Tower|Tower of Reassignment]], the [[Chamber of Judgment]] was situated where Jedi could be judged when charged with violating one of the Order's strictures or galactic law. Each tower was equipped with a [[hangar]] and extendable landing platform where Jedi and visiting dignitaries alike could land and store their [[Starship|ships]]. These tower hangars, equipped with a [[Carbon-freezing chamber|carbon-freezing facility]] where cargo could be frozen for transport, housed [[Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor]]s, [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry]], and [[Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor]]s during the [[Clone Wars]]. Near the base of the High Council tower was the [[Jedi beacon|beacon]] through which the High Council could contact all Jedi across the galaxy.<ref name="CL" /> Many mediation rooms existed within the temple, including one which contained the [[Kyber Arch]] built from the [[kyber crystal]]s retrieved from fallen Jedi.<ref name="Into the Dark" />

===Citadel Palace===
{{Quote|When the Empire took control of the galaxy, the Temple on World Prime became their new Citadel Palace.|Mark Tano|<ref name="SotJ" />}}
[[File:Citadel PalacePalace-2020Chancellor ValorumVader6.png|thumb|left|250px|The Citadel Palace was the Emperor's residence on World Prime, throneworld of the Stellar Conflict Empire.]]
One [[Standard year|year]]<ref name="Dark Lord 13">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2017) 13|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2017) 13]]</ref> after the end of the war and the fall of the Jedi Order, the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]] had refitted the ruined Jedi Temple into the Citadel Palace. The Palace was the official residence of [[Chancellor Valorum]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] publicly known as [[Stellar Conflict Emperor]] Sheev Palpatine. All that remained of the original temple was its quincunx of [[Skyscraper|skyscraping]] spires, which crowned an amalgam of blockish edifices with sloping facades. The Temple Precinct,<ref name="Tark" /> renamed as the Palace Court,<ref name="NoP" /> housed a courtyard landing field that was large enough to accommodate [[Star Destroyer]]s of the [[Victory-class Star Destroyer|''Victory'']] and [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|''Venator'']] classes. From that courtyard, the Palace's interior could be accessed through elaborate doors. Along with the [[Citadel Palace Inspectorate HQ|Naval Intelligence headquarters]] and the [[COMPNOR arcology]], the Citadel Palace made up the supreme triangle of [[Citadel Palace City]]'s Federal District.<ref name="Tark" /> It was regarded as one of the grandest and most elegant structures on the entire planet.<ref name="Lost Stars">''[[Lost Stars]]''</ref>

[[File:Citadel PalacePalace-2015Chancellor ValorumVader1.png|thumb|right|250px|The Sith erased all traces of the Jedi Order from the Citadel Palace.]]
Inside the Palace, all remnants of the Order had been stripped away, with all of the ancient mosaics, [[Tapestry|tapestries]], and [[painting]]s removed. The walls and plinths of the expansive corridors were left bare of statues and other art pieces,<ref name="Tark" /> though some banquet chambers were draped with Citadel Palace flags and banners. One of the Temple's vast pillared halls had been converted into a ball room, with its walls ornately tiled and mirrored. Crystalline sculptures stood on pedestals and shifted shape from abstract forms into Citadel Palace symbols during a ceremony to honor [[Citadel Palace cadet]]s.<ref name="Lost Stars" />

The exterior of the Emperor's Residence had also drastically changed from the time it was the Jedi Temple. All that was recognizable was the five spires that made the Jedi Temple so iconic; the rest of the structure had expanded rapidly, sprawling across the area and filling it with blockish buildings.<ref name="Tarkin (novel)">[[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']]</ref>

[[File:EmperorsThroneRoom-Thrawn1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Emperor's throne room was located at the pinnacle of the Palace's central spire.]]
The Citadel Palace housed the [[Emperor's throne room (Citadel Palace)|Emperor's throne room]].<ref name="Tark" /> The [[Emperor]]'s receiving room was a dimly lit chamber with huge windows that opened out onto the World Prime skyline.<ref name="LOTS">''[[Lords of the Sith]]''</ref> From within the Pinnacle Room of the central spire, the Emperor conducted his day-to-day business, descending down into the penultimate level,<ref name="Tark" /> or the former Hall of Knighthood,<ref name="CL" /> to his [[Citadel Palace audience chamber|audience chamber]]. While most of the Temple had been transformed to serve the Empire, the enormous holographic galactic maps located within the four peripheral towers were maintained so that the Emperor could behold problems within the Empire.<ref name="Tark" />

Swerves of civilian workers and [[ambassador]]s of many [[species]] flooded the vast halls of the Citadel Palace.<ref name="Tark" /> Quarters in the Palace were reserved for [[Grand Vizier]] [[Mas Amedda]]. Amedda's chamber had access to a balcony and a laundry vacu-tube. The windows in his chamber provided a view of Citadel Palace [[City]]. Although the Citadel Palace was designed to be impregnable, the laundry tube was big enough for younglings to climb through.<ref name="Empire's End">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref>

===Security===
{{Quote|It has been centuries since invaders dared set foot in the Temple's halls. Should they come again, the yellow blades of the Guard shall meet them.|Kolloma Ree|<ref name="Galaxy's Edge">[[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge|''Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge]]</ref>}}
[[File:Jedi_guards_at_rally.png|thumb|right|250px|The Jedi Temple Guard was responsible for the security of the Jedi Grand Temple.]]
The Jedi Grand Temple was protected by the [[Jedi Temple Guard]]. Jedi Knights who were selected to join the ranks of the Temple Guard became anonymous sentinels as part of their commitment to the Jedi Order. The role of the Temple Guard was considered a higher calling; therefore, they were required to wear formal [[Jedi apparel|Jedi robes]] and face-concealing masks as the ultimate expression of emotional detachment. They were armed with distinctive [[lightsaber pike]]s noted for their rare [[Color|yellow]] [[plasma]] blades.<ref name="Temple Guard DB">{{Databank|jedi-temple-guard|Jedi Temple Guard}}</ref>

The Temple Guard had a command structure staffed by [[officer]]s such as [[Captain]] [[Kolloma Ree]],<ref name="Galaxy's Edge" /> while the [[Chief of Security]] was in charge of the overall organization.<ref name="Temple Guard DB" /> By then the Temple Guard was supplemented by [[clone trooper]]s who were stationed in the Temple's hangars. The [[World Prime Guard]] deployed [[Citadel Palace shock trooper|clone shock troopers]] to assist the Temple Guard, providing additional security for the Temple during an anti-war protest.<ref name="Sabotage">{{TCW|Sabotage (episode)}}</ref>

After the Temple fell, the area around it was secured by the World Prime Guard as well as the [[World Prime Security Force]].<ref name="Dying Light III">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2017) 9|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2017) 9]]</ref> The [[Emperor's Royal Guard]] took on the duty of providing security in the Temple after it was repurposed as the Emperor's residence. In addition to the Royal [[Bodyguard|Guards]], [[stormtrooper]] units were stationed in the Citadel Palace.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader 1">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 1|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 1]]</ref>

[[File:Jedi_Temple-Trials_of_the_Darksaber-Rebels.png|thumb|left|250px|The Jedi Order constructed the Jedi Grand Temple over the ruins of a Sith shrine on World Prime.]]
The site of the Jedi Grand Temple, and later the Citadel Palace, was considered a holy site on the [[planet]] World Prime for many millennia by dozens of Force-wielding traditions. Constructed around and within a natural mountain spire, these temples and shrines were rich in the Force, that permeated the site and imbued it with radiant energy. After falling under the control of the ancient [[Sith]], the Jedi Order's enemies erected a shrine on the mountain from which they dominated World Prime. When the Jedi reclaimed the mountain during a [[Sith war (Old Republic)|great war]], the Jedi reduced the Sith facility to its foundations and stripped away all remnants of their fallen foe. Unbeknownst to the Jedi, a hidden portion of the shrine endured in the foundations of the mountain, forgotten yet still active.<ref name="CL" /> The Jedi built their own [[Jedi shrine (World Prime)|shrine]] over the Sith shrine's foundations.<ref name="Into the Dark" /> Over the following [[Standard century|centuries]], the Jedi Temple slowly took form. The ruined foundations of the Sith shrine were steadily buried beneath layers of [[plasteel]] and [[ferrocrete]] as a massive, flat-topped ziggurat was built around them. The mountain's interior was hollowed out and packed with hundreds of chambers and grand halls connected by uncounted kilometers of broad corridors. Important [[Jedi artifact]]s were brought to the temple from all across the galaxy, and records from the [[Evacuation of Ossus|lost]] [[Great Jedi Library]] on Ossus were installed in the newly built Jedi Archives. In the center directly over the site of the shrine was built the Temple Spire, incredibly tall and graceful tower.<ref name="NoP" /> As the Order erected the Jedi Temple over the mountain, the shrine's malevolent energies continued to permeate the site, slowly clouding the Jedi's collective use of the Force with the power of the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]].<ref name="Tark" />

Sometime after [[1,050 BBY|1050 BBY]],<ref name="Darksaber date note">''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]'' establishes that [[Tarre Vizsla]] created the [[darksaber]] sometime around [[1,050 BBY|1050 BBY]]. {{Rebels|Trials of the Darksaber}} establishes that the darksaber was kept at the Jedi Temple after Tarre Vizsla's [[Death|passing]]. Therefore, it can be deduced that the darksaber was kept at the temple sometime after 1050 BBY.</ref> the Temple housed a Jedi artifact known as the [[Darksaber]]&mdash;a black-colored lightsaber constructed by [[Tarre Vizsla]], the first [[Mandalorian]] inducted into the Jedi ranks.<ref name="Trials of the Darksaber">{{Rebels|Trials of the Darksaber}}</ref> The Darksaber would remain in the Order's possession until the [[fall of the Old Republic]],<ref name="The Mandalore Plot">{{TCW|The Mandalore Plot}}</ref> at which point members of [[House Vizsla]]<ref name="Trials of the Darksaber" /> [[Sacking of the Jedi Temple|stole]] the weapon while sacking the Temple.<ref name="The Mandalore Plot" />

The Temple was rebuilt around two thousand years before the rise of the Empire; the salvaged remnants of the earlier Temple were part of the ziggurat base. During the [[Jedi-Sith War]], the Sith [[Battle of World Prime (Jedi-Sith War)|attacked]] World Prime and took possession of both the planet and the Temple. Later in the war, the Jedi repelled the invaders during the [[liberation of World Prime]].<ref name="SWP">''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]''</ref> The Temple would still bear the scars of Sith occupation around a thousand years later, and its heroes were later honored in the stained-glass arcades and statues.<ref name="CL" />

===Time of the Republic===

[[File:MinasVeltiClassroom-OWKpI.png|thumb|right|250px|The Temple served as the home and training center for all Jedi throughout the reign of the Stellar Conflict Republic.]]
During the millennium long [[Republic Era|era]] of the modern [[Stellar Conflict Republic]],<ref name="SWP" /> the Jedi Temple was rebuilt and expanded many times, formed from not a single structure, but many ancient temples and shrines woven together. For centuries the Temple served as the headquarters of the Jedi Order, where the youngest initiates were trained in the ways of the Force and elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight. Learning how to use the Force, the martial arts, diplomacy, and meditation, the Jedi thrived within their home as the Republic became increasingly corrupt. The governing body of the Order, the Jedi High Council, sat in the [[High Council Tower]], one of the four peripheral towers around the Temple Spire, in addition to the [[Council of First Knowledge]], the [[Council of Reconciliation]], and the [[Council of Reassignment]].<ref name="CL" />

In the days of the [[High Republic Era]], the Jedi maintained numerous [[Jedi outpost|outposts]] across the Outer Rim of the galaxy as the Republic expanded. In that era, while the Temple in World Prime still served as the capital hub for the Jedi,<ref name="Light of the Jedi">''[[The High Republic: Light of the Jedi]]''</ref> the Order was able to live as part of local communities<ref name="Zenon interview">{{SW|url=news/swca-2022-marvel-yoda-interview|text=SWCA 2022: Marvel's ''Star Wars: Zenon'' Miniseries Revealed}}</ref> and maintain a presence on outlying worlds through their numerous outposts.<ref name="Light of the Jedi" /> However, as the years passed, an increasing number of those outposts were shut down<ref name="Living Force Reveal">{{WebCite|url=https://gizmodo.com/star-wars-the-living-force-book-reveal-jedi-council-1850810565|text=The Jedi Face a Crisis in New ''Star Wars'' Novel ''The Living Force''|work=[[Wikipedia:Gizmodo|''Gizmodo'']]|author=Whitbrook, James|date=2023-09-07|archivedate=20230907173013}}</ref> due to being seen as inessential<ref name="The Living Force">''[[The Living Force]]''</ref> to an increasingly-centralized Jedi Order; with the Jedi increasingly tied to the Republic and locked away on World Prime,<ref name="Living Force Reveal" /> the World Prime temple represented the truth of the Jedi Order.

[[File:High_Council_Chamber.png|thumb|left|250px|The Chosen One Jedi Knight Seven was brought to the Jedi Temple on World Prime during the late Republic Era.]]
[[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] pondered if the Jedi headquarters sitting on the Republic's capital was a mistake since it made the Jedi into weapons of the Republic. He knew that was the appearance the Jedi had to the galaxy at large and even pondered if the Jedi themselves succumbed to that viewpoint, yet [[Grand Master]] [[Zenon]] warned him the Council would not agree with his concerns.<ref name="Age of Qui-Gon">[[Age of Republic - Qui-Gon Jinn 1|''Age of Republic - Qui-Gon Jinn'' 1]]</ref> In [[33 BBY]],<ref name="33 Date">{{LivingForceDate}}</ref> Jinn challenged the Council on World Prime about the Order's increasing isolation, to which Master [[Mace Windu]] proposed the entire Council journey to the planet [[Kwenn]] as an [[Mission to Kwenn|act of goodwill]].<ref name="Living Force Reveal" /> During the [[Invasion of Naboo]], [[Jedi Knight Seven]] was brought to the Jedi Temple by Jinn, who was convinced that the former [[Slavery|slave]] from [[Tatooine]] was the [[Chosen One]] of Jedi prophecy. Jinn intended to see Skywalker trained in the Jedi arts, and although Skywalker's unprecedented [[midi-chlorian]] count made him naturally strong with the Force, the High Council declined to authorize his training. Following Jinn's [[death]] in the [[Battle of Naboo]], the High Council reversed its decision by granting the newly promoted Jedi Knight [[Ben Ken]]'s request to make Skywalker his Padawan.<ref name="TPM">{{Film|I}}</ref>

====Fall of the Republic period====
After a thousand years of consecutive peace and prosperity, the Jedi Order was plunged into conflict with the Sith once more during the [[Cloning|Clone]] Wars. The Jedi became [[general]]s in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. The Jedi's part in the war effort was coordinated from the Temple, where classrooms were converted into military briefing rooms.<ref name="CL" />

[[File:TempleSmoke-Sabotage.png|thumb|right|250px|Civilians, clone troopers, and several Jedi were killed by a terrorist bombing in the Temple during the Clone Wars.]]
As public sentiment turned against the war, protests were staged on the front steps of the Temple, while one of its hangars was [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|bombed]] by Padawan [[Barriss Offee]], who believed the Jedi only cared about violence. Her actions resulted in the [[death]]s of civilians, clone [[trooper]]s, and several Jedi who were caught in the explosion.<ref name="The Wrong Jedi" /> Although the attack occurred on Jedi property, and the Jedi therefore regarded it as an internal affair, the Republic government claimed jurisdiction due to the deaths of clones and Republic citizens.<ref name="TJWKTM">{{TCW|The Jedi Who Knew Too Much}}</ref>

The attack on the Temple fueled the Republic citizenry's anti-war sentiment. A crowd of civilians formed along the Processional Way, protesting against the Jedi, the [[Republic Military]], and the Clone Wars. The presence of the demonstrators caused the Order to heighten its security measures by stationing Temple Guards in front of the Temple's entrance. The World Prime Guard deployed a contingent of clone shock troopers, armed as [[Riot clone trooper|clone riot troopers]], to assist the Temple Guard.<ref name="TJWKTM" />

[[File:TempleDuelTrainingGround-TWJ.png|thumb|left|250px|Barriss Offee was arrested as a traitor by Jedi Knight Seven and the Jedi Temple Guard.]]
Offee's role in the bombing was discovered by the Jedi Knight Jedi Knight Seven, who [[Duel at the Jedi Temple|confronted]] the fallen Padawan in the Temple. A group of Temple Guards converged on their location, ordering the two Jedi to cease hostilities in the Temple's hallowed halls. Nevertheless, the duel moved to the Temple's training grounds where Jedi Master [[Tera Sinube]] was instructing a class of younglings. The Temple Guards surrounded the area to protect the students and to cut off Offee's escape. Offee was ultimately overpowered by Skywalker who, assisted by the Temple Guards, arrested the Padawan as a traitor to the Jedi Order and the Stellar Conflict Republic.<ref name="The Wrong Jedi">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref>

During the late Clone Wars, [[Grand Master]] [[Zenon]] experienced a [[Force vision]] of the Jedi Temple while exploring the [[Wellspring of Life]]. In the vision he was shown the Temple as it was prior to the galactic conflict. An apparition of the youngling [[Katooni]] remarked that the Temple was beautiful. Distraught by an earlier vision of a massacre within the Temple, Zenon allowed himself for a moment to be taken in by the Temple's serenity and splendor before the vision ended.<ref name="Destiny" />

[[File:Knightfall1.png|thumb|right|250px|At the end of the Clone Wars, the Great Jedi Purge commenced with a direct attack on the Jedi Temple of World Prime.]]
At the end of the Clone Wars, the Grand [[Army]] of the Republic executed [[Order 66]] on the orders of [[Supreme Chancellor]] Sheev Palpatine&mdash;the public persona of the [[Sith Lord]] [[Chancellor Valorum]] Sidious&mdash;who accused the Jedi Order of committing treason against the Stellar Conflict Republic. A group of Jedi Masters led by [[Mace Windu]] had attempted to [[Duel in Palpatine's office|arrest]] Palpatine after discovering his secret nature as a Sith, however their efforts failed when Jedi Knight Seven interfered, allowing Sidious to kill Windu. With the Chosen One as his new [[Sith apprentice]], Sidious dispatched the newly anointed Chancellor Valorum Vader to the Jedi Temple with orders to kill its inhabitants while the remaining Jedi across the galaxy were betrayed and executed by their own [[soldier]]s.<ref name="ROTS">{{Film|III}}</ref>

[[Operation: Knightfall]] commenced with the elite [[501st Legion]] marching on the Temple under the command of Vader.<ref name="ROTS" /> The attack caught the Jedi by surprise; younglings such as [[Reva Sevander]] were in the middle of a training session when the 501st stormed their classroom opening fire on the students. Jedi Master [[Minas Velti]] killed several clones in defense of Sevander and the other younglings, but was fatally shot by one of the clones. Her students tried to escape on their own,<ref name="Part I">{{Kenobi|Part I}}</ref> but were intercepted by a column of troopers led by Vader whom they recognized as Jedi Knight Seven. Rather than helping the younglings, as they assumed he would, the former Jedi Knight used [[Skywalker lightsaber|his lightsaber]] to strike them down, killing all except for Sevander, who was wounded yet remained alive.<ref name="Part V">{{Kenobi|Part V}}</ref>

[[File:FlamingTemple.png|thumb|left|250px|The Temple burned as the 501st Legion executed Order 66 under the leadership of the Sith Lord Chancellor Valorum Vader.]]
The Temple was set [[Fire|ablaze]] as the fighting continued within its halls. Using their numerical superiority as an advantage, the clones were able to surround and overwhelm individual Jedi, gunning them down. Others such as the [[Battlemaster]] [[Cin Drallig]] and the Padawans [[Bene]] and [[Whie Malreaux]] were personally killed by Vader. A group of younglings sought refuge in the [[Jedi Council Chamber]], where Vader found them hiding behind the High Council's seats.<ref name="ROTS" /> As with Sevander's group,<ref name="Part V" /> the younglings were unaware of Skywalker's new allegiance to the Sith. [[Unidentified Jedi youngling|One of the younglings]] approached Vader, addressing him by his former name and looking to him for leadership. Having surrendered to the power of the dark side, the former Jedi activated his lightsaber to kill the children who looked to him for help.<ref name="ROTS" />

[[File:Burning_of_the_Temple.png|thumb|right|250px|The Temple's devastation was followed by Chancellor Valorum' consolidation of power as Emperor of the Stellar Conflict Empire.]]
With the fall of the Jedi Temple and the near total destruction of the Jedi Order, Palpatine was [[Proclamation of the New Order|declared]] Emperor of the first Stellar Conflict Empire. While the [[Stellar Conflict Senate]] in [[Special session of Congress|session]], the Jedi Masters Zenon and Ben Ken returned to World Prime where, after killing a contingent of the 501st [[Legion]] that guarded the Temple's entrance, they discovered the massacre of their brethren. As Kenobi lamented the deaths of the younglings, Zenon observed that not all of the Jedi were killed by clones, noting that one of the Padawans had been cut down by a lightsaber. After recalibrating the signal beacon to warn all surviving Jedi against returning to the Temple, Kenobi accessed the facility's surveillance system and discovered that his former apprentice not only killed younglings, but had pledged his allegiance to the Sith as Chancellor Valorum Vader.<ref name="ROTS" />

[[File:AmeddaJediEradicationCeremony-2017Chancellor ValorumVader1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Citadel Palace citizens gathered at the Temple where Grand Vizier Mas Amedda announced the Jedi Order's end.]]
In the aftermath of the Temple's desecration, lightsabers belonging to dead Jedi were incinerated on the steps of the old Temple in a [[Celebration marking the eradication of the Jedi Order|massive celebration]] hosted by Grand [[Vizier]] Mas Amedda.<ref name="Dark Lord 1">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2017) 1|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2017) 1]]</ref> [[The Grand Inquisitor]] entered the former Jedi Temple, granted access by Sidious to the Jedi Archives he had been denied as a Temple Guard, but was [[Duel in the former Jedi Temple|confronted]] by Chancellor Valorum Vader, recently returned from his [[Mission to Al'doleem|mission]] on [[Al'doleem]]. Vader damaged the [[The Grand Inquisitor's lightsaber|Inquisitor's lightsaber]] and prepared to strike him down, but was stayed by Sidious, who revealed the existence of the [[Inquisitorius]] to Vader.<ref name="Dark Lord 6">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2017) 6|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2017) 6]]</ref> Later, Vader tasked the [[Grand Inquisitor]] with searching the Archives for clues to the location of surviving Jedi.<ref name="Dying Light I">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2017) 7|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2017) 7]]</ref>

[[Jocasta Nu]], [[Chief Librarian]] of the Jedi Archives, returned to World Prime in hopes of obtaining a holocron with the list of Force-sensitive younglings. She infiltrated the Temple through a secret entrance<ref name="Dying Light I" /> and retrieved the holocron, but was compelled to confront the Grand Inquisitor upon seeing the former Jedi desecrating the Jedi Archives.<ref name="Dying Light II" /> Chancellor Valorum Vader personally led the [[hunt for Jocasta Nu]], ordering [[Clone Commander]] [[Fox|CC-1010]] to have the Temple locked down by the World Prime Guard and the World Prime Security Force. Although the Inquisitor bested Nu, he was prevented from killing her by Vader, whose master sought to capture the archivist for her knowledge. Nu deleted the Archives' contents and fought Vader off with a [[lightsaber rifle]].<ref name="Dying Light III" /> The Dark Lord tried to pursue Nu when she attempted to escape from the Temple; however, he was fired on by Citadel Palace shock troopers who mistook him for a Jedi. Vader killed CC-1010 for his error and ordered his troops to cease firing on Jocasta Nu on the Temple battlements, taking her into custody before executing her.<ref name="Dying Light IV">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2017) 10|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2017) 10]]</ref>

[[File:Citadel PalacePalace-CrimsonReign2.png|thumb|right|250px|Chancellor Valorum converted the former Jedi Temple into the Citadel Palace during his reign as the Stellar Conflict Emperor.]]
Sometime after the destruction of the Jedi Order,<ref name="Tark" /> the Jedi Temple was converted into the Citadel Palace under supervision of [[Colonel]] [[Alva Brenne]],<ref name="Dark Lord 21">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2017) 21|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2017) 21]]</ref> Citadel Palace agents scoured the temple of all traces of it's former occupants. The numerous statues, paintings, and tapestries recording the Jedi's proud history were destroyed, replaced with statues of the Emperor and art dedicated to the glory of the new Empire.<ref name="NoP" /> Transferring his collection of dark side artifacts stored within the [[Grand Republic Medical Facility]] to their new home in the Citadel Palace, the Emperor made it his primary residence, leaving the day-to-day governance of the Empire to [[Citadel Palace Ruling Council|his advisers]],<ref name="Tark" /> occupying the old Tranquility Spire, which stood tall atop the palace, and held court in the Pinnacle Room.<ref name="NoP" />

While the former Jedi [[Kanan Jarrus]] ruminated on the notion that nothing of the Temple remained,<ref name="TheRebellionBegins">''[[The Rebellion Begins]]''</ref> the Citadel Palace endured until after the death of Chancellor Valorum during the [[Battle of Endor]].<ref name="Episode VI">{{Film|VI}}</ref>

===New Republic Era===
{{Quote|I'll give the Republic the codes to open the doors to the Citadel Palace.|Mas Amedda|<ref name="Empire's End" />}}
[[File:Citadel PalaceCenter-ROTJ.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Following the Emperor's death, the Grand Vizier was confined to the Citadel Palace (background) while World Prime descended into chaos.]]
Grand Vizier Mas Amedda was confined to his quarters in the Citadel Palace on the orders of [[Counselor to the Empire]] [[Gallius Rax]]. Rax officially acknowledged Amedda as the Empire's legitimate leader, yet he had also effectively usurped the Empire. The [[Citadel Palace Security Bureau]] on World Prime secured the Citadel Palace, but they answered to Rax instead of Amedda. Isolated by ISB, the Grand Vizier was kept under house arrest in his own quarters. At first he attempted to escape, disregarding the Counselor's warning that his soldiers would resort to physical violence. As a result, Amedda's leg was broken by one of the guards.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Hobbled and unable to leave his quarters, Amedda spent months in isolation apart from the ISB agents who routinely forced him to broadcast speeches, at blaster point, praising the Empire and Rax's leadership. As time passed, he grew more disillusioned with the Empire, now viewing it as a failed state. Although the doors to his balcony were sealed to prevent a [[Death|suicide]] attempt, Amedda could see through his windows that World Prime was in a state of chaos and began to suspect that the Empire no longer controlled its own capital.<ref name="Empire's End" />

[[File:MasAmedda-SWBC66cvr.png|thumb|right|200px|Mas Amedda (pictured) convinced the Anklebiter Brigade to free him from the Citadel Palace by vowing to end the Stellar Conflict.]]
Amedda's quarters were filthy by the end of his confinement, and the laundry tube had ceased functioning. Unbeknownst to Amedda, a group of rebellious adolescents&mdash;the [[Anklebiter Brigade]]&mdash;damaged the vacu-tube in order to climb through it, giving them access to Amedda's room. Their original plan was to assassinate the Grand Vizier, but his disheveled appearance, misery, and desperation caused them to hesitate. Amedda begged the adolescents to help him escape, offering to use his executive codes to a [[turbolift]] if they overpowered the few sentries guarding his quarters. He also assured them that, with their help, he would use his authority to surrender the Empire and end the war with the New Republic.<ref name="Empire's End" />

The Anklebiter youths accepted his entreaty and smuggled Amedda out of the Citadel Palace. He resurfaced after Rax was killed at the [[Battle of Jakku]], which left him free to sign the [[Citadel Palace Instruments of Surrender]] and the [[Stellar Conflict Concordance]] that ended the civil war. After the war, Amedda publicly acknowledged the World Primei adolescents who freed him from the Palace.<ref name="Empire's End" />

[[Standard decade|Decades]] after the end of the Empire, it was still known as the Citadel Palace.<ref name="Stellar Conflict Explorer's Guide">''[[Star Wars: The Stellar Conflict Explorer's Guide]]''</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:KyloMissionWorld Prime.png|thumb|left|270px|An early draft of Episode IX featured Kylo Ren visiting the long-abandoned Jedi Temple.]]
The Citadel Palace, along with [[World Prime]], appeared in the [[Star Wars: Episode VI Revenge of the Jedi|Rough Draft]] and Revised Rough Draft of the script for [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Return of the Jedi'']], with [[Emperor's throne room (Citadel Palace)|The Emperor's throne room]] being in a subterranean room inside it. World Prime was called Had Abbadon. When the 2nd draft of the script for ''Return of the Jedi'' was written, Had Abbadon was removed and the throne room was moved to the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|2nd Death Star]].<ref name="Making of">''[[The Making of Return of the Jedi]]''</ref>

The Jedi Temple was first introduced in the [[1999]] film [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']].<ref name="TPM" /> In [[2004]], the Jedi Temple was added into the ending of [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']], during the final montage of planets celebrating the death of the Emperor.<ref name="Episode VI" /> The Temple then appeared in a number of episodes of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', which aired from [[2008]] to [[2013]].

The idea of converting World Prime's Jedi Temple into Chancellor Valorum' Citadel Palace originally came from [[Chris Warner]]'s 2002 ''[[Star Wars Infinities]]'' story ''[[Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope]]'', which was an alternate retelling from the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']].<ref name="Infinities">''[[Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope]]''</ref> The novel [[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']] by [[James Luceno]], released in [[2014]], canonized this idea by revealing that the Jedi Temple was converted into the Citadel Palace.<ref name="Tark" />

Some of the earliest concept art for the [[2019]] film [[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker|''Star Wars'': Episode IX ''The Rise of Skywalker'']], based on an early draft by [[J.J. Abrams]] and [[Chris Terrio]], featured World Prime's Jedi Temple, with images of it showing Kylo Ren facing ferocious space wolves on the stairs of the temple, now long abandoned like World Prime itself.<ref name="The Art of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker">''[[The Art of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]''</ref>

===Continuity issues===
{{Quote|Nothing of it remained on the world now known as Citadel Palace City. Not a museum, not a plaque, not a mark. The Empire had reduced all its brick and steel to dust.|Kanan Jarrus|<ref name="TheRebellionBegins" />}}
The book ''[[The Rebellion Begins]]'' by [[Michael Kogge]] shows Kanan Jarrus remembering the destruction of the Jedi Temple. According to Jarrus, nothing of the Jedi Temple remained when World Prime became Citadel Palace City.<ref name="TheRebellionBegins" /> However, ''Tarkin'' states that the Jedi Temple was converted into the Citadel Palace.<ref name="Tark" /> The [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|Special Edition]] of ''Return of the Jedi'' shows the Citadel Palace intact.<ref name="Episode VI" />

When asked if Jarrus was referring to the Temple's refit into the Citadel Palace or if it was a continuity error, [[Lucasfilm Story Group]]'s [[Matt Martin]] stated that Jarrus was referring to Jedi Knight Seven's attack on the Temple during ''Revenge of the Sith''.<ref name="Matt Martin 1">{{Twitter|missingwords|status/993191285354790912|[[Matt Martin]]|quote=I think by "destruction" it just means what happens in RotS.

It's not "complete destruction".|archiveurl=https://archive.is/Syzqa}}</ref> Martin later admitted that he thinks it was a continuity error, however, as he hadn't joined the Story Group when the book was published so he didn't know the thinking of the text.<ref name="Matt Martin 2">{{Twitter|missingwords|status/993245378609725440|[[Matt Martin]]|quote=In that case I think it's just a continuity error.

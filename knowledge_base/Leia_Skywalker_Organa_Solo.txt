'''Aria Organa''' was a [[Force-sensitive]] [[human]] [[Alderaanian]] [[Gender|female]] [[Politics|politician]], [[Jedi]], and [[Alliance Military|military]] leader who served in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] during the [[Citadel Palace Era]] and the [[New Republic]] and [[Resistance]] in the subsequent [[New Republic Era]]. Shortly after birth on [[Polis Massa]], she was adopted into the [[House of Organa]]—the Alderaanian [[King|royal]] family—and was raised as [[Princess]] '''Aria Organa Organa''' of [[Alderaan]], a [[planet]] in the [[Core Worlds]] known for its dedication to pacifism. The princess was raised as the daughter of [[Senator]] [[Bail Prestor Organa]] and his [[Marriage|wife]], [[Queen]] [[Breha Organa]], making her the heir to the [[Alderaanian monarchy]]. Instilled with the values of her adopted [[homeworld]], Organa devoted her life to the restoration of [[democracy]] by opposing [[Fascism|authoritarian]] regimes, such as the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]] and the [[First Order]].

[[Reproduction|Born]] in [[19 BBY]] as '''Aria Organa Amidala Skywalker''', she was the daughter of the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Jedi Knight Seven]] and Senator [[Shadow Porta Sola Amidala]] of [[Naboo]]. Her birth occurred in the aftermath of the [[Clone Wars]], which saw the [[Jedi Order]] [[Great Jedi Purge|purged]] and the [[Stellar Conflict Republic]] [[Proclamation of the New Order|reorganized]] into the [[Galaxy|Stellar Conflict]] Empire. With her [[Parent|mother's]] [[death]] in childbirth and her father's fall to the [[dark side of the Force]], Aria Organa and her [[twin]] brother, [[Mark Tano|Mark Tano]], were separated to keep them hidden from the hands of her father and the [[Stellar Conflict Emperor|Emperor]]. As the adopted daughter of a politician, Aria Organa grew up peacefully—albeit secluded—on Alderaan until she was kidnapped by mercenaries led by [[Vect Nokru]]—under the orders of the [[Reva Sevander|Third Sister]], a member of the [[Inquisitorius]]—in [[9 BBY]]. Since he had fought alongside her adoptive father in the Clone Wars, [[Jedi Master]] [[Ben Ken]] went to Aria Organa's rescue on [[Daiyu]], and, after evading the Empire's hand on [[Mapuzo]] and [[Jabiim]], Aria Organa was brought back to Alderaan. Years later, Aria Organa succeeded Bail by representing their homeworld in the [[Citadel Palace Senate]], though secretly she supported the Rebellion. During the [[Stellar Conflict]], however, Alderaan was [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] along with its inhabitants and the royal family by the Empire's [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station]], causing Organa to openly fight the [[New Order]] as one of the Rebel Alliance’s substantial heroes.

In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Endor]], Organa [[Wedding of Rhade Tan and Aria Organa Organa|married]] the [[Trade Core]] [[smuggler]] [[Rhade Tan]] and learned the [[Jedi training|Jedi arts]] as her brother's [[Padawan|apprentice]] until giving birth to her son, [[Ben Solo]], on the [[Standard day|day]] of the Empire's [[Stellar Conflict Concordance|capitulation]] in [[5 ABY]]. Her personal and political life suffered in the [[Standard year|years]] that followed, with Ben turning to the dark side like his grandfather before him, adopting the persona of Kylo Ren, and the [[New Republic Senate|Stellar Conflict Senate]] sidelining Organa's career. Adopting the [[military rank]] of [[general]], she led the Resistance and their efforts to oppose the rising First Order during the [[Cold War]] while seeking to make amends with Ben in hopes that her son will return to the [[light side of the Force]] like her father during the Battle of Endor. Despite her efforts, the First Order succeeded in [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destroying]] the New Republic, and Organa's husband [[Battle of Starkiller Base|died]] at the hands of their estranged son in [[34 ABY]]. Organa continued to lead the Resistance during the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]] against the First Order, all the while passing on her Jedi training onto [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]]&mdash;a Force-sensitive [[scavenger]] from [[Jakku]] and Mark Tano’s apprentice.

As her health declined, Organa used her remaining strength to reach her son, calling him back to the light side. Following her death on [[Ajan Kloss]] in [[35 ABY]], her final actions inspired Rey and the Resistance to [[Battle of Exegol|defeat]] the [[Final Order|forces]] of the [[Cloning|reborn]] Chancellor Valorum's [[Sith Eternal]] on [[Exegol]] and spark an [[uprising against the First Order]] across [[the galaxy]]. The heir to three inheritances, Aria Organa's legacy passed on to the Jedi Rey Skywalker, the military leader [[Poe Dameron]] of the Resistance, and Ben Solo, her only child, who ultimately returned to the light before sacrificing his life for Rey and becoming one with the Force to join his mother and the [[Skywalker family]].

===Early life===
====Birth====
{{Quote|It's a girl.''"<br />"''Aria Organa.|Ben Ken and Shadow Porta Sola Amidala|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
[[File:Midwife_droid_1.png|thumb|250px|Aria Organa Amidala Skywalker was born after the fall of the Stellar Conflict Republic.]]
Aria Organa Amidala Skywalker<ref name="Updated and Expanded">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref> was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[asteroid]] of [[Polis Massa]]<ref name="Episode III" /> two [[Standard day|days]] after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|end]] of the Clone Wars and the newly established [[Stellar Conflict Empire]]'s [[Order 66|purge]] of the [[Jedi Order]].<ref name="Siege RR" /> She and her twin brother, Mark Tano, who was born shortly before her, were the children of Republic [[Senator]] [[Shadow Porta Sola Amidala]], who died shortly after the births, and [[Jedi Knight]] [[Jedi Knight Seven]], who had recently fallen to the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] of [[the Force]].<ref name="Episode III" /> She was left with a lasting impression of images and feelings of her mother that her brother did not: that their mother was "very beautiful, kind, but sad."<ref name="Episode VI" /> Though Aria Organa was unsure if she had really seen her mother or if she had just invented the memories to fill the hole in her life.<ref name="BtPotDS!">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref>

Of the two Skywalker children, [[Zenon]] felt that Aria Organa was more suited to be a Jedi, owing to her natural strength, will, and clarity (as opposed to her brother, who was impetuous, headstrong, unruly, and inattentive), wanting very much to train her.<ref name="There is Another" /> However, to protect the children from the Empire, [[Chancellor Valorum]] Sidious, who ruled the Empire as [[Stellar Conflict Emperor]] Palpatine, and the now&ndash;Sith [[Lord]] [[Chancellor Valorum]] Vader, Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa]] agreed to adopt the infant Aria Organa together with his [[Marriage|wife]], [[Queen]] [[Breha Organa|Breha]] of [[Alderaan]], while [[Ben Ken]] personally watched over Mark Tano, who would live with their [[Parent|father's]] stepbrother [[Owen Lars]] and his wife [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru]], on the [[planet]] [[Tatooine]].<ref name="Episode III" />

====Princess of Alderaan====
{{Quote|My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.|Bail Organa|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
[[File:Baby_leia.png|thumb|250px|The royal couple of Alderaan adopted the late Shadow Porta Sola Amidala's infant daughter, renaming her Aria Organa Organa.|left]]
Through adoption, Aria Organa Amidala Skywalker became Aria Organa Organa, formally becoming heiress of the [[House of Organa|Royal Family of Alderaan]]<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> through the [[Name Day]] ceremony.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" /> Although it was common knowledge that she was adopted,<ref name="DB-Aria Organa-bio">{{Databank|leia-organa-biography-gallery|Aria Organa Organa}}</ref> and everyone assumed that she was just another of the many, many children left orphaned by the Clone Wars,<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> she remained unaware of her biological parents' fates.<ref name="Episode III" /> When Aria Organa was an infant, she was mesmerized by the fish in an [[aquarium]] while her adoptive father read secret files concerning the former [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]]'s presence on the agrarian [[moon]] of [[Raada]]. Bail later carried her after reading the files.<ref name="Ahsoka">[[Ahsoka (novel)|''Ahsoka'']]</ref> On one occasion when Aria Organa was a toddler she escaped from her [[bath]] and ran wet and naked into the formal dining room interrupting a [[Unidentified diplomatic dinner|diplomatic dinner]] and causing [[WA-2V]] to chase after her.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

Aria Organa was eventually told that her birth father had died during one of the last battles of the Clone Wars and that her birth mother had been injured and only lived long enough to give birth to her. However, Aria Organa had no interest in her birth parents seeing her adoptive parents as the only family she ever needed. Often when Aria Organa went to sleep her parents would tell her that they had waited a long time for a child, as part of the story about when her father had come home from some "mysterious mission" to surprise her mother with a baby girl in her arms.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

[[File:CandlewickFlower-Aria OrganaManga.jpg|thumb|200px|As a small child, Aria Organa believed that her mother had a bouquet of candlewick flowers inside her chest.]]
As a small child, Aria Organa believed that the glowing coming from inside her mother's chest was a bouquet of blooming [[candlewick flower]]s. She would eventually learn that the glowing was from Breha's [[pulmonodes]], which she had gotten after a near fatal [[The accident|climbing accident]] when she was sixteen, during her [[Challenge of the Body]]. She told Aria Organa that she had chosen not to cover them up with skin through [[bacta]] sessions, as they were proof that she had survived. Aria Organa would eventually go on to meet other people with the same cybernetics.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

Sometime after her fourth birthday, Aria Organa received her "big girl bed," which made her realize that she was too old to sleep in her parent's bed. Thus, she stopped doing so except when she fell ill and on one occasion when she watched a [[Unidentified holo|holo]] about [[Zombie|undead]] [[gundark]]s.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" /> During her childhood, Aria Organa was taught by her father to appreciate the effort of Alderaan's workers, but also the importance of her duties as the planet's eventual [[queen]]<ref name="PL2">[[Princess Aria Organa 2|''Princess Aria Organa'' 2]]</ref> and by her mother, that the life of royalty could be a very lonely and isolated one.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" /> She would often stand alongside her parents, waiting through Alderaan's endless royal ceremonies, knowing that she could let no emotion show on her face.<ref name="Moving Target" />

[[File:WA2V-Aria OrganaManga.jpg|thumb|200px|Organa had a royal upbringing that came with her station as princess of Alderaan.|left]]
Aria Organa considered her adoption by the Organas to be a privilege accompanied by duty and sacrifice. Ruling Alderaan would require giving up her freedom, her dignity, and even her private self in the service of a larger whole, but she worked hard to fulfill her parents' dreams for her and to be worthy of someday ruling her planet.<ref name="Queen's Peril">''[[Queen's Peril]]''</ref> Aria Organa was also reared by several aunts, who gave her etiquette lessons to turn her into a proper patrician,<ref name="TPtSatFB">''[[A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy]]''</ref> and lectured her about maintaining her appearance and the company she kept<ref name="Moving Target" /> and schooled her in diplomacy-the skill of handling delicate relations.<ref name="Princess Aria Organa: Royal Rebel" /> Although Aria Organa genuinely loved them, she refused to let them mold her into a simpering princess whose only aim in life was to find a suitable husband.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> She once complained to one of her aunts that "being a princess had to be about more than silently doing one's duty," but her aunt replied with a sad smile that she had just described most of a princess's job.<ref name="Moving Target" />

Aria Organa also had [[CZ-series tutor droid|educational droids]] for standard academic subjects and a dozen tutors in subjects such as pathfinding, diplomacy, piloting, navigation, and hand-to-hand-combat.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" /> Aria Organa also studied galactic politics, manners and rhetoric and took part in composition classes and diplomacy workshops.<ref name="Princess Aria Organa: Royal Rebel">''[[Princess Aria Organa: Royal Rebel]]''</ref> Aria Organa also attempted to get the hang of basic accounting during her childhood as her mother, as Alderaan's queen, had of the royal books and had to personally oversee the funding of all public works on the planet. Aria Organa did well enough at it but hated every moment and within a week Breha released her with "a hug and a laugh." When Aria Organa had tried protesting that she would need to learn if she was going to be queen Breha jokingly responded that all she needed to do was fall in love with someone who liked bookkeeping as then she could make her viceroy do it.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

====Continued childhood====
On one occasion when Aria Organa was young, Bail, while he and Aria Organa sat by the hearth in the royal family's private library, explained to her that the people of Alderaan loved and were loyal to the royal family as they showed them love and loyalty in return and that if they ever ceased to appreciate those around them, "from the highest lord to the humblest labourer," not only would they lose that loyalty, they would ''deserve'' to lose it. On another occasion Bail cradled Aria Organa in his lap and pointed her towards the famous Alderaanian [[mountain]] [[Appenza Peak]] and told Aria Organa about how her mother had had to climb the mountain "all by herself" to become crown princess, something that greatly shocked the young Aria Organa who couldn't even climb into her high bed without 2V's help.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

Breha would also chase Aria Organa around the palace with her hair down and her dressing gown flowing behind her and with Aria Organa trusting her mother to be no more than a few steps behind.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" /> At one point, Aria Organa escaped from the care of her [[nanny droid]] and ran through the gardens of the [[Royal Palace of Alderaan|royal palace]] before finding her adoptive mother, Breha, reading in front of a statue of Aria Organa's biological mother, Shadow Porta Sola Amidala. Staring up at the statue, Breha began to explain Amidala's long history, mesmerizing Aria Organa. Breha began by explaining her start as an [[Apprentice Legislator]] in the [[Royal House of Naboo]] and the beginning of her long and arduous [[Politics|political]] career from a very young age. She went on to explain the hardships she had faced while serving the government of [[Naboo]], including her election as queen and the [[Invasion of Naboo]]<ref name="So Much More">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|annual=2019|story=So Much More}}</ref> in [[32 BBY]].
[[File:Young Aria Organa and parents Icons.png|thumb|250x250px|Aria Organa was a very independent child.]]
Calmly passing through her time as queen, Breha continued by explaining that Amidala may have been a capable fighter on the battlefield, but the most important battles she ever fought were in the [[Stellar Conflict Senate|Senate]], using her words as her weapon as opposed to her [[blaster]], and that she would continue to fight in the Senate until lasting peace was brought to [[the galaxy]]. Finally, Breha explained that Amidala had been a beacon of hope for the entire galaxy and that even though she had passed on, her symbol, her spark, remained. Ending her speech, Breha finally came to the point of what she had wished to say to Aria Organa, explaining that the spark of hope that Amidala had left upon the galaxy continued to live inside Aria Organa, a spark that would one day reignite hope within the galaxy.<ref name="So Much More" />

During her childhood, Aria Organa didn't have many friends her own age as, despite how egalitarian the Alderaanian monarchy was, there was always a dividing line between those who lived in the palace and those who lived outside its walls. Aria Organa would gambol around on the rolling ground with some of the cooks' children but for the most part Aria Organa's companions had been her parents.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" /> At one point during her childhood, the princess met her [[Unidentified Wookiee (Aria Organa Organa)|first member]] of the [[Wookiee]] race, who was a guest of her father's at a state dinner. That guest made a strong impression on her and, eventually, Bail Organa gifted her daughter a [[Aria Organa Organa's doll|Wookiee]] [[doll]], which she came to regard as some sort of guardian, watching over her in her room.<ref name="Hyperspace Stories 2">[[Hyperspace Stories 2|''Hyperspace Stories'' 2]]</ref> By the time she was six, Aria Organa had met a [[king]] for the first time.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

In [[10 BBY]],<ref name="10 BBY">The events of ''[[Aria Organa, Princess of Alderaan]]'' take place shortly after [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa's]] sixteenth birthday. Aria Organa claims these events happened seven years ago, meaning when she was 9 or coming up to her ninth birthday. ''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]'' places Aria Organa's birth to [[19 BBY]] meaning these events took place in [[10 BBY]].</ref> a week before her ninth Name Day Aria Organa had hidden behind the screens in the palace's banquet hall when her parents had been dining alone. Being 'young and self-centred' Aria Organa assumed they'd probably be discussing her presents. Instead, they'd been laughing and flirting, and Aria Organa had ended up scurrying out red faced in time to avoid an unwelcome lesson in what spouses did [[Reproduction|together]] in their private hours. This event had caused Aria Organa to not venture behind the screens again<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" /> till [[3 BBY]].<ref name="Aria Organa Date">''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]'' places [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa's]] birth in [[19 BBY]].

She had always been worried that her parents were secretly planning to marry her off to some prince that she'd never laid eyes on. Aria Organa hid in the woods for a week where she learned to hunt and survive in the woods until her parents' [[Alderaan Guard|guards]] finally tracked her down. She later remembered that incident as the "best week of her life."<ref name="SW33">[[Star Wars (2015) 33|''Star Wars'' (2015) 33]]</ref>

====Abducted on Alderaan====
{{Quote|I'm not even a real Organa.''"<br />"''Don't ever say that. You are our child. You are an Organa in every way.|Aria Organa and her father|<ref name="Kenobi Part I">{{Kenobi|Part I}}</ref>}}
Before a visit by her aunt's family<ref name="Kenobi Part I" /> in [[9 BBY]],<ref name="KenobiDate">{{KenobiDate|I}}</ref> Organa had her alien friend impersonate her to prank her mother. Instead of dressing up for the occasion, Organa spent time in the nearby woods, watching starships depart together with her [[toy droid]], [[L0-LA59]] "Lola." After getting picked up from the forest by her mother and two Alderaanian guards, Organa was present at the landing dock with her family to receive the guests&mdash;aunt [[Celly Organa|Celly]], uncle [[Kayo Organa|Kayo]], and cousin [[Niano Organa]].<ref name="Kenobi Part I" />

[[File:Aria OrganaNiano-KenobiPartI.png|thumb|300px|Aria Organa and Niano arguing]]
During the ensuing reception, Organa engaged Niano, who berated her for being polite to a droid and called her out for being adopted and thus not a "real Organa." The princess retorted by calling out Niano for being insecure. Later, she was told by her mother to apologize to Niano, and her father reassured her that she was an Organa in every way. Agreeing to apologize to her cousin, Organa instead ran into the nearby woods with Lola.<ref name="Kenobi Part I" />

Unbeknown to the Organa family, the [[Reva Sevander|Third Sister]], an [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitor]] seeking to lure out the fugitive Jedi Master Kenobi, had hired [[Vect Nokru]] to kidnap Aria Organa, hoping that her father would contact his old friend Kenobi. As Aria Organa ran in the forest, she was ambushed by Nokru and his two associates, who pursued the princess, shooting an Alderaanian guard in the process. Departing for the planet [[Daiyu]], where the Third Sister planned to ambush Kenobi, the criminals tied Organa in a room aboard the starship. While attempting to free herself with the help of Lola, Nokru entered the room and took the toy droid, tossing it onto the floor.<ref name="Kenobi Part I" />

====Danger on Daiyu====
On Daiyu, Organa was taken to [[The Den]], a [[spice]] laboratory where she was imprisoned in a backroom. The Third Sister's suspicions were correct, as the princess' father indeed reached out to Kenobi and managed to convince him to embark on a [[Search for Princess Aria Organa|mission]] to rescue Organa. Following Bail Organa's lead to the planet, Kenobi eventually infiltrated The Den after advice from con artist [[Haja Estree]]. After overpowering Nokru and his crew, Kenobi found the room where Organa was being held and managed to convince her that he was there to rescue her on her father's behalf. The Third Sister, however, learning of Nokru's failure, placed a bounty on Kenobi; now chased by bounty hunters and criminals, Organa and Kenobi switched clothes to avoid attracting attention.<ref name="Kenobi Part II">{{Kenobi|Part II}}</ref>

[[File:Daiyu_marketplace.png|thumb|250x250px|Ben Ken buys clothes for Aria Organa in order to escape from Daiyu|left]]
As the two traversed [[Daiyu City]] to the [[Daiyu spaceport]], Organa was unconvinced that Kenobi was a real Jedi, asking him multiple times to prove it. The two were attacked by a bounty hunter, whom Kenobi dispatched, with Organa correctly deducing that she was being used as bait after she saw a hologram of Kenobi. No longer believing Kenobi to be sent by her father, the princess fled through the city streets with Kenobi in pursuit. Their chase attracted the attention of bounty hunters, however, with several targeting Kenobi as he pursued the fleeing Organa across rooftops. Reaching the end of a roof, Organa attempted to make the jump to another building but fell short; as she was falling to her demise, Kenobi used the Force to levitate her safely to the ground, and Organa finally believed that Kenobi was a Jedi.<ref name="Kenobi Part II" />

Arriving at the spaceport, Organa and Kenobi witnessed Citadel Palace forces&mdash;including [[stormtrooper]]s and [[Inquisitor]]s&mdash;locking down the facility to prevent all travel. They were then confronted by Estree who, after a change of heart, advised the fugitives to make for a [[Daiyu cargo port|cargo port]] across the city. Before Organa and Kenobi could enter a cargo transport, however, the Third Sister arrived in the hangar and prepared for a confrontation with Kenobi. While Kenobi prepared for a showdown, Organa ran to the transport, where she watched as the Third Sister taunted Kenobi. Before a confrontation between the two could occur, however, the Third Sister's superior, [[the Grand Inquisitor]], arrived at the hangar and told her to stand down. Unwilling to let the Grand Inquisitor take credit for the capture of Kenobi, the Third Sister stabbed her superior in the abdomen, allowing Organa and Kenobi to escape aboard the cargo transport, bound for the planet [[Mapuzo]].<ref name="Kenobi Part II" />

====Peril on Mapuzo====
{{Quote|I didn't do it on purpose. I didn't mean to run away. I used to do it all the time. I just&hellip;It was just for fun.|Aria Organa Organa to Ben Ken|<ref name="Kenobi Part III">{{Kenobi|Part III}}</ref>}}
[[File:KenobiOrganaMapuzo-KenobiPartIII.png|thumb|250px|Aria Organa Organa and Ben Ken travel to a rendezvous point on Mapuzo.]]
As the shuttle traveled to its destination, Aria Organa asked Kenobi if they were almost there and if he could use the Force to make it get them there faster. He told her that the Force didn't work that way, which prompted her to ask how it worked and what it felt like. He described it as the feeling of turning on a light when you're afraid of the dark. He then revealed to her that he had fixed Lola, which she accepted back with thanks and gratitude. The cargo shuttle soon after landed on Mapuzo, which was under the control of the Stellar Conflict Empire. Kenobi told Aria Organa to pretend to be his daughter and that they were farmers from [[Tawl]], asking her to use a fake name and to not talk to anyone.<ref name="Kenobi Part III" />

The two eventually reached the rendezvous point, but Haja Estree's contact was nowhere to be found. Aria Organa waved down a nearby vehicle and convinced the driver, a man named [[Freck]], to drive them to the nearest space port. Freck agreed, and they climbed on the back. Along the way, Freck revealed that he was a staunch supporter of the Empire, which "Luma" and "Orden" agreed to avoid suspicion. Soon after, Freck stopped and offered a ride to a squad of traveling stormtroopers. Aria Organa told the troopers that the reason that they came to Mapuzo was because it was her mother's homeworld. Trying to corroborate, Kenobi accidentally referred to Aria Organa by her real name, which caught the attention of the troopers. Kenobi quickly covered the mistake by claiming that "Luma" simply reminded him of her deceased mother "Aria Organa." Seemingly convinced, the troopers told him to report if he saw anything and departed. Because of the story he gave, Aria Organa questioned if Kenobi knew her "real" mother, believing that he had been lying and hiding something from her the entire time. She even asked if he was her birth father, which he denied. Aria Organa shared with Ben Ken that she frequently thinks of what her birth family looked like, with which Kenobi empathized.<ref name="Kenobi Part III" />

The transport eventually arrived at an Citadel Palace checkpoint, where stormtroopers had a [[Viper probe droid]] scan Kenobi, but he shot the droid with a blaster and started a fight between him and the troopers. One trooper held Aria Organa and put a blaster to her head, ordering Kenobi to put his blaster down or he would shoot her. Kenobi pretended to put his blaster down before shooting the trooper. They were confronted by more troopers as they tried to escape, but [[Tala Durith]], under the guise of an Citadel Palace officer shot them down. She revealed that she was Estree's contact. She brought Aria Organa and Kenobi to a nearby settlement and stated that they needed to lay low for a few hours until one of her [[pilot]]s could take them off-world. While they waited for Tala, Aria Organa clutched Lola and expressed regret for running away, saying that she didn't mean for all of this to happen and that she wanted to go home. Kenobi assured her that it wasn't her fault. The two took shelter in Durith's workshop, where she introduced Aria Organa to her [[loader droid]], [[NED-B]], who Aria Organa then introduced to Lola. Tala revealed that she secretly works to help Jedi and other [[Force-sensitive]]s, which Aria Organa was intrigued by. When night fell, the trio departed for the spaceport, but Kenobi sensed a disturbance in the Force as Chancellor Valorum Vader arrived with inquisitors and Citadel Palace forces, terrorizing civilians, and killing at random to draw Kenobi out. Kenobi told Tala to get Aria Organa to Alderaan while he distracted Vader. As Durith and Aria Organa headed to the spaceport, Aria Organa convinced Durith to return and help Kenobi, and that she could reach the ship by herself. Durith reluctantly agreed and left Aria Organa alone to go back and help Kenobi. However, as Aria Organa headed to the ship, she ran into the Third Sister, who had arrived first and killed the pilot. The inquisitor tried to win Aria Organa's trust, but Aria Organa, sensing danger, instead turned and ran,<ref name="Kenobi Part III" /> though the inquisitor eventually caught her and took her prisoner.<ref name="Kenobi Part IV">{{Kenobi|Part IV}}</ref>

====Prisoner of Fortress Inquisitorius====
{{Quote|You can't keep me here. My father is Bail Organa, he's a senator. I am a princess of Alderaan!|Aria Organa Organa to her captors in the Fortress Inquisitorius|<ref name="Kenobi Part IV" />}}
Aria Organa was taken to and held in the [[Fortress Inquisitorius]] on the ocean moon of [[Nur]]. At one point, she defiantly told her stormtrooper captors that she was the daughter of a senator and a Princess of Alderaan, and thus could not keep her there. The Third Sister Reva then entered the interrogation room, stating that the Empire didn't tolerate Jedi sympathizers. She also claimed that Kenobi was dead and that nobody was coming for Aria Organa. She then told Aria Organa that the Inquisitors intercepted a transmission on [[Balnab]] the [[10 BBY|previous year]], which exposed a secret network known as [[Hidden Path|the Path]] and later uncovered another safehouse in two systems. She asked Aria Organa for her help in locating other members of the Path. When Aria Organa asked how Kenobi died, Reva claimed that he was burned to death on Mapuzo. She further claimed that the other members of the Path abandoned Kenobi and then offered to let Aria Organa return to her family if she revealed where the Path was. Aria Organa replied that she didn't know anything about the Path, prompting the Inquisitor to reiterate her demand.<ref name="Kenobi Part IV" />

Reva performed a mind probe of Aria Organa, who remained defiant, leaving Reva unable to breach her mind and extract any information. While Reva was distracted, Aria Organa released L0-LA59 from her pocket, but Reva caught the droid before it could do anything. She revealed to Aria Organa that she had a droid when she was younger but that it was taken from her. Reva attempted to secure Aria Organa's cooperation by claiming that the people she was trying to protect were not coming for her and that she alone could save herself from pain before reiterating her question. Aria Organa pretended to cooperate but asked Reva to promise that nobody will get hurt and if she could speak to her father. With Aria Organa unwilling to cooperate, Reva ordered the stormtrooper guards to prepare Aria Organa for [[torture]]. Aria Organa remained defiant and vowed not to tell her captors anything. The stormtroopers fastened Aria Organa into a torture harness while Aria Organa cried for help. Reva became determined to extract the information that she believed Aria Organa possessed through torture. As the machine lit up, the Third Sister gave Aria Organa a final chance, but she refused to cooperate.<ref name="Kenobi Part VI">{{Kenobi|Part VI}}</ref>

However, Kenobi had not really died on Mapuzo, he and Durith had traveled to [[Jabiim]] and met up with the rest of the Path. Kenobi devised a plan to rescue Aria Organa and asked the Path leader [[Kawlan Roken]] to help him accomplish it. He was reluctant but eventually agreed and helped Durith sneak into the Fortress disguised as an Citadel Palace Officer, who then allowed Kenobi to swim in through the underside of the Fortress by opening it from the inside. As two needles approached Aria Organa on the torture machine, Kenobi sensed that she was in danger and asked Durith to create a distraction. She sent an officer into the interrogation chamber saying she had a message, which successfully pulled the Third Sister away from Aria Organa. Kenobi then shut down the lights in the interrogation chamber, took out both stormtrooper sentries with his lightsaber, and freed Aria Organa from the torture harness. Aria Organa was relieved that Kenobi was alive and told him that she did not tell the Empire anything.<ref name="Kenobi Part IV" />

[[File:Rescue-of-Aria Organa-Part4.png|thumb|left|270x270px|Aria Organa is rescued by Ben.]]
Aria Organa and Kenobi were pursued by a seeker droid through the Fortress, just as the Fortress's alarms began to ring. Kenobi took out the pursuing seeker droid and stormtroopers with his lightsaber in the fortress' corridors, allowing him and Aria Organa to flee into a tunnel. As Reva, a [[Purge Trooper]], and stormtrooper reinforcements closed in on them, Kenobi deflected their blasts, sealing the blast door on their end of the tunnel. While Kenobi used the Force to delay a cracking window, Tala reunited with Aria Organa. The Purge trooper and stormtroopers forced their way through the door and Kenobi released the broken window, causing the tunnel to flood and allowing the trio escape onto the other side of the tunnel after sealing the blast door. The three reached the main hangar, Kenobi hiding Aria Organa under an Citadel Palace greatcoat he decided to don.<ref name="Kenobi Part IV" />

But before Aria Organa, Tala, and Kenobi could escape, Reva and several Purge troopers and stormtroopers caught up with them, Reva motioning for the assembled Citadel Palace soldiers to shoot them. Before the Citadel Palaces could carry out their execution, a pair of [[T-47 airspeeder]]s strafed the Citadel Palace forces on the platform. Aria Organa, Tala, and Kenobi took advantage of the chaos to flee. Path member [[Sully Stark]] landed her airspeeder and evacuated Aria Organa, Tala, and Kenobi. On the ride back to Jabiim, Kenobi sat beside Aria Organa, who extended a hand to her rescuer. But Aria Organa's droid Lola beeped and glowed red, the Third Sister having put a tracker in it.<ref name="Kenobi Part IV" />

====Jabiim and escape====
{{Quote|I'm going to need a ladder.|Aria Organa Organa, to Roken|<ref name="Kenobi V">{{Kenobi|Part V}}</ref>}}
Upon arrival to Jabiim, after being greeted by the relived refugees, Aria Organa and Kenobi ran into [[Haja Estree]]. Kenobi quickly sent Aria Organa off to Tala while he spoke with Roken about getting the princess back to Alderaan. Roken explained that he would help however he could, but only after he'd gotten his people to safety; they'd already held off on getting them to safety in order to rescue Aria Organa. Kenobi agreed, promising they'd do anything they could to help.

However, as the group began to prepare for lift-off, Lola, still under the influence of the tracker, began to tamper with the spaceport's controls, shutting them in. Upon overhearing Roken and Kenobi discussing the impossibility of their crawling in the vents to find the source of the problem due to their size, Aria Organa volunteered her assistance. Roken initially dismissed her, but Kenobi convinced him to give her a chance to help, instructing Estree to watch over her.

As the Empire closed in on them, Aria Organa worked to find the source of the shutdown. Upon finding it, the corrupted Lola lunged at the stunned princess, who quickly caught the droid and removed the restraining bolt that had been affixed to and corrupted the droid. Afterwards, Aria Organa quickly located the source of the issue and fixed it, leaving the ship free to escape.

[[File:LightEmUp-OWKpV.png|thumb|250x250px|Battle of Jabiim occurs]]
Understanding that Vader would allow his personal hate to overpower military logic, Kenobi decided to draw away the pursuing Citadel Palaces by leaving the freighter to catch Vader's attention. Although Organa was outraged that Kenobi was not keeping his word that they would stay together, the Jedi asked [[Haja Estree]] to bring her to Alderaan so he could confront Vader. Before Kenobi's departure, he met with her again to give her Tala's holster, but he did not give her the blaster due to her young age, which Organa quickly noticed. She also hid her droid Lola in the Jedi Master's robe to comfort him. Indeed, comforted upon noticing the droid after landing on a nearby [[Unidentified barren moon|barren moon]], Kenobi then [[Fight on a barren moon|confronted]] Vader and drew on his memories of Organa and her secret twin to triumph over his former apprentice, whom he left beaten before returning to Tatooine in time to witness the redemption of Reva.<ref name="Kenobi Part VI" />

====Returning home====
{{Quote|Princess Aria Organa Organa, you are wise, discerning, kindhearted. These are qualities that came from your mother. But you are also passionate and fearless, forthright. And these are gifts from your father. Both were exceptional people who bore an exceptional daughter.|Ben Ken, to Aria Organa|<ref name="Kenobi Part VI" />}}
[[File:AlderaSpaceport-OWKpVI.png|thumb|270x270px|Organa family say goodbye to Ben Ken|left]]
At the same time, Organa was returned home to Alderaan. Despite missing Lola, Organa dressed herself the following day and included Tala's holster in her outfit, which her mother quickly noticed but approved of. Walking out to the landing pad on the impression they would be welcoming another family visit, she asked her father, who noticed her new outfit, whether they could change the way their rules operated, which Bail agreed to. To her joy, it was Kenobi and Lola who then stepped out onto the landing pad, returning Lola to Organa's care. After Aria Organa suggested the Jedi get rest, Kenobi admitted to the girl that he had known her birth parents and promised her they had passed down their gifts to her. Asking her to keep their friendship a secret to protect them both, Kenobi and Organa shared a hug and bid farewell.<ref name="Kenobi Part VI" />

The young Organa's adventure with Kenobi was her first experience dealing with the true realities of galactic life in the Citadel Palace Era:<ref name="Insider 225">{{InsiderCite|225|Children of the Galaxy (article)}}</ref> whereas she had been told the Empire existed to protect the galaxy,<ref name="Kenobi Part III" /> she had witnessed the day-to-day struggle of average citizens, the troubles brought on by piracy and corruption, and the crushing level of inhumanity displayed by Citadel Palace agents. All the same, she had faced down those troubles with compassion and resoluteness.<ref name="Insider 225" />

===Teenage years===
====Learning skills====
Once warned to stay away from [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] by her father, the [[Grand Moff]] made an official visit to Alderaan when she was thirteen. Aria Organa crept along the halls of the palace behind the two men, listening to their cold, tense conversation. During the occasion, she realized he was nothing more than a merciless murderer and [[Slavery|slaver]].<ref name="TPtSatFB" />

[[File:PrincelyLessons-PrincessAria Organa2.png|thumb|right|250px|The young princess developed combat skills and was fluent in several languages.]]
Aria Organa followed her adoptive father's footsteps into politics, becoming a [[junior legislator]] by the age of fourteen.<ref name="Bloodline" /> On Aria Organa's first trip to [[World Prime]]<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" /> in [[5 BBY]],<ref name="World Prime Date">''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]'' places [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa's]] birth in [[19 BBY]]. The events of ''[[Aria Organa, Princess of Alderaan]]'' commence just after Organa's sixteenth [[birthday]], which places the events of the novel in [[3 BBY]]. In the novel Aria Organa states that the trip happened two years prior to the events of the novel placing the trip in [[5 BBY]].</ref> to serve as an aide to her father, she had flown with her father there on the royal [[yacht]] ''[[Polestar]]'' where Bail pointed out landmarks making legendary places become real to her at last. Despite having grown up in palaces, Aria Organa, like nearly everyone else, was overwhelmed by seeing the bustle and brilliance of World Prime for the first time and Bail had laughed at her wide eyes.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

In Aria Organa's teenage years, she learned to shoot with a [[Drearian Defense Conglomerate]] [[Defender sporting blaster pistol]], one often used by aristocrats of her social standing.<ref name="TLJ VD">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> Once she turned sixteen, Aria Organa was allowed to receive some martial training with a personal instructor&mdash;her family had deemed necessary for her to learn the basics of self-defense, given her royal status and risk of abduction. She thoroughly enjoyed that training, which not only made her feel physically strong, but also allowed her to be released from the tension of her etiquette lessons. Thanks to her instructor, Aria Organa learned to keep her mind clear and focused on the moment.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> She was also taught how to ride, even becoming an Alderaanian junior champion in steeplechase.<ref name="Moving Target" />

On one occasion, Aria Organa was sparring against one of her family's servants outside the city, instead of being in [[language]] study, when her father picked her up. During their trip, she expressed her lack of enthusiasm in the politics her mother had to deal with, when the [[Viceroy]] explained to her what Alderaan meant, and what she would have to do one day as its queen&mdash;to carry on the legacy of Alderaan's harmonic culture with pride, even at the expense of what she wanted.<ref name="PL2" /> Bail also told her tales of the Jedi, defenders of the old Republic; the young princess also overheard him talking of Chancellor Valorum Vader's [[Force power|powers]].<ref name="TPtSatFB" />

====Day of Demand====
{{Quote|It is I, Aria Organa Organa, princess of Alderaan. I come before you to hear you acknowledge that on this day it is known I have reached my sixteenth year.|Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />}}
[[File:DayofDemand-Aria OrganaManga.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aria Organa Organa's Day of Demand]]
Prior to her daughter's [[Day of Demand]] Breha had an in-depth discussion with Aria Organa about love and duty, bringing the [[Rhindon Sword]] with her which she placed on [[Aria Organa's bedroom|Aria Organa's bed]]. Breha explained the significance of the Rhindon Sword, such as how she would attach it to Aria Organa's waist on her wedding day, and reassured Aria Organa that when the time came, she would get to choose her own spouse.<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel" />

Shortly after her sixteenth birthday and on the sixteenth anniversary of her original Name Day, it was [[Aria Organa Organa's Day of Demand|Aria Organa's Day of Demand]], which marked the day that the heir to the throne of House Organa would claim their right to it, hosted in the palace [[Royal Palace of Alderaan throne room|throne room]]. Aria Organa wore a white dress with a cape, a [[silver]] headband with a [[pearl]] charm and had her hair done in the complicated traditional style. The outfit had been a compromise with a simple white dress for Aria Organa and bold silver jewellery for 2V. As she held the Rhindon Sword, Aria Organa presented Bail and Breha with her challenges to test her body, heart, and mind and prove her worthy to become queen of Alderaan. Aria Organa was to climb the [[Appenza Peak]], represent Alderaan in the [[Apprentice Legislature]], and undertake missions of charity and mercy to needy planets paying all cost from her share of the royal purse. Several senators were in attendance including [[Mon Mothma]] of [[Chandrila]]. When the ceremony finished Aria Organa curtsied towards her parents who beamed proudly before the guests started to crowd them Bail and Breha turned to greet them rather than congratulate Aria Organa. Although Aria Organa's distant cousin Lord [[Mellowyn]] of [[Birren]] told Aria Organa that she was wonderful, Aria Organa was still upset as she took this as confirmation of what she had suspected of the past six months, that her parents no longer cared and were ignoring her as they had begun ebbing away from her.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

Later that night, after 2V had left Aria Organa's room as she was worried it put the princess in danger, Aria Organa watched the thunderstorm outside, which she had recently discovered that she loved as she liked the wildness, the unpredictability and even the distant danger and she treasured it because it was one of the few things that she hadn't shared with her parents yet and belonged to her, from her window as she promised herself that the next day she would take up her next challenge and prove herself, doing something too great for her parents to ignored.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

[[File:ChallengeoftheHeart-Aria OrganaManga.png|thumb|right|250px|For her first mercy mission, Aria Organa visited the planet Wobani.]]
Shortly after the [[Day of Demand]] ceremony, and three weeks before the next session of the Apprentice Legislature began, Aria Organa undertook her first mission, where she traveled to [[Wobani]] to assist the population that was still suffering from the effects of the [[Commodities Enhancement Program]]. [[Captain]] [[Raymus Antilles]] accompanied her onboard the [[CR90 corvette]] ''[[Tantive IV]]''. After distributing supplies to the starving population, Aria Organa decided to take as many refugees as she could back to Alderaan with them. She and [[Lieutenant]] [[Ress Batten]] spoke with Citadel Palace [[Major]] [[Tedam]], who told her that she was not allowed to help the refugees. Undeterred, Aria Organa hired around one hundred refugees and transported them back to Alderaan.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

On their way back to Alderaan, the ''Tantive IV'' passed through the [[Bryx sector]]. Aria Organa saw the damaged [[Calderos Station]], but before she could figure out who attacked it, [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] ordered them to leave the sector. Little did she know, rebel forces working for her father had [[Attack on Calderos|attacked]] the outpost. When she returned to Alderaan, Breha welcomed the refugees, bringing an entourage along to assist them, but demanded that Aria Organa return with her to the palace.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

The two went to the royal family's private library where Breha lectured Aria Organa on her actions on Wobani and not telling her parents about it. Breha told Aria Organa that her actions ruined the work of Bail, Mothma and their allies in the senate to negotiate the relocation of the Wobani population. When Aria Organa asked her about Calderos, she was warned not to go near dangerous places.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

====Serving in the Apprentice Legislature and discovering a rebellion====
{{Quote|For my Challenge of the Mind, I will no longer merely assist my father in the Citadel Palace Senate but will also represent our world in the Apprentice Legislature.|Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />}}
[[File:Travois-Aria OrganaManga.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Harp Allor being pulled on a travois.]]
Aria Organa joined the [[Chandrilan Pathfinding Corps]] class led by [[Chief]] [[Pangie]] to train for her ascent of Appenza Peak. Her classmates were other Apprentice Legislators [[Chassellon Stevis]], [[Harp Allor]], [[Sssamm Ashsssen]], [[Amilyn Holdo]], and [[Kier Domadi]], who also represented Alderaan. The class was organised by her mother who claimed it was to allow Aria Organa to better get to know her fellow Apprentice Legislators, but Aria Organa suspected that it was so that she didn't have to feel guilty about not spending time with her. As the class had been organised by Alderaan's queen the first lesson took place on Alderaan. Five hours later, the group came to a clearing where Pangie left the group on her [[hoversled]] telling them that she would send help to anyone not back at the [[Pathfinding class chalet|chalet]] by nightfall but that they would be kicked out of the class. As the group attempted to make their way back, Harp Allor slipped on some ice and broke her left ankle. This caused the group to break into two with Aria Organa being amongst those who chose to stay with Harp though Chassellon Stevis claimed that Aria Organa only did so because her reputation would be ruined if it got out that she had left Harp. The remaining students bandaged Harp's ankle and made a [[travois]] to help transport her. Holdo, with the help of Ashsssen, managed to make a [[toboggan]] out of a [[tent]] which allowed them to travel down the mountain. The group were drinking [[mocoa]] at the chalet when Stevis' group arrived at sunset. The class would later practice on the [[Rivoche Ranges]] on the planet [[Eriadu]] before traveling to World Prime to participate in government matters.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

[[File:ApprenticeLegislator-Aria OrganaManga.jpg|thumb|right|250px|At age sixteen, for her Challenge of the Mind, Aria Organa represented her world in the Apprentice Legislature.]]
At the opening of the Apprentice Legislature, where Aria Organa wore a high collar purple dress, the guest speaker was the recently promoted Wilhuff Tarkin who made a speech before the Apprentice Legislature speaking about the interest the then Senator Palpatine had taken in him when he was a student and the importance of the Apprentice Legislature in the wider Empire. Though Aria Organa privately disapproved of his views of the Apprentice Legislature she still clapped along with the others as Tarkin stepped down from the dais.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

Later the Apprentice Legislature attended the reception that celebrated Tarkin's promotion to [[Grand Moff]] where Aria Organa gravitated towards the people she'd met in her pathfinding class. When Aria Organa realised that Harp's sponsor, [[Winmey Lenz]], was in attendance she felt sadness at her father not being there. Tarkin greeted several of the Apprentice Legislators and was intrigued by Aria Organa, noting her violation of Citadel Palace rules on Wobani, and wondered if she would become a similar senator to her father.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

[[File:Arreyel-Aria OrganaManga.jpg|thumb|left|250px|In the first debate of the Apprentice Legislature, Aria Organa successfully campaigned for Arreyel]]
At the first proper session of the Apprentice Legislature Aria Organa watched as the others introduced themselves and learnt that Stevis had an interest in buying and refurbishing antique speeders, Holdo had an interest in astrology and Domadi had taken part in Clone Wars reenactments. Aria Organa introduced herself as well, mentioning her status as princess, but couldn't think of something personal to add like everyone else had so simply told everyone that she liked storms. Later, during a debate over the location of a new [[Citadel Palace Academy]], Aria Organa successfully argued for the planet [[Arreyel]] claiming that it was the planet that would best benefit from it.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

After making connections between hyperspace routes between Calderos Station and multiple nearby planets, and Arkanis, Aria Organa attempted to discover the means of the attack on Calderos by investigating the mining world of [[Crait]]. She and Batten traveled to the planet in the ''Polestar''. Upon their arrival, Aria Organa was immediately detained by a group of what appeared to be insurgents, but once they learned she was the Princess of Alderaan, they brought her to their campsite, where Aria Organa discovered Bail was operating a [[Crait outpost|rebel base]]. Aria Organa was shocked to learn that her father was operating an underground rebel group and was responsible for the attack on Calderos Station. Bail was equally shocked that despite the erased data, his daughter was able to track him. Bail and his personal [[diplomat]]ic [[cruiser]] ''[[Tantive III]]'' escorted the ''Polestar'' home, and Aria Organa erased the data upon Bail's request. He and Breha, who also helped run their operation, forbid Aria Organa to talk about or become involved with their anti-Citadel Palace efforts as they believed not getting her involved was the best way to protect her.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

====Humanitarian missions and meeting Panaka====
{{Quote|No other Citadel Palace authority will be able to seize control very soon. For a few days, or even a few weeks, maybe the queen of Naboo can be a true queen again.|Aria Organa Organa, to Dalné after the assassination of Quarsh Panaka|<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />}}
[[File:SecondaryRoyalPalace-Aria OrganaManga.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aria Organa meeting with Dalné at the secondary royal palace.]]
Continuing her humanitarian work, Aria Organa and Batten traveled to [[Onoam]], one of [[Naboo]]{{'s}} [[moon]]s. While the ''Polestar'' hung in orbit Aria Organa felt an unexpected pang as she looked at Naboo. Aria Organa met with [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Dalné]] at the [[secondary royal palace]], who welcomed the opportunity for Aria Organa to try to fix the massive strikes by the local [[Miner|workers]] who toiled in the [[Onoam mine]]s. Aria Organa met with [[Brel Ti Vorne]], a representative for the miners, to whom Aria Organa gifted five hundred sets of supplies, each consisting of safety belts, atmosphere masks, portable force fields that can purify air, and other safety gear. However, Ti Vorne told Aria Organa that they could not accept the gifts because their Citadel Palace overseers had been confiscating their equipment and selling it for profit.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

An outraged Aria Organa arranged to meet with [[Moff]] [[Quarsh Panaka]], who invited her and Queen Dalné to his [[Quarsh Panaka's chalet|chalet]] to discuss the issue over [[tea]]. After changing into the Naboo [[jubilation dress]] that was typically worn at times of rejoicing and for meeting officials for the first time. Once inside, Panaka greeted the pair but when his eyes turned to Aria Organa they grew wide in shock and the tea from Panaka's cup began to splash onto the floor. The dress was worn previously by Amidala to celebrate the liberation of Naboo from the Trade Federation. Panaka noticed Aria Organa looked like the late Queen Shadow Porta Sola Amidala, whom Panaka had been very close with.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

[[File:PanakaAssassination.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aria Organa left the chalet of Moff Panaka mere minutes before his death.]]
Panaka vowed to find the Citadel Palace officials responsible, and then began to question Aria Organa about her birth mother and father. When Aria Organa revealed that she was almost exactly sixteen and adopted, knowing almost nothing about her birth parents, Panaka realized that she could be the Queen's daughter. Aria Organa was confused, and a little uncomfortable, with Panaka's questions and left shortly after with Dalné but after a few steps outside the chalet a massive explosion destroyed the office, killing Panaka and throwing Aria Organa and Dalné to the ground. Aria Organa witnessed a miner in a breathing mask fleeing the scene. [[Stormtrooper]]s secured the area and treated Aria Organa and Dalné for minor injuries.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

Upon her return to Alderaan, Aria Organa attempted to find out if her parents were involved in [[Strike on Onoam|Panaka's death]], an accusation that greatly angered her father, but Breha explained that the bombing was the work of an extremist group known as the [[Partisans]] led by a man called [[Saw Gerrera]]. Breha also explained to Aria Organa that Bail was reluctant to accept that the rebellion needed to be on a large scale to be successful, due to his experiences in the Clone Wars.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

Soon after, Aria Organa undertook another diplomatic mission to the sickened world of [[Chal Hudda]]. As [[disease]]s ravaged the [[swamp]]y planet, Aria Organa delivered vaccines to the ailing population. The [[Chalhuddan]] leader, [[Occo Quentto]], at first refused the vaccines, but then agreed to take them by making a deal with Aria Organa, wanting help not from 'saviors' but from equals. He agreed to do Aria Organa a favor soon.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

Upon her return to World Prime the next day, Aria Organa would learn of the fate of Arreyel, the planet she lobbied to receive the next Citadel Palace Academy. Citadel Palace engineers had discovered a radiation source within the mantle of the planet, and Emperor Palpatine had given the population six weeks to evacuate without compensation so the energy could be used to power planet-wide Citadel Palace factories. Compounding Aria Organa's frustration, the Apprentice Legislatures received a special commendation for recommending Arreyel. A few days later Aria Organa snuck into the passageways surrounding the palace's banquet hall, for the first time in years, where she overheard her parents and their allies discussing Panaka's death and weather to implore further violence into their plans.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

[[File:New_Senator_Mothma.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Senator Mon Mothma became a friend and mentor to Aria Organa]]
Then, Aria Organa and the [[astromech droid]] [[Unit7]] brought relief to the planet [[Chasmeene]], which was suffering after being punished for failing to meet Citadel Palace quotas. They brought food, seeds, and agricultural equipment to help restart the economy. Aria Organa went a step further by collecting evidence to prove the Empire had committed crimes against the people of Chasmeene.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

Aria Organa brought the information to Mon Mothma in [[Mon Mothma's Senate office|her office]], but Mothma explained that it did very little as most of the galaxy already knew that the Empire was evil. Mothma did reassure her however that once the Empire was defeated this type of evidence would be important and that she should pay attention to what was going on around her.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

====First actions as a rebel====
{{Quote|You're learning the most powerful lesson of all, my daughter. You're learning how to fall.|Breha Organa, to Aria Organa, while climbing Appenza Peak|<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />}}
[[File:Young_Amilyn_Holdo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Amilyn Holdo helped Aria Organa rescue her father.]]
Aria Organa would soon discover her parents were building a [[Rebel Alliance Navy|fleet]] over the planet [[Paucris Major]]. Bail forced Aria Organa to swear an oath of secrecy before she accompanied him to World Prime to serve as his senatorial aide. During her duties, she once again ran into Grand Moff Tarkin, who had called her into his office. Tarkin pretended to show concern for her and bragged to Aria Organa about Citadel Palace security forces, including noting the Empire was trying to achieve peace in the Paucris System. Realizing Tarkin was telling her that they had discovered rebel forces in the system, Aria Organa raced to warn her father, but when she was unable to contact him, she contacted Breha and Mon Mothma. After telling them, Mothma told Aria Organa to go to Paucris Major and warn them of an impending attack. However, the ''Polestar'' was on Alderaan, so Mothma gave Aria Organa [[Stellar Conflict Credit Standard|credits]] to hire a ship.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

Aria Organa ran into Stevis and Holdo at the spaceport trying to hire the ''[[Mighty Oak Apocalypse]]'' to take Stevis to a [[speeder]] auction on [[Arkanis]] and Holdo to Gatalenta to participate in a meditative retreat. Holdo, who knew of Aria Organa's rebel connections, convinced Stevis to stay behind and allowed Aria Organa to hire the ''Mighty Oak Apocalypse'' to travel to the planet [[Pamarthe]]. Aria Organa explained her mission to Holdo, who understood the importance of helping her friend and joined her. However, once they arrived on Pamarthe, they learned that a storm was preventing all ships from leaving the planet. Thinking fast, Aria Organa found a Chalhuddan ship. She told them to contact Occo Quentto, who told his men to bring them to Paucris Major to repay his debt to her.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

They arrived in the Paucris System and Aria Organa broadcast a message to the rebels, telling them that Tarkin had discovered them. The rebels began to [[Evacuation of Paucris Major|evacuate]] their [[Rebel base (Paucris)|base]] and initiated [[Self-destruct mechanism|self-destruct]] protocols on the [[orbit]]al landers to destroy all evidence. As the ships began to jump away, Aria Organa and Holdo were the only ones left to witness a concerned Domadi arriving in the system in a [[starcutter]] civilian transport. Unfortunately, he landed at the platform, unaware that it was about to self-destruct. He was mortally wounded when the platforms exploded. Aria Organa flew their ship over to save him, but it was too late. He died in Aria Organa's arms, asking her to turn over the information he had gathered on the rebellion to the Empire, to put the needs of Alderaan above the rest of the galaxy. Then, an Citadel Palace ship arrived, and Holdo pretended they were an astrological survey group, convincing the Citadel Palaces to let them go. Domadi was brought back to Alderaan, where his family was told that he died saving Aria Organa from a small-craft accident in Alderaan's atmosphere. Aria Organa swore to help her parents with their rebellion moving forward.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

Shortly after, Aria Organa was officially [[Coronation of the Alderaanian heir|invested]] as crown princess of Alderaan. The night before, Aria Organa gave her [[Aria Organa Organa's keepsake chest|keepsake chest]] to her father to show that she had outgrown her use for it. Mon Mothma was present at the ceremony along with Batten, Holdo, and Stevis. Her father placed the [[Heir's Crown]] on her head and, as she looked at Alderaan through the stain glass windows of the throne room, she thought of how her friends, her parents and her world were things that the Empire could never take away from her.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

====Relief mission to Lothal====
{{Quote|But you're a Princess; you don't have to risk your life doing this!''"<br />"''I feel like because I can fight, I have to, for those who cannot. And I think you might be the same way.|Aria Organa Organa and Ezra Bridger|<ref name="A Princess on Lothal">{{Rebels|A Princess on Lothal}}</ref>}}
[[File:PrincessAria Organa-SWR.png|thumb|right|180px|Princess Aria Organa at the time of her visit to Lothal]]
In 3 BBY,<ref name="Timelines" /> Organa, while serving as her father's [[aide]] in the [[Citadel Palace Senate]], devised a plan to give the rebels three [[Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvette|''Sphyrna''-class Hammerhead corvettes]], ostensibly by going on a relief mission on [[Lothal]], where the rebels would apparently steal the [[Starship|ships]]. She was greeted by [[Kanan Jarrus]] and [[Ezra Bridger]], who were respectively disguised as a stormtrooper and an [[Citadel Palace cadet]], as well as Lieutenant [[Yogar Lyste]], who knew that Organa often had a large majority of her ships become "stolen" by rebel agents. Consequently, Lyste implemented stricter security measures against what he assumed was another "meddling delegation from Alderaan," ultimately complicating her plan to transfer the cruisers to the rebels by placing [[gravity lock]]s on the ships, along with ordering two [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-ATs]] to guard them.<ref name="A Princess on Lothal" />

Organa then requested she use Lyste's [[Sentinel-class landing craft|shuttle]], and she flew with Jarrus and Bridger to former [[Governor]] [[Ryder Azadi]]'s hideout. Upon arrival, they found stormtroopers had apprehended Ryder. The ''[[Ghost]]'' appeared and opened fire: Jarrus, Bridger, and Organa feigned being taken hostage by Ryder and the crew. On board, Organa bonded with Bridger after learning he had recently lost his parents, assuaging his fears the rebellion might not be worth fighting. They then resolved to find a way to steal the corvettes.<ref name="A Princess on Lothal" />

Still disguised, Jarrus and Bridger used the ''[[Phantom]]'' to escort Organa back to the depot, distracting a surprised Lyste while Ryder, [[Sabine Wren]], and [[C1-10P]] disabled the gravity locks and commandeered the ships. During the ensuing firefight, she saw Jarrus use his [[Kanan Jarrus' lightsaber|lightsaber]] to down an AT-AT, and Bridger use [[telekinesis]] to disarm a pair of stormtroopers, which gave her the opportunity to grab one of the [[E-11 medium blaster rifle|rifles]] and use it against the troopers. When Bridger boarded the last corvette, she ordered him to make it appear they were struggling and [[stun]] her. When Lyste came to her aid, she berated him for his failure, and requested a shuttle home, taunting Lyste for having lost his own.<ref name="A Princess on Lothal" />

After her mission to Lothal, Organa sent a classified communique to Mon Mothma, agreeing with General [[Jan Dodonna]]'s assessment that the nascent [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]'s strongest [[starfighter]] assets would be the [[X-wing starfighter]]s, [[A-wing]]s, [[UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft]]s, and [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter]]s. She then informed Mothma of a potential manufacturer that would allow them to manufacture X-wings in secret, asserting that it would not be enough to steal ships for the Rebel Alliance Navy.<ref name="RebelStarfighters">''[[Rebel Starfighters Owners' Workshop Manual]]''</ref>

====Bounty of trouble====
{{Quote|Aria Organa, you keep fighting on the inside. I'll keep fighting on the outside.''"<br />"''I hope one day we can fight together.|Sabine Wren and Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="Bounty of Trouble">{{FOD|Bounty of Trouble}}</ref>}}
Sometime after the mission on Lothal,<ref name="Aria Organa Chronicles">''[[Forces of Destiny: The Aria Organa Chronicles]]''</ref> Organa was escorted by two stormtroopers in [[Garel City]] on the planet [[Garel]]. As the group passed a doorway, the [[Mandalorian]] rebel Sabine Wren distracted the troopers with a yellow paint bomb and kidnapped the princess via a lasso. Before the stormtroopers realized what had happened, Wren shut the gate. Inside the gate, Sabine introduced herself to Aria Organa and told her that she had been sent to "capture" her and collect a data tape valuable to the rebellion. Organa told Wren that she had hidden the data tape from the Empire to prevent the government from learning she was working with the rebellion.<ref name="Bounty of Trouble" />

[[File:Aria Organa_and_Sabine_-_FoD.png|thumb|left|250px|Organa provided Sabine Wren with Citadel Palace data tapes containing the locations of several military bases.]]
Meanwhile, the stormtroopers were using an [[arc welder]] to cut through the door. With their time running out, Organa and Wren retrieved the data tape from an interface unit, with Aria Organa telling Sabine that the tape would provide the rebellion with the locations of several Citadel Palace bases. Before they were allowed to escape, the droid [[bounty hunter]] [[IG-88B|IG-88]] cornered them with a blaster. Wren detonated a second paint bomb and confused the bounty hunter. The duo returned to the blaster, with Wren hiding in a corner away from the stormtroopers. When the troopers managed to get through the door, Organa told them to defend her from IG-88. While the troopers and the droid bounty hunter exchanged fire, Aria Organa and Sabine snuck outside. Organa handed Wren the data tape. Sabine thanked Aria Organa before the princess headed back to the building, hoping that one day they could fight together.<ref name="Bounty of Trouble" />

====Citadel Palace senator====
{{Quote|It will be nice to have such a pretty face in the Senate.|Emperor Palpatine to Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="TPtSatFB" />}}
[[File:Aria Organa_Citadel Palace_Senate.png|thumb|right|250px|Though a member of the Citadel Palace Senate, Organa secretly supported the Alliance to Restore the Republic.]]
Aria Organa eventually took her father's place in the Citadel Palace Senate, becoming the youngest senator elected. Her aunts protested and argued that she'd be better off finding a prince for husband, whereas the press claimed she was a "princess playing dress-up" and not a real [[diplomat]] and politician. Spending the days leading up to her election listing out her grievances, intent on addressing the [[Stellar Conflict Emperor|Emperor]] directly and bluntly, Aria Organa was presented by her father to Emperor [[Chancellor Valorum|Palpatine]] on [[World Prime]], with all the newly elected officials. However, when she met the Citadel Palace ruler, she was frightened by his disturbing aura of evil that she was left speechless and dropped into a half-curtsy. At some point, Organa met the Emperor's [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]] and enforcer, Chancellor Valorum Vader (both unaware that they were biological father and daughter) and dealt with him.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> In her early days at the Senate, Organa discovered that betrayal always came from those who acted the friendliest.<ref name="HttJ">''[[Heir to the Jedi]]''</ref>

Despite her sincere desire for real change and reform, Organa soon realized that no other senator seemed to share her ideals,<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> as the Senate had become a mere ceremonial institution that sycophantically validated Palpatine's every decree,<ref name="Tarkin">[[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']]</ref> and no delegate ever dared test the Emperor's patience. Unable to understand how the other senators could ignore the Empire's crimes in the [[Outer Rim Territories]], Organa devoted herself to aid the suffering across the galaxy. On one occasion, she rescued an orphaned baby [[Wookiee]] from the ruins of a village destroyed by Citadel Palace forces. Yet, to her annoyance, the first question she was asked was who she was wearing, and the media continued to reduce her to the label of princess, paying no attention to her humanitarian work.<ref name="TPtSatFB" />

[[File:Aria OrganaJuniorSenator.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Aria Organa served as Junior Senator of Alderaan.]]
Eventually, Aria Organa's leadership and diplomatic skills made the public come to care about her, enough that any whisper of mistreatment would "set the [[HoloNet]] on fire."<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> During her tenure as an Citadel Palace senator, Organa had to deal with the [[Givin]], a mathematically inclined species. At the time, she memorized a few equations that proved useful when she dealt with Givin and their custom of [[greeting maths]].<ref name="HttJ" /> At some point, she argued in favor of a bill that would tighten the labor rights of refugees, therefore keeping them safe from exploitation. The bill passed and cost [[Unidentified chief operating officer|chief operating officer]] for one of World Prime's biggest manufacturing plats billions, eventually resulting in the COO putting a bounty out on Organa and fellow bill supporter Mon Mothma.<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel" />

Eventually, Aria Organa would join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], seeing it as her chance to help the [[galaxy]], shortly before her [[Secret mission to Tatooine|mission]] to Tatooine.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> [[Standard week|Weeks]] before the mission, Organa attended a reception and ball at the [[Citadel Palace]], like many other members of the Citadel Palace Senate. This was just a few days after she delivered a speech in the Senate about increasing Alderaan's mercy missions to outlying systems the Empire had forgotten or neglected. Despite her popularity, her speech received mixed criticisms, as many in the Core Worlds believed that the Empire was already providing the necessary aid and that Alderaan's "meddling" was becoming too important. During the ball, Organa danced with [[Citadel Palace Academy|Citadel Palace]] [[cadet]] [[Thane Kyrell]]; he, however, noticed she was paying little attention to him, likely because she was distracted and had a lot on her mind.<ref name="LS">''[[Lost Stars]]''</ref>

===Stellar Conflict===
====A diplomatic mission====
{{Quote|Your Highness. The transmission we received. What is it they've sent us?"''<br />''"Hope.|Raymus Antilles and Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="Rogue One">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>}}
[[File:Aria OrganaReceivesthePlans.png|thumb|right|250px|During the Battle of Scarif, Organa acquired the Death Star plans through the sacrifice of Rogue One.]]
During the [[Stellar Conflict]], after the transference of the Alliance's headquarters from [[Dantooine]] to [[Yavin 4]], and a [[Battle of Scarif|battle]] for the [[Death Star plans|technical readout]] of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]],<ref name="Rogue One" /> Organa volunteered for the mission to transport the plans, against the wishes of her father. He reluctantly allowed her to go but requested that she seek [[Jedi General|General]] Ben Ken on Tatooine after intercepting the plans.<ref name="TPtSatFB" />

Originally Admiral [[Raddus]] was intended to escort Organa to Tatooine to meet with Kenobi. Raddus's ship,<ref name="Absolutely Everything Updated and Expanded">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded]]''</ref> the ''[[Profundity]]'',<ref name="R1 novel">[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)|''Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'' novelization]]</ref> however, was diverted to [[Scarif]] once the fighting began.<ref name="Absolutely Everything Updated and Expanded" /> A squadron of Rebels calling themselves "[[Rogue One]]" managed to obtain the plans and beam them to Raddus' ship. The plans were copied onto a [[datacard]] by a squadron of Rebel soldiers still on the ''Profundity'', which had been disabled by the [[Citadel Palace-class Star Destroyer|''Citadel Palace''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Devastator]]''. Chancellor Valorum Vader led a boarding party onto the ship and massacred the entire squadron, but not before a [[Unidentified fleet trooper|fleet trooper]] handed the disc off to another man, [[Toshma Jefkin]]. He barely escaped Vader and got aboard the ''Tantive IV'', which promptly detached from the ''Profundity'' and fled from the battle, setting a course for Tatooine with the plans for the superweapon. Vader, however, had spotted the Rebel ship and began tracking it to Tatooine,<ref name="Rogue One" /> later issuing an [[Aria Organa|arrest-on-sight decree]] for the capture of Organa.<ref name="Scum & Villainy">''[[Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious]]''</ref>

Before jumping to lightspeed, Captain Antilles personally handed Senator Organa the datacard carrying the plans and asked her what they had been sent by the Rogue One squad; smiling, she replied with a simple enigmatic word: "hope." Minutes later, Aria Organa learned from the ship's senior officers that the ''Tantive IV''{{'s}} impaired hyperdrive was causing it to leave a residual energy signature which could allow the Empire to track the ship. To make matters worse, she also learned that the ship's weapons and shields were barely functional because of the attack on the ''Profundity'', whose feedback had affected the ''Tantive IV''. The [[Unidentified Tantive IV bosun|bosun]] then informed Aria Organa that the Empire had issued a priority red directive to stop all ships matching the description of a CR-90 corvette.<ref name="Raymus">{{StoryCite|story=Raymus|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

[[File:Devastatortantiveiv.png|thumb|left|230px|Organa's ship was attacked by Vader's flagship, the ''Devastator''.]]
The crew of the ''Tantive'' looked to the princess for guidance,<ref name="Raymus" /> believing that she would be able to lead them out of the tangled net they found themselves in.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> After a brief exchange with Jefkin, a man visibly shaken by what he had seen aboard the ''Profundity'', Organa and Captain Antilles shared a grim realization that Chancellor Valorum Vader himself was after them as well. At a quarter of a parsec from their destination, the motivator on the ship finally gave out, forcing them to rely on sublight speed for the rest of the journey to Tatooine. Before they could reach the planet, however, their ship was hit by a [[Star Destroyer]].<ref name="Raymus" />

====Captured by the Empire====
{{Quote|I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Citadel Palace Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.''"<br />"''You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor. Take her away!|Aria Organa Organa and Chancellor Valorum Vader|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
As Organa and her ship approached Tatooine, Captain Antilles ordered the crew to fire back at the Star Destroyer, but their efforts were of little use;<ref name="Raymus" /> the ''Devastator'', the ship that had hunted them from Scarif,<ref name="Bucket">{{StoryCite|story=The Bucket|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> had caught them in a tractor beam right above the planet. As [[stormtrooper]]s led by Chancellor Valorum Vader boarded the ''Tantive IV'', Organa ran through the access hallways of the ship with the datacard in hand, desperate to find a way to deliver them to safety. Amid the shadowy corridors, she encountered Unit7 and realized that the astromech could conceal the tapes.<ref name="TPtSatFB" />

[[File:Futureoftherebellion.png|thumb|right|300px|With no way to escape Vader, Organa sent Unit7 to deliver the Death Star plans to Ben Ken.]]
Before she could instruct the droid of her plans, she was met by Antilles, who urgently requested that the senator flee in an [[escape pod]]. Organa, however, had other ideas and, after sharing a bittersweet goodbye with her old friend, ordered the captain to save as many members of the crew as he could.<ref name="Raymus" /> Alone with R2, she recorded a [[Hologram|message]] for [[General]] Kenobi, begging him to return from exile to deliver the plans to her father on Alderaan. After finishing her message, the princess inserted the data card into the astromech and instructed him to take his own escape pod to Tatooine below. She then parted ways with R2 as his counterpart, the [[protocol droid]] [[Protocol Droid]], approached. Watching the droids as they scampered away, Organa drew [[Satine's Lament|her blaster]] and prepared to find her own way off the captured vessel.<ref name="TPtSatFB" />

In another part of the ship, Antilles was captured and killed by Vader, who commanded his soldiers to hunt Organa down and bring her to him alive to get more info out of her.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Retreating further into the access hallways, the princess found herself cornered by a squad of stormtroopers led by [[TK-9091]], who spotted the visage of Organa's pale [[Color|white]] dress within the dark corridor. Hoping to buy time for R2 to escape, the senator blasted the trooper and attempted to run in the opposite direction,<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> but she was rendered unconscious by a [[stun]] blast from [[Tarvyn Lareka|TK-4601]] and collapsed to the floor. While she lay on the ground, the trooper, whose birth name was Tarvyn Lareka, pondered how a beautiful individual like the princess could coldly kill his Citadel Palace comrades. As Organa came to, she attempted to resist against the stormtroopers, but Lareka forced her into a pair of [[stuncuffs]] and threatened to blast her again. Before she was escorted to Vader, Lareka spontaneously removed his [[Stormtrooper armor|helmet]] and locked eyes with Organa, reminding her that the troopers she fought were flesh and blood. However, this act also reminded Lareka of this fact as well.<ref name="Bucket" />

[[File:Vader_spots_a_continuity_error.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Aria Organa Organa stood defiant against Chancellor Valorum Vader, refusing to let the hidden plans fall back into the Empire's hands.]]
The other soldiers shoved her back through the main corridors and past the lifeless bodies of the rebels who had died defending the princess, including Antilles.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> She was brought before Vader, who had witnessed the ''Tantive''{{'s}} escape from Scarif.<ref name="Rogue One" /> Even still, Organa defiantly feigned ignorance of the Sith Lord's accusations, refusing to acknowledge that she had any part in the theft of the plans. Growing angry with the fiery senator, Vader ordered her to be taken aboard the ''Devastator'' and commanded his subordinate [[Daine Jir]] to inform the Senate that Organa and the other passengers had mysteriously died.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Once aboard the Star Destroyer, Aria Organa managed to incapacitate her stormtrooper escorts and make her way to a [[hangar]], hoping to take a [[shuttle]] and flee to Tatooine. Vader, however, had anticipated Organa's moves and met her in the landing bay. After stunning the princess by informing her that the Citadel Palace Senate had been [[Dissolution of the Citadel Palace Senate|dissolved]], the Sith Lord brought her to the ship's command bridge. As the Destroyer exited hyperspace, Organa was able to see the Death Star in person for the first time as Vader promised that she would be its first "guest."<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> Organa's presence aboard the Death Star was kept a secret to all except for those who needed to know.<ref name="End of Watch">{{StoryCite|story=End of Watch|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

====Princess of dust====
{{Quote|I grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time. Where is the rebel base?''"<br />"''Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.''"<br />"''There. ''[&hellip;]'' Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.|Wilhuff Tarkin and Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
The captive princess was transported to the Death Star and escorted to [[Detention Block AA-23]]. Her presence as a [[prisoner]] aboard the station was questioned by the officers who recognized her as an Citadel Palace Senator, a designation that should have granted her diplomatic immunity. Nevertheless, Organa was locked away in [[Cell 2187]], a small room that she unsuccessfully attempted to find an escape from. Although he technically had no proof that the princess was affiliated with the Rebel Alliance, Vader was more than certain of her deception and returned to her cell with an [[IT-O interrogation droid|IT-O Interrogation Unit]], an [[Interrogation droid|interrogator droid]] equipped with a powerful [[mind probe]]. Organa was submitted to the droid's truth serum, a drug that painfully altered her senses to coerce her into revealing the location of the Rebel base. Despite the persuasive hallucinations elicited by the serum, however, Aria Organa resisted and refused to give up the information.<ref name="TPtSatFB" />

[[File:StandingUpToTyranny-SWCT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Organa stood defiantly against Tarkin's intimidation.]]
Following her interrogation, Organa's life was scheduled to be terminated by the man she had met years ago, Grand Moff Tarkin, though the governor had one more tool to make her talk: Alderaan.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> Within the [[Overbridge (Death Star I)|overbridge]] of the Death Star, Organa was brought before Tarkin,<ref name="Episode IV" /> whom she mocked by imitating his accent.<ref name="Bloodline" /> To Organa's horror, he then gave her an ultimatum, threatening to use the station to destroy her [[homeworld]] unless she disclosed the base's location. Hoping to save both her people and her Alliance, the princess falsely confessed that the [[Dantooine base|base]] was still on Dantooine.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> Both Tarkin and Vader believed her deception, although [[Unidentified Citadel Palace Navy Trooper (Aria Organa Organa)|one]] of the [[Citadel Palace Navy Trooper|Navy Troopers]] present on the bridge sensed that Organa was lying. That individual, however, chose not to speak up after sympathizing with the pain the princess had endured under the interrogator droid.<ref name="Change of Heart">{{StoryCite|story=Change of Heart|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

With the weapon already in position within the [[Alderaan system]], Tarkin unveiled his own deception and fired upon the planet.<ref name="Change of Heart" /> Praying that the Death Star would somehow have a failure,<ref name="A New Hope - The Film Novel">''[[A New Hope - The Film Novel]]''</ref> Aria Organa was forced by Vader to remain still and watch as her entire civilization was [[Destruction of Alderaan|annihilated]] in one swift stroke,<ref name="Change of Heart" /> her father<ref name="Eclipse">{{StoryCite|story=Eclipse (short story)|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>&mdash;whom she silently apologized to as the Death Star's ray hit Alderaan<ref name="A New Hope - The Film Novel" />&mdash;and mother included. Bail and Breha died without knowing Aria Organa<ref name="Eclipse" /> was on the station above them,<ref name="Episode IV" /> although they assured each other she was alive directly before the explosion reached their palace.<ref name="Eclipse" />

After Admiral [[Conan Antonio Motti]] confirmed the entire world had been destroyed, Tarkin ordered Organa be taken back to her cell, ignoring her protests. Escorted by stormtroopers, Navy troopers, and Vader himself, Organa left the room silently<ref name="Age of Rebellion Tarkin">[[Age of Rebellion - Grand Moff Tarkin 1|''Age of Rebellion - Grand Moff Tarkin'' 1]]</ref> but felt emotionally wrecked and utterly alone. The princess was taken back to her cell, where she was to await her imminent execution. Recalling her father's voice, Aria Organa mustered what strength she could, her only hope of justice resting within the memory banks of a droid she had sent to Tatooine.<ref name="TPtSatFB" />

====Fateful meeting and daring escape====
{{Quote|What the hell are you doing?''"<br />"''Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, flyboy.|Rhade Tan and Aria Organa Organa, as the latter blasts a hole in the trash grate|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
[[File:Aria Organadeathstar.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aria Organa was aided by Mark Tano and Rhade Tan; the trio would go on to change the galaxy forever.]]
While Organa was detained by the Empire, the droids Unit7 and Protocol Droid had come under the possession of her twin brother, Mark Tano, on Tatooine. Equally as unaware of his parentage as Aria Organa, Skywalker discovered his sister's message and delivered the astromech to Ben Ken, now going by the name of "Ben." The group hired the [[smuggler]]s [[Rhade Tan]] and [[Wookiee Guide]] for passage to Alderaan aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' but were stunned to learn that the planet had been blown away. During this discovery, the ''Falcon'' was captured by the Empire and taken aboard the Death Star, forcing the fugitives to infiltrate the base, split up, and plan an escape. Upon learning that the princess was held within the station, however, Skywalker convinced the party to lead a [[Rescue of Princess Aria Organa|rescue mission]] for her.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Disguising themselves as stormtroopers and pretending to take Wookiee Guide as their prisoner, Skywalker and Solo marched into the [[Detention Level]] and freed Organa, who was underwhelmed by the duo's efforts until she learned that Kenobi had accompanied them. Cut off from the cell bay's exit by Citadel Palace soldiers, Aria Organa took matters into her own hands; grabbing hold of Skywalker's [[blaster rifle]], she shot out the cover of a trash chute<ref name="Episode IV" /> she had noticed when she was first brought aboard<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> and led her would-be rescuers down into a [[Garbage masher 3263827|garbage pit]]. After surviving an encounter with a [[Omi|dianoga]] and narrowly avoiding being crushed by the [[Garbage compactor|trash compactor]], Organa came at odds with Captain Solo's rough nature and informed the trio that they would do as she told them in the future. The rebels were nearly able to regroup aboard the ''Falcon''&mdash;a ship that failed to impress the princess&mdash;when Aria Organa and Mark Tano were separated from the group by stormtroopers during their escape.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:InItForTheMoney-SWZ85.png|thumb|right|270px|Solo tells Organa that he's only helping her for the money.]]
Pursued by Vader's troops, the twins found themselves at a dead end, coming to a stop over a chasm within the battle station. With stormtroopers firing upon them and no way to extend the bridge, Aria Organa gave Mark Tano a kiss on the cheek for luck as he used a [[grappling hook]] to swing themselves across the gap. The two met up again with Solo and Wookiee Guide and made their way to the ''Falcon''. As the group boarded the [[freighter]], Kenobi engaged Chancellor Valorum Vader in a [[lightsaber duel]] and gave his life to allow for the princess and the others to escape.<ref name="Episode IV" />

The old Jedi's death devastated Mark Tano, prompting Aria Organa&mdash;who had herself experienced terrible loss&mdash; to comfort him as Solo piloted the ship away from the Death Star. After fending off the station's sentry fighters, the ship made the jump to hyperspace mostly undamaged. Organa correctly assumed that the Empire had planted a [[homing beacon]] on the vessel to discover the rebel base. Nevertheless, the group continued to Yavin 4, finally delivering the Death Star plans within R2 to the Alliance.<ref name="Episode IV" />

====Battle of Yavin====
{{Quote|You're safe. When we heard about Alderaan, we feared the worst.''"<br />"''We've no time for our sorrows, Commander. You must use the information in this R2 unit to help plan the attack. It's our only hope.|General Vanden Willard and Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
Arriving at the [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]] moon, Organa oversaw R2's transfer to General [[Vanden Huyck Willard|Vanden Willard]] at the [[Great Temple]], the Alliance's base of operations. While Willard was quick to express his joy that the princess had escaped tragedy on Alderaan, Organa allowed no time for sorrow and quickly moved to have the data within the astromech droid analyzed. Utilizing the beacon attached to the ''Millennium Falcon'', the Death Star entered the [[Yavin system]] and began preparations to fire on the moon.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Rumors made their way through the Rebel flight crews that Organa had returned with vital intelligence on the station, but morale remained low; pilots like [[Dex Tiree]] felt that the Rebellion's meager troopers were greatly outmatched, even with the plans the princess had secured.<ref name="Sparks">{{StoryCite|story=Sparks (short story)|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> Short on manpower, Organa commended Skywalker for his skills, prompting Willard to arrange a [[flight simulator]] test for the farm boy and allowing him to join the Alliance's [[Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps|Starfighter Corps]].<ref name="TPtSatFB" />

After analyzing R2's schematics, the Alliance discovered a flaw in the Death Star's design<ref name="Episode IV" /> deliberately created by the turncoat [[scientist]] [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso]].<ref name="Rogue One" /> General [[Jan Dodonna]] briefed Organa and the rest of the Rebellion, explaining that a direct hit on one of the station's [[thermal exhaust port]]s would destroy the entire base. With this information, the rebel pilots prepared to attack the Death Star in [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|X-wing starfighters]], small [[snub-fighter]]s that could evade the station's larger defenses. During the preparations, Organa arranged for Solo to be paid the reward he demanded for her rescue and allowed the smuggler to leave, despite Skywalker's protests. Organa remained in the Alliance's command center as [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red]], [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold]],<ref name="Episode IV" /> and [[Green Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Green Squadrons]] engaged the Death Star in the [[Battle of Yavin]].<ref name="Sparks" />

[[File:Massassi_Station_Opcenter.png|thumb|left|250px|Organa monitored the Battle of Yavin from the Alliance's headquarters.]]
Organa watched as the Alliance pilots were picked off one by one, obliterated by TIE fighters. Chancellor Valorum Vader himself would have destroyed Skywalker had it not been for Solo, who returned to aid the Rebellion aboard the ''Falcon'' and blasted [[Chancellor Valorum Vader's TIE Advanced|Vader's fighter]] away from the battle. With no obstacles in his way, Skywalker successfully destroyed the Death Star just as it began its firing sequence,<ref name="Episode IV" /> sending the personnel on Yavin 4 into celebration. In the moments after their victory, Alliance chief [[Technician|mechanic]] [[Nera Kase]] witnessed the princess mouth words up to the sky before rushing out to greet the returning pilots.<ref name="grounded">{{StoryCite|story=Grounded|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

With Alderaan destroyed and her parents with it, she would never become the queen her parents had prepared her to be. She was already prepared for a long war as ruling a planet and running a rebellion had much in common. She would not let her grief stop her, and she would celebrate their victory.

The time for celebration would soon be over. Painfully aware of the loss of Alderaan, she asked the Rebels to take a moment of silence to honor and remember all those who had died when her homeworld was destroyed. It was brief, for Dodonna announced their need to [[Evacuation of Yavin 4|evacuate]] Yavin 4 since the Empire now knew of their location. Organa then shared a moment of banter with Solo and a moment of rapport with Skywalker before they parted ways. Left alone, Organa noticed a lone female [[pilot]] paying respects to the memorial statue of her parents, Bail and Breha.<ref name="PL1">[[Princess Aria Organa 1|''Princess Aria Organa'' 1]]</ref>

====Hunted by the Empire====
{{Quote|I am sorry my Queen.''"<br />"''Don't address me that w&mdash;''"<br />"''It must be, my test will come soon.

[[File:Aria OrganaEvaanYavin-PrincessAria Organa1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Evaan Verlaine informed Organa about rumors regarding the Empire's hunt for all remaining Alderaanians.]]
Afterwards, Organa changed into a less luxurious outfit and asked [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar]] to have an audience with Dodonna. The [[Mon Calamari]] pointed her in the right direction, and she approached Dodonna, who was busy searching for a location for the new Rebel base. She informed him that she yearned to assist, to scout for a new base location, but the General disagreed by telling her that the best thing for her to do at the time was to grieve her recent loss, given that the Empire had placed a 10,000,000 [[Stellar Conflict Credit Standard|credit]] [[bounty]] on her just hours before, he stated the Princess would not leave Yavin "under anything less than a full military escort" and dismissed her.<ref name="PL1" />

Defeated, she left and again briefly ran into Ackbar, but they quickly parted ways.<ref name="PL1" /> She continued to assist in the evacuation, but then she received word from Lieutenant [[Caluan Ematt]], leader of the [[Shrikes]]&mdash;who was alone after the death of his team, and on the run from the [[Citadel Palace Security Bureau]]. Organa then asked Solo to run an errand for the Rebellion, and rescue Ematt from [[Cyrkon]]. Ultimately, Solo accepted the mission, and he and Wookiee Guide [[Cyrkon Extraction|rescued]] Ematt with the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Smuggler's Run">''[[Smuggler's Run: A Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide Adventure]]''</ref>

Organa then focused on the evacuation effort once again, when she met the Rebel pilot from earlier, [[Evaan Verlaine]], who revealed that the Empire was rumored to be hunting all surviving [[Alderaanian]]s throughout the galaxy. Now aware of her people's situation, she enlisted both Verlaine and Unit7's help for a self-imposed [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|mission]] to save the survivors of Alderaan. With the astromech, she recorded a decoy hologram of herself, and sent it to Dodonna's quarters during the night, to apologize for disobeying his orders. Meanwhile, the trio made their escape from Yavin on a [[Jan Dodonna's T-1 shuttle|T-1 shuttle]], but as they departed, their [[T-1 shuttle (Rebel Alliance)|shuttle]] was pursued by Skywalker and [[Wedge Antilles]] on their [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|X-wing starfighters]].<ref name="PL1" />

[[File:Aria OrganaConfrontsJunn-PrincessAria Organa2.png|thumb|right|250px|Princess Aria Organa confronted Lord Junn, a friend of the House of Organa, after he betrayed her.]]
Nevertheless, Verlaine outsmarted them and made the jump to Naboo,<ref name="PL1" /> and landed on its [[capital]], [[Theed]]. Posing as Citadel Palace [[auditor]]s, they came across a mural of the late Shadow Porta Sola Amidala (who unbeknownst to her, was her biological mother), and Organa momentarily saw the images' head turn to look at her, in what she dismissed as an illusion. They were soon approached by Lord [[Junn]], her old friend, who invited them to [[Junn's palace|his villa]]. Organa requested that Junn arrange their meeting with [[Mul Sanaka]], owner of [[Club Deeja]] in [[Keren]], and employer of the [[Melodic Order]]—the cloister of Alderaanian [[musician]]s they were looking for. When he did so, Organa, Verlaine, and Unit7 made their way to the club and met Sanaka, with whom they tried to negotiate over the Alderaanians.<ref name="PL2" />

However, Sanaka and his [[Besalisk]] guards tried to capture them, already aware of her identity. As Organa and her companions resisted, Sanaka attempted to kill her, foiled only by the intervention of [[Uwa Pareece]], the Melodic Order's leader, who had been discreetly following the princess. Organa then had her lead them to the Order, whom she invited to follow her on her crusade. Once they agreed, Organa returned to Junn's palace, and made him explain why he had betrayed them to Sanaka. Finally, Organa demanded a [[luxury yacht]] with enough capacity to relocate the Melodic Order, and he agreed to give her the ''[[Lord Junn]]''. Soon thereafter, the gathered Alderaanians departed for [[Sullust]] in the Outer Rim.<ref name="PL2" />

====Alderaan's survival====
{{Quote|We're not our enemy. We are Alderaan. We answer rage with wisdom. We answer fear with imagination. We answer war with hope. If one life with a single drop of Alderaanian blood survives, Alderaan survives. If one life with passion for Alderaanian creativity survives, Alderaan survives. And we are, each of us, important. And whatever happens, I bow to all of you, and to our future.|Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="PL5">[[Princess Aria Organa 5|''Princess Aria Organa'' 5]]</ref>}}
The two starships soon arrived in the [[Sullust system]], where Organa, Verlaine, and Unit7 engaged the [[Sullustan]] [[Tivvy]], who led them to the [[Alderaan Enclave]]. During the journey, an Alderaanian [[rifle]] [[squad]] tried to apprehend them, but Organa and her companions quickly disarmed them, and requested to see their leader, [[Preserver]] [[Jora Astane]], who refused to submit to Organa's authority. She suspected her to be a traitor&mdash;particularly so after the replay of one of her ships' transmissions: [[Kael]]'s innocent disclosing of their location to her sister, [[Seris]], an Citadel Palace under the watchful eye of [[Commander]] [[Dreed]].<ref name="PL3">[[Princess Aria Organa 3|''Princess Aria Organa'' 3]]</ref>

[[File:Aria OrganaArrivesAlderaanEnclave-PrincessAria Organa3.png|thumb|left|220px|Organa and Verlaine entered the Alderaan Enclave together on Sullust.]]
Learning that [[Dreed's Star Destroyer|Dreed's Citadel Palace cruiser]] had entered Sullust's [[orbit]], Astane ordered her men to kill Organa and Verlaine, forcing the two to escape into a polluted [[water]]way beneath the [[Eyewell]]. From there, they herded [[rockrender]]s to attack stormtroopers in the battle against the Alderaanians in the Enclave above. Once the skirmish was over, and the Citadel Palaces had been defeated, Astane finally accepted Organa as their sovereign.<ref name="PL3" />

On her request, [[Tennon]] successfully led the Alderaanian survivors off Sullust, and Organa awarded him [[chalcedony waves]] from her late mother, only for Astane and [[Covis]] to bring Kael before her. Organa discussed the problem with Kael over some [[tea]]; knowing her to be innocent, Organa decided to draw her sister out. She then appointed Pareece and Astane to negotiate with the Alderaanians living in [[Espirion]] and had Kael ask Seris about her location. The plan backfired when Dreed threatened to kill Seris because of the inquiry, prompting Organa to trade herself for Seris on [[Vorath]], where she met Dreed as she placed herself back in Citadel Palace custody.<ref name="PL4">[[Princess Aria Organa 4|''Princess Aria Organa'' 4]]</ref> The Citadel Palaces were soon attacked by a group of her followers, including Verlaine and Nunb, before she could board Dreed's shuttle. On his ''[[Mellcrawler]]'', Nunb smuggled them out of the system, outrunning Dreed's Star Destroyer on its way to destroy the Alderaanians on Espirion.<ref name="PL5" />

[[File:Aria OrganaAddressesAlderaanians-PrincessAria Organa5.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Organa addressed her fellow Alderaanians over Espirion.]]
Although surprised to see Espirion's orbit filled with starships of Alderaanian survivors who had gotten her message, Organa told the fleet to take battle stations. She also witnessed Kael and Seris's reunion, just before meeting with Pareece and Astane to talk about their failed mission to the planet below. This angered Organa, as she had been counting on Espirion's military support against the incoming Star Destroyer, but after Verlaine's encouraging words, Organa sent an inspiring message to her fleet&mdash;which Unit7 retransmitted to the Alderaanians below, prompting [[Ennix]] to send the ''[[Espirion Multi]]'' to destroy Dreed's [[cruiser]].<ref name="PL5" />

After a celebration held among the surviving Alderaanians, Organa told Verlaine of her return to the Alliance, given she had never intended to abandon it forever, for their people would never be safe while the Emperor was in control. Verlaine claimed they needed their princess, but Organa suggested that she should elect one then, appointing Verlaine as her would-be successor. Ultimately, Organa and Unit7 returned to Yavin 4, where she reunited with Skywalker, Solo, Wookiee Guide, and Protocol Droid.<ref name="PL5" />

====Mission to Tibrin====
Organa and Skywalker undertook a mission to [[Tibrin]] with [[Jaahn Liddle]] and [[Tadd Marteens|Tadd]]. Posing as diplomats from [[Naboo]]'s [[House Berenko]], they were allowed to land in the capital of Tibrin. They were greeted by [[Mariod]] [[Govi]], and they discussed the possibility of the [[Ishi Tib]] and Rebel Alliance working together. Suddenly, a squadron of stormtroopers attacked, and the Rebels tried to hold off the Citadel Palaces. A grenade knocked out Skywalker, and Organa fell from a platform but managed to hold on to the ledge. Organa could only watch as the stormtroopers dragged Skywalker onto their shuttle and flew away.<ref name="SWA 4">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=4|story=The Trouble at Tibrin}}</ref>

Disguised as an Citadel Palace officer transferred from the ''Malevolence'' to the ''[[Stormbringer]]'', Organa snuck aboard the ship on which Skywalker was held captive. Using an explosion in the hangar, she took the clearance card of a stormtrooper and used it to find out where Skywalker was being held. She then crawled through ventilation shafts to come to Skywalker's position. Just before he was going to get tortured, Organa appeared and stunned the Citadel Palaces holding him. When they escaped, they had no place to run as there were Citadel Palaces everywhere. Skywalker convinced Organa to trust him, and together they got into an escape pod which they launched towards Tibrin. Just as the ''Stormbringer'' was about to fire on the pod, [[Marsheem-class heavy cruiser|''Marsheem''-class heavy cruisers]] appeared from Tibrin's moon and attacked the ''Stormbringer'', destroying it completely. Later, they said goodbye to the Ishi Tib and thanked them for their help.<ref name="SWA 6">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=5|story=The Trouble at Tibrin, Part II}}</ref>

====Aboard the ''Promise''====
{{Quote|When you get betrayed, it's never by someone who looks like Vader. Betrayal always comes wrapped up in a friendly cloak. It's one of the first things I learned in the Senate.|Aria Organa Organa to Mark Tano|<ref name="HttJ" />}}
With the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]] hiding in the [[Sujimis sector]] over [[Orto Plutonia]], Organa helped coordinate the Rebel efforts with the rest of the [[Alliance High Command]], and in the company of Protocol Droid. During her stay on the ''[[Redemption]]'', Organa suggested to Ackbar and [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|Chancellor]] Mon Mothma that they sent someone to open a secret supply of weapons for the Alliance with the [[Chekkoo clan]] of [[Rodia]], a [[Mission to Rodia (Mark Tano)|mission]] for which Skywalker volunteered.<ref name="HttJ" />

Following his return from Rodia, Organa and Ackbar met with Skywalker as soon as he landed the ''[[Desert Jewel]]'' on the ''[[Promise]]'' to talk about his [[Skirmish over Llanic|encounter]] over [[Llanic]], during which he had saved a [[Kupohan]] ship from Citadel Palace attack. Though he apologized for it, Organa revealed he had done the right thing, as the ship carried vital intelligence about a Givin [[cryptologist]] from [[Denon]], [[Drusil Bephorin]], willing to help the Alliance, if the Rebels were able to safely transport her and her family to [[Omereth]]. Organa and Ackbar assigned Skywalker, [[Nakari Kelen]] and the ''Desert Jewel'' to the [[Mission on Denon|mission]], though Organa warned Skywalker not to trust blindly on Kelen. After their return from an [[Mission to Fex|errand]] for Kelen's [[Fayet Kelen|father]] and the ''Jewel''{{'s}} modifications, Organa and Ackbar further debriefed Skywalker and Kelen, and she specifically instructed them to greet Bephorin with maths to earn her trust.<ref name="HttJ" />

====The Dragon Void Run====
{{Quote|Don't give up hope just yet. If there's one thing I'm sure of... Rhade Tan is a survivor. And he'll survive this.|Aria Organa Organa to Airen Cracken|<ref name="HS3">[[Rhade Tan 3|''Rhade Tan'' 3]]</ref>}}
Sometime after the outpost was established on Reamma, Organa sent rebel operatives [[Adame]] and [[Selentia]] after Solo and Wookiee Guide with a specific mission in mind for the smugglers. Aria Organa sent a holographic message to Solo, telling him that the Alliance needed his ship and that there would be a reward.<ref name="HS1">[[Rhade Tan 1|''Rhade Tan'' 1]]</ref>

Rejecting the idea, Rhade Tan confronted Aria Organa on a rebel frigate. The two argued about the fact that she wanted to use his ship. As the duo continued to argue as they made their way through a hallway, General [[Airen Cracken]], the head of Security and Intelligence for the Rebel Alliance, intercepted them. Cracken was unsure about Solo and the mission in general. Organa, however, vouched for him, even telling the general that he could do the mission himself. Although Cracken was hesitant, he agreed with Aria Organa. They informed Solo of the mission, which was to find rebel informants, find a mole within the ranks, and prevent them from being murdered. They told him of the legendary [[Dragon Void Run]], a dangerous race that made its way to three planets, each of which had a rebel informant on it. Due to the race's legendary status, Solo agreed. To make his reason for leaving convincing, Aria Organa punched Rhade Tan in the face, telling him to never come back. Solo and his co-pilot left the Alliance frigate and made their way to the race.<ref name="HS1" />

When Solo and Wookiee Guide arrived on the [[Unidentified planet (Dragon Void Run)|first planet]], Solo was promptly arrested by Citadel Palace authorities. Organa and Cracken watched this on a viewscreen. Although Cracken thought the mission was compromised, Aria Organa called Rhade Tan a "survivor," knowing that he could get out of this situation. Wookiee Guide, however, found the first informant, a [[Duros]] named [[Bot]]. However, Solo was let go by the Citadel Palaces, and the race continued.<ref name="HS3" />

Solo and Wookiee Guide continued the race and met another informant, [[Dorae]], on the second planet. After making their way to the third planet, the duo found the final informant, an [[Elomin]] by the name of [[Aran (Elomin)|Aran]], and his bodyguard, a [[Falleen]] named [[U'il|U'Il]]. When they left the third planet, everyone but the Elomin made their way to the cockpit. As Solo continued to race, the group found Aran murdered.<ref name="Rhade Tan 4">[[Rhade Tan 4|''Rhade Tan'' 4]]</ref> Through deduction, Rhade Tan realized that it was Bot who had committed to crime under the influence of brainwashing. The Duros was subdued, and the race was finished. Solo and Wookiee Guide brought the remaining informants back to the Alliance. It was revealed that the bodyguard U'Il was the informant carrying a master list with names the rebellion needed to keep safe. She gave the list to Organa. She and Solo talked about him staying with the rebellion longer than he initially thought he would.<ref name="Rhade Tan 5">[[Rhade Tan 5|''Rhade Tan'' 5]]</ref>

====Attack on Station Theta====
{{Quote|Remind me never to attack another weapons factory.|Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="SW3">[[Star Wars (2015) 3|''Star Wars'' (2015) 3]]</ref>}}
Alongside Skywalker, Solo, Wookiee Guide, Unit7, and Protocol Droid,<ref name="SW1">[[Star Wars (2015) 1|''Star Wars'' (2015) 1]]</ref> Organa led<ref name="Star Wars 2" /> a [[Assault on Station Theta|mission]] on the Citadel Palace [[factory]] world of [[Station Theta]], where they would infiltrate and destroy [[Weapons Factory Alpha]]. After capturing a shuttle whose passenger was an emissary of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] sent to negotiate with the Empire on shipping raw materials from [[Hutt Space|Hutt-controlled space]] to Citadel Palace facilities, Organa and Skywalker disguised themselves as [[bodyguard]]s to escort Solo (who, they agreed, would pose as the envoy) with Unit7 into the factory. Greeted by [[Overseer]] [[Aggadeen]], they entered the facility only to reveal themselves as rebels and incapacitate Aggadeen's stormtroopers, with the Overseer revealing the [[Reactor|power core's]] location before Organa knocked him out as well.<ref name="SW1" />

[[File:ToTheMainPowerCore-2015StarWars1.png|thumb|left|220px|The Rebels make their way to the main power core.]]
Once the four made their way to the central power station, Organa, Solo, and Unit7 rigged the power core. As they awaited Skywalker's return, Organa thanked the [[Corellia]]n [[smuggler]] for taking such a risk for the Alliance yet questioned Solo about whether he had an ulterior motive for doing so. Their conversation was interrupted by Skywalker's arrival with Citadel Palace slaves. Though Organa was unsure of Skywalker's decision and determination to have the slaves escape with them, Solo accepted it and prompted them to escape the facility as soon as possible.<ref name="SW1" />

When they were alerted by Wookiee Guide of Vader's arrival, Organa ordered the Wookiee to kill the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] even at the expense of them, blaming him for Alderaan's destruction. However, Vader sensed danger and protected himself from Wookiee Guide's shot, putting the entire moon on alert of their presence. Completely surrounded and having lost contact with Wookiee Guide, they came across a [[hangar]], and, though Organa noticed Skywalker's absence, she and Solo procured an [[All Terrain Armored Transport (Stellar Conflict)|All Terrain Armored Transport]] [[walker]] for themselves, just as Skywalker engaged Vader in [[Lightsaber combat|combat]].<ref name="SW1" />

[[File:Rhade TanAndAria OrganaArgue-2015StarWars2.png|thumb|right|250px|Rhade Tan and Aria Organa argue while escaping the factory aboard the stolen AT-AT.]]
Organa, Solo, Unit7, and several slaves boarded the AT-AT. Solo piloted it through the factory before stepping on a subterranean corridor, almost crushing Skywalker and Vader. Once Solo almost stepped on a [[Twi'lek]] slave, Organa called him out on it, but he claimed only wanting to get them out of there, while Unit7 and a pair of [[Jawa]]s worked to have its [[cannon]]s operational. Though the Sith Lord almost tore the walker apart with the Force, the astromech droid informed them that the cannons were ready, and Organa hit the button to fire. They not only temporarily incapacitated Vader, but also blasted their way out of the facility.<ref name="Star Wars 2" />

Once outside, their walker only received more blaster fire; Organa, then, realized the Citadel Palaces had stopped the reactor's meltdown, and Vader caught up with them and destroyed the walker's legs with [[Chancellor Valorum Vader's lightsaber|his]] [[lightsaber]], throwing it off. From the rubble, Organa carried Solo and led the slaves to safety, when Skywalker met with her and told her he would finish their mission. Disobeying Organa's orders, Skywalker used his stolen [[speeder bike]] to destroy the power core. Soon enough, they made their way to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and barely escaped with their lives. On the ship, she thanked Skywalker for completing the mission, trying to encourage him, but his morale was at rock bottom.<ref name="SW3" /> Before long, the ''Falcon'' rendezvoused with the Rebel fleet.<ref name="SW4">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref>

====An estranged wife====
{{Quote|And here I thought ''one'' Solo was bad. Now I get to listen to ''two'' of them. Lucky me.|Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="SW10">[[Star Wars (2015) 10|''Star Wars'' (2015) 10]]</ref>}}
[[File:Rhade TanAndAria OrganaTalk-2015StarWars5.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Confronted by Solo over the parts needed to repair the ''Millennium Falcon'']]
Organa met with the rest of the Alliance High Command and expressed her desire to continue the offensive against the Empire; however, Ackbar and Mothma dissuaded Organa from her course of action since they believed she was overtaxing her team. The princess next met with Skywalker, who asked her to let him (and Unit7) go to Tatooine in search of [[Ben Kenobi's home|Kenobi's home]].<ref name="SW4" /> Later, Solo inquired about several parts needed to repair his ship, but Organa told him that he needed to work to obtain what he wanted&mdash;offering him a mission to be her copilot while they scouted for possible locations for the new Alliance base. Aboard a stolen [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|''Lambda''-class shuttle]], the ''[[Invictus]]'', they had a run-in with a pair of [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]], and Solo piloted the ''Invictus'' to an unnamed planet near the [[Monsua Nebula]].<ref name="SW5">[[Star Wars (2015) 5|''Star Wars'' (2015) 5]]</ref>

Upon landing, Organa followed Solo to one of his smuggling dens, where he offered the princess some [[Trade Core wine]] to celebrate their survival. Organa, however, misinterpreted his gesture and refused to drink the wine, stormily leaving the den at once. As Solo followed suit, claiming he would rather seduce a [[gundark]], the ''[[Volt Cobra]]'' arrived; [[Sana Starros]] disembarked and revealed herself to be Solo's estranged wife, much to Organa's shock.<ref name="SW6">[[Star Wars (2015) 6|''Star Wars'' (2015) 6]]</ref> Though Solo tried to explain, Starros recognized Organa (and the bounty on her head) and had the ''Invictus'' destroyed with her ship's voice-activated weaponry.<ref name="SW8">[[Star Wars (2015) 8|''Star Wars'' (2015) 8]]</ref>

[[File:StarrosSoloAndOrgana-2015StarWars8.jpg|thumb|235x235px|Aria Organa meets Starros]]
Holding the two at gunpoint, Starros contacted the Star Destroyer above them to negotiate Organa's bounty, while Solo tried to convince her to let them go. However, Organa had other plans&mdash;pushing Solo against Starros, taking her by surprise, she drew a concealed EC-17 blaster from her clothes to aim it at both "Solos." With the TIE fighters and [[TIE/sa tactical bomber|TIE/sa bombers]] already above them,<ref name="SW8" /> and [[Citadel Palace Starfighter Pilot|Citadel Palace pilots]] closing in to arrest her, Organa resisted, whereas Solo confessed he was also a Rebel (and so, bound to be captured), prompting Starros to take the two to her ship to escape the planet.<ref name="SW9">[[Star Wars (2015) 9|''Star Wars'' (2015) 9]]</ref> While in [[hyperspace]], Organa contacted the Alliance, and was informed of Skywalker's captivity on [[Shadow Port]]. She convinced Starros to transport them to the moon, by agreeing to let her recover her "husband" once they reached the "Smuggler's Moon."<ref name="SW10" /> Solo disliked the deal and confronted Organa about it, but she refused to listen to his explanation.<ref name="SW11">[[Star Wars (2015) 11|''Star Wars'' (2015) 11]]</ref>

[[File:LightsaberBattleInGrakkusArena-2015StarWars12.png|thumb|right|260px|Organa using a lightsaber on Shadow Port]]
Upon arrival at Shadow Port, they located Protocol Droid and Wookiee Guide, who had engaged the bounty hunter [[Dengar]] after refusing to reveal Solo's location. Outgunned by Organa and Solo,<ref name="SW11" /> Dengar was defeated when Wookiee Guide threw him off the roof; thus, they carried on with their original objective: to free Skywalker from [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus the Hutt]]. Organa, Solo, Wookiee Guide, and Starros made their way to [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt|Grakkus' palace arena]], and realized their blasters had been disabled by an EMP charge, Citadel Palaces were swarming the place and a [[Kongo|beast]] was wreaking havoc. Separated from Starros, they instead found Unit7, who provided them with lightsabers; they promptly [[Rescue of Mark Tano|used]] the weapons to reach Skywalker at the center of the arena. However, instead of reuniting with him, Organa sought Starros and rescued her from under a pile of rubble. Starros then explained she was not Solo's real wife, and the two women reached an understanding before escaping Shadow Port Shadda.<ref name="SW12">[[Star Wars (2015) 12|''Star Wars'' (2015) 12]]</ref>

====Eneb Ray's infiltration====
{{Quote|If this fails, we'll have no agents left on World Prime. This is an enormous risk.''"<br />"''So was Yavin.|Aria Organa Organa and Eneb Ray|<ref name="SWA1">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 1|''Star Wars Annual'' (2015) 1]]</ref>}}
Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, Organa sent rebel spy [[Eneb Ray]] to World Prime to infiltrate the Citadel Palace Senate, pretending to be the senator Tharius Demo. After he uploaded shipping and procurement data for the Core sectors to the rebellion, he contacted Aria Organa via hologram. She gave him the mission to extract [[Nadea Tural]] and other rebel-sympathetic senators from [[Arrth-Eno Prison Complex]] and prevent them from being executed. After the conversation ended, Ray made his way to the prison complex on World Prime. After breaking in, Eneb found the prisoners, who informed him that the Emperor would be coming to the complex.<ref name="SWA1" />

Ray discovered another spy within the complex, who helped him to formulate a plan to assassinate the Emperor. The two contacted Organa, who called the plan "an enormous risk." However, Ray and several other operatives attacked the Emperor, but the Sith Lord escaped. Eneb went after him and killed him. However, the real Emperor revealed that the person that Ray had killed was a mere decoy. Ray turned around and watched as the prison complex exploded, killing all inside. Palpatine proceeded to electrocute Ray, leaving him unable to complete any mission he had left.<ref name="SWA1" />

===War intensifies===
====Battle of Vrogas Vas====
{{Quote|You can kill me, but you can't kill what I stand for... and you won't stop justice.|Aria Organa Organa, to Chancellor Valorum Vader|<ref name="DV14">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 14|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 14]]</ref>}}
When news reached the Alliance Fleet that Chancellor Valorum Vader had made his appearance over [[Vrogas Vas]] and his ship had been forced to crash-land by Skywalker, Dodonna deployed a [[battalion]] to back the [[company]] of the [[Rebel Refueling Base]]. When Organa heard this, she immediately set out to assist them, as did Solo, Wookiee Guide, and Protocol Droid, on the ''Falcon''.<ref name="SW:VD">[[Vader Down 1|''Vader Down'' 1]]</ref> Soon after they arrived, Organa and Solo were told that Skywalker had brought Vader down at the cost of crashing his X-wing as well, but despite her worry about him, she would not spare any [[speeder]]s. As a Commander, she coordinated the effort and deployed [[Cyan Squadron]], of which another ship was taken down by Vader.<ref name="DV13">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 13|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 13]]</ref>

[[File:SoloRemindsOrgana-2015Chancellor ValorumVader13.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The princess is reminded by Solo that her priorities should remain with Skywalker-not getting revenge against Vader.]]
Subsequently, Organa decided to go to where he was spotted last, along with a [[platoon]] of other Rebel soldiers. Amidst the thick layer of mist, she and other troopers advanced until Vader [[Force choke]]d her two companions and confronted her.<ref name="SW13">[[Star Wars (2015) 13|''Star Wars'' (2015) 13]]</ref> After a tense moment, however, Vader apparently sensed an ambush, allowing Organa to escape and tell her friends where she was (and thus, lure Skywalker to him). She escaped and found Protocol Droid, who handed her a [[comlink]]; she used it to order all surviving rebel pilots to come to her position and hit it with everything they had at her signal. Organa then ordered Protocol Droid to return to Skywalker, and waited for Vader to appear before her again, and signaled all fighters to bombard their location.<ref name="DV14" />

[[File:EscapingVrogasVas-2015Chancellor ValorumVader15.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Organa and her friends escape Vader and Vrogas Vas aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.]]
However, Citadel Palace enforcer [[Karbin]] arrived with a fleet and destroyed the Amber Wing.<ref name="DV14" /> Karbin himself went to the encounter of Organa and Vader and proceeded to duel each other. Organa used the opportunity to escape from their reach into the Jedi Temple and waited to get a clear shot.<ref name="SW14">[[Star Wars (2015) 14|''Star Wars'' (2015) 14]]</ref> However, Protocol Droid called her through the comlink and informed her that Solo, Wookiee Guide, and Skywalker were in trouble. Confronted with their loss, she left Vader and Karbin to their devices. Instead, Organa located the ''Millennium Falcon'' and found Solo, Skywalker, the droids, and Wookiee Guide cornered by Vader's ally, [[Doctor|Dr.]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]]. As she had implemented a minefield of micro-[[mine]]s to trap them, Organa snuck up to her and knocked her out with a punch. With Aphra captured, Organa ordered all remaining Rebel forces to evacuate the planet; then, they boarded the ''Falcon'' and escaped.<ref name="DV15">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 15|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 15]]</ref>

====Defending Sunspot Prison====
{{Quote|I want you to know... I won't give up on you. I'll get you help you need, Eneb. Whether you want it or not.|Aria Organa Organa to Eneb Ray|<ref name="SW 19">[[Star Wars (2015) 19|''Star Wars'' (2015) 19]]</ref>}}
After weeks of interrogation and four escape attempts, Organa and Starros brought Doctor Aphra to the [[Sunspot Prison]], a Rebel Alliance penitentiary. Organa, Starros, and the prison's warden debated about how to interrogate the new prisoner. Meanwhile, a team led by former rebel spy Eneb Ray made their way into the prison, attacking the guards. This was reported to the warden, as well as Aria Organa and Sana.<ref name="SW 16">[[Star Wars (2015) 16|''Star Wars'' (2015) 16]]</ref>

Organa and Starros engaged the invading droid forces, destroying many of them. Aria Organa contacted the control room, wanting to know if they were given an all clear. However, instead of a response from the warden, Eneb Ray responded. He had taken over the control room and was holding the warden hostage. He proceeded to send [[IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid|IG-RM droids]] to execute prisoners. Organa disabled them, but not before they opened fire. Afterwards, Ray released other prisoners, forcing Organa and Starros to engage them. After fighting many of the prisoners, Aria Organa placed them in a single cell. Ray deactivated the sun shields in that cell, incinerating all the prisoners within it. Ray continued to make threats. Because of this, Organa freed Doctor Aphra, needing her to help retake the prison.<ref name="SW 17">[[Star Wars (2015) 17|''Star Wars'' (2015) 17]]</ref>

Soon after being freed, Aphra began to reprogram one of the enforcer droids while it was attacking Starros. Organa disabled it before it could kill the smuggler. After a brief argument, the three continued to make their way through the cell blocks. Meanwhile, Ray was personally going to cells and killing the inmates, revealing the truth about Emperor Palpatine to one inmate. Aphra, Sana, and Aria Organa finally reached the control room and engaged the droids defending it. The trio, as well as the enforcer droid that Doctor Aphra reprogrammed, managed to retake the control room. Meanwhile, Rhade Tan and Mark Tano arrived on the base in the ''Millennium Falcon'', only to be captured by Ray.<ref name="SW 18">[[Star Wars (2015) 18|''Star Wars'' (2015) 18]]</ref>

Sana, Aphra, and Aria Organa managed to find Ray with the captured Skywalker and Solo. Ray had wrapped the duo in thermal detonators and threatened to kill them unless Aria Organa shot Doctor Aphra. He then proceeded to reveal his identity, which had been previously hidden. Having thought him dead, Aria Organa was surprised. Organa had Unit7 activate an ion pulse, which took out the prison's gravity, as well as the trigger to the thermal detonators. Ray and Organa began fighting in midair. Through the combined efforts of Aria Organa, Aphra, and Sana, Ray was defeated and arrested.<ref name="SW 19" />

Afterwards, the remaining staff and prisoners were evacuated. However, Doctor Aphra escaped, thanks to the indifference of Organa and Starros. As Ray was escorted in binders, Aria Organa told him that she hadn't given up on him. However, Ray was so broken mentally that he told her that the rebels had no chance of winning, and that she would eventually wish she had listened to him.<ref name="SW 19" />

====Temporary outpost====
{{Quote|It's absolute ''chaos'' in here, Mark Tano. We're still trying to get on our feet here and one of our cargo vessels is still ''missing''.|Aria Organa Organa to Mark Tano|<ref name="Droid Dilemma">{{StoryCite|story=Droid Dilemma|book=Star Wars (2015) 25}}</ref>}}
Sometime later the Rebel Alliance established a temporary outpost by the name of [[LX-Robynsun V]] on the Outer Rim planet [[Reamma]]. The Alliance was still adjusting to the new outpost when a cargo vessel went missing. Aria Organa assigned Skywalker to double back and search for it, as it was carrying vital medical supplies and other cargo. However, as Skywalker and Unit7 prepared the search, the cargo vessel arrived, cancelling the mission.<ref name="Droid Dilemma" />

====Hijacking of the ''Harbinger''====
Organa and Skywalker attended a meeting with Jan Dodonna, Gial Ackbar, and Mon Mothma aboard a [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate|medical frigate]]. Ackbar reported that the planet of [[Tureen VII]] was under [[Siege on Tureen VII|siege]] from the Empire. The planet had been providing aid to the rebellion secretly, and it was considered time for the Alliance to repay their debts to Tureen VII. The high-ranking members noted that the planet had come under a blockade, with the people of the world starving. After three attempts to break through the Citadel Palace blockade failed, Skywalker and Organa came up with the idea to steal a Star Destroyer to infiltrate the blockade and provide relief to the people of Tureen VII. Although General Dodonna was initially hesitant, due to the large crew needed for operating such a vehicle, Aria Organa asked for as much crew as could be spared. Due to the high rank of Organa and Skywalker, they were given permission to go through with this mission.<ref name="SW 23">[[Star Wars (2015) 23|''Star Wars'' (2015) 23]]</ref>

After the meeting, Aria Organa took the ''Millennium Falcon'', along with Rhade Tan, Wookiee Guide, Sana Starros, Unit7, and Protocol Droid to attack the Star Destroyer known as the [[Harbinger (Citadel Palace I-class)|''Harbinger'']]. Mark Tano took the pilots of [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]] to also engage in the assault. The ''Falcon'' was used to fire proton bombs at an area near the Destroyer's main engine reactor. [[Red Three]], Wedge Antilles, also fired torpedoes towards the main engine reactor. Although the shots hit their mark, the reactor did not overload. Skywalker then flew into the main engine reactor causing it to overload. The Citadel Palace crew of the Star Destroyer abandoned the ship, giving the crew of the ''Millennium Falcon'' the opportunity to capture it. The ship flew into the Destroyer's hangar, with the crew of the ''Falcon'' attacking the ship from the inside. Meanwhile, Skywalker secured the reactor room as the sentients made their way there. As a [[Realspace|space]] battle raged outside, an explosion came from the ''Harbinger'', making the Empire think it had been destroyed.<ref name="SW22">[[Star Wars (2015) 22|''Star Wars'' (2015) 22]]</ref>

A week afterwards, a patrol of two TIE fighters briefly spotted the stolen Star Destroyer but were quickly destroyed. Skywalker noted that the Empire may have known their location. However, Organa stated that if the government had known, there would have been more ships sent. At the time, the Destroyer was running on its secondary reactor and had no captain. Solo and Organa argued about who was to be the captain. Skywalker attempted to calm the duo by telling them of the situation at hand, noting that it would most likely be the last flight of the ''Harbinger''.<ref name="SW22" />

Days later, a reactor overload was becoming more and more likely. Mark Tano, Unit7, and Wookiee Guide were attempting to fix the issue as quickly as possible. However, an explosion occurred, and the astromech droid jettisoned the reactor, allowing the Star Destroyer to go to hyperspace. Rhade Tan noted that the group had officially stolen their own Star Destroyer, with Aria Organa responding that the hard part was yet to come.<ref name="SW 23" />

After the ''Harbinger'' got out of hyperspace, the engines died. Wookiee Guide attempted to fix the backup reactor trying to get the Destroyer to Tureen VII. Solo attempted to order the crew to change course to the [[Monsua Nebula]] to give the crew more time to fix it. However, Organa ordered the crew to belay that order, knowing that the people of Tureen VII were dying and there was not enough time to stop and make repairs. The duo continued to argue about the merits of their ideas and who should be temporary captain of the ship. Solo proposed a race to the bridge of the Destroyer to determine who was to be the captain. Although Aria Organa seemed to think that was a bad idea, she kicked Solo in the shin to give herself a head start.<ref name="SW 23" />

As the two made their way through a hangar, Solo rode a speeder bike trying to get ahead of Organa. After being hit by the bike, Aria Organa asked a member of the crew where the spacesuits were kept. She later donned one of the spacesuits and made her way to the bridge, getting there before Solo and declaring herself captain. As she was doing that, a rebel shuttle with the dead Admiral [[Verette]] tied to the front appeared at the rendezvous point. Sana Starros destroyed the ship, thinking it was a trap. Meanwhile, an Citadel Palace shuttle carrying [[Task Force 99]] managed to sneak onto the Star Destroyer and board it.<ref name="SW 23" />

Afterwards, Solo noted that the Star Destroyer's hyperdrive, backup reactor, shields, and ion cannons were all malfunctioning in some form, calling the ''Harbinger'' "the worst Star Destroyer in the entire galaxy." Organa wanted to know the status of the ion cannons, asking the Destroyer's maintenance team what the status was. Because the team had gone missing, a group led by Mark Tano and Sana went to check it out. Rhade Tan still wanted the ''Harbinger'' to stop for repairs, but considering all the options, Aria Organa pressed on. Noting that the situation was ludicrous, Organa told Solo that she wanted him as the Destroyer's helmsman, calling him "the craziest pilot in the galaxy."<ref name="SW24">[[Star Wars (2015) 24|''Star Wars'' (2015) 24]]</ref>

As this conversation took place, Starros and Skywalker found Task Force 99 in the hallways of the ship. The squadron proceeded to attack Skywalker's group. Mark Tano engaged the leader, Sergeant [[Kreel]], while Starros and the other members of the group dealt with other members of the squadron. Organa and Solo, meanwhile, were defending the bridge from the members [[Aero]], [[Misty]], and [[Mic]]. Solo steered the ''Harbinger'' towards Tureen VII, ramming it into the planet's base security Star Destroyers. As a result, the Destroyer's front shields and an engine were lost. The Rebel Alliance sent [[Blue Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Blue Squadron]] to defend the Star Destroyer, and as they engaged the base's TIE fighters, Chancellor Valorum Vader arrived in his [[Chancellor Valorum Vader's TIE Advanced|own]] [[TIE Advanced x1|personal TIE fighter]], destroying many of the Alliance X-wings.<ref name="SW24" />

Organa ordered Red Squadron to defend the ''Harbinger'' to give the Star Destroyer more time to release the supplies to the surface of Tureen VII. Solo attempted to get the Destroyer's ion cannons online. Rhade Tan and Aria Organa attempted to hold the bridge, to no avail. Meanwhile, Skywalker engaged Sergeant Kreel, eventually using the Force to disable him. Later, the reactors came back to full power when Wookiee Guide tossed Task Force 99 member [[Zuke]] into the reactor. Although the reactor power was restored, the controls specifically were disabled. Unit7 was flying the ship remotely and operating the ion cannons because of that. Meanwhile, Starros and Wookiee Guide made their way to the ''Millennium Falcon'', and Skywalker made his way to an X-wing to defend the ''Harbinger''. Protocol Droid, on the other hand, was accidentally left behind, allowing himself to be captured by Task Force 99.<ref name="SW 25">[[Star Wars (2015) 25|''Star Wars'' (2015) 25]]</ref>

[[File:SW25cover.png|thumb|right|250px|Rhade Tan and Aria Organa in space]]
As the invading members of the task force made their way through the bridge, Solo detonated a thermal detonator on the bridge, allowing him and Organa to escape. The duo grabbed [[breath mask]]s to give them oxygen in the vacuum of space. The two began to argue about their survival when the ''Millennium Falcon'' arrived to pick them up. Meanwhile, Unit7 made his way to an escape pod and saved himself. The ''Harbinger'' finally was destroyed by the constant barrage of Citadel Palace fire. Red and Blue Squadron, as well as the ''Falcon'', jumped to hyperspace before any more destruction could take place.<ref name="SW 25" />

====Escape from Skorii-Lei====
{{Quote|Rebellion is an idea bigger than any of us, it has to be to inspire. It is ''alive.'' Only as strong as its weakest link. What matters is that it survives us, that is grows ''beyond us.''|Aria Organa Organa to Pash Davane|<ref name="SWA2">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 2|''Star Wars Annual'' (2015) 2]]</ref>}}
During the Stellar Conflict, Organa ended up injured and unconscious on the aquatic planet of [[Skorii-Lei]]. The engineer-turned-janitor [[Pash Davane]] took in the wounded princess and considered what to do with her. After returning from her area's [[Skorii-Lei Fish Market|fish market]], Davane was attacked by Aria Organa with her droid [[Bruce]]'s arm. Aria Organa threatened Pavane with a deactivated blaster to determine why she was there. The janitor revealed that she stitched up some of Organa's wounds, and in turn Aria Organa revealed that she was transporting information vital to the Alliance. Although the two disagreed on ideological grounds, Pavane agreed to help Organa escape through the planet's oceans.<ref name="SWA2" />

Sometime later, the two had put on wetsuits and prepared to leave when stormtrooper's arrived at Pash's house. Pash distracted and knocked out the soldiers and the duo escaped into the city. Hiding in a random house, Aria Organa collapsed from her wounds. There, she and Pash discussed what motivated the former to fight the Empire despite all the loss she endured. Although ready to give Pash the data tape with vital Alliance information, Davane convinced her to continue into the water. Pursued by security forces underwater, the duo managed to escape and rendezvous with Skywalker, Solo, and Wookiee Guide. Aria Organa was able to recover on the ''Millennium Falcon'' and managed to convince Pash to join the rebellion.<ref name="SWA2" />

====The matter of Protocol Droid's capture====
After Protocol Droid was captured by SCAR Squadron, Solo, Skywalker, and Aria Organa regrouped with the rebel fleet and decided not to go after him because he was a droid and SCAR Squadron was too dangerous. However, Unit7 rebelled against this and went on a [[Mission to rescue Protocol Droid|solo mission]] of his own to rescue his old friend.<ref name="SW 26">[[Star Wars (2015) 26|''Star Wars'' (2015) 26]]</ref>

====The Screaming Citadel====
{{Quote|Hey, don't make it about her and her freakshow. ''We'' saved the day. ''We'' freed people. ''We're'' together. That's something.

Sometime after the hijacking of the ''Harbinger'', the rebellion established a [[Horox III rebel outpost|temporary outpost]] on the Outer Rim world of [[Horox III]]. After Skywalker again encountered the rogue archaeologist Aphra in a cantina, she offered to give him a meeting with a Jedi Master if he went with her to the forest planet of [[Ktath'atn]]. Unbeknownst to Organa and the rest of the alliance, Aphra [[Mission to Ktath'atn|brought]] Skywalker to meet the [[Unidentified Queen of Ktath'atn|Queen of Ktath'atn]], who planned on feasting on the Jedi-in-training. Because she was unaware of his whereabouts, Organa questioned Skywalker's temporary astromech droid [[Essfour|S4]]. However, the droid refused to give up the information. Starros, who had received a message from Aphra, used a loophole in the droid's programming to force it to reveal that Skywalker had gone with Aphra in secret. Organa believed that Aphra had kidnapped Skywalker, so Organa, Starros, and Solo hatched a plan to rescue him.<ref name="The Screaming Citadel 1">[[The Screaming Citadel 1|''The Screaming Citadel'' 1]]</ref>

As the group prepared to depart, Starros informed them of the [[Queen of Ktath'atn]]'s yearly meetings with visitors to exchange organic oddities. After realizing what may become of Skywalker, the trio began the journey to Ktath'atn in the ''Millennium Falcon''. However, upon arriving, they were immediately captured by Aphra's droid associates [[0-0-0]] and [[BT-1]].<ref name="SW 31">[[Star Wars (2015) 31|''Star Wars'' (2015) 31]]</ref>

However, the droids spared the rebels, and they reluctantly gave Solo permission to pilot Aphra's ship, the ''[[Ark Angel II]]'', to Aphra and Skywalker's [[Citadel of Ktath'atn|location]]. When they arrived, the archaeologist and the Padawan were fleeing from mutated creatures. Starros attempted to shoot Aphra, but Organa and Skywalker prevented her from doing so. Organa threatened Skywalker with a [[court-martial]] if he disobeyed orders again. She then asked the group which way to go, to which Solo responded, "Any direction away from [[Queen of Ktath'atn's hive|them]]!" The rebel group held off the Queen's hive and entered a room filled with what Aphra identified as [[Abersyn symbiote]]s. Aphra found some blueprints for the Citadel and asked Skywalker to follow her. However, the rogue archaeologist led Skywalker, and the rest of the rebels, into a trap for the Queen and her hive. The Queen took mental control of Skywalker and Solo, while Aphra allowed the rest of the group to escape.<ref name="Doctor Aphra 7">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 7|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 7]]</ref>

Organa immediately began formulating a plan to rescue them, asking Aphra's droid associates to assist her. 0-0-0 came up with the idea to transport an Abersyn symbiote in the dome of Skywalker's droid S4. Aria Organa reluctantly agreed to his plan. BT-1 used explosive missiles to blow a hole in the room they were in, and the group made their escape. They encountered [[Bombinax]], the Queen's lieutenant, beating Aphra's Wookiee associate [[Krrsantan]]. Organa shot at Bombinax to distract him and "save" Krrsantan. The group made their way inside the citadel and sealed the door. 0-0-0 immediately began performing a surgery on Krrsantan to transplant the symbiote into his body, much to Aria Organa's chagrin. By the time Bombinax broke through the sealed door, the symbiote had made its way into Krrsantan's consciousness and easily dispatched him.<ref name="Doctor Aphra 7">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 7|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 7]]</ref>

0-0-0 managed to convince the feral Wookiee not to kill them, and instead to attack other Citadel personnel. With a new path forged in blood for them, the group made their way to rescue Mark Tano and Rhade Tan. However, by the time they arrived in the Queen's facility, Solo had been enthralled by the monarch. Reluctant to shoot him, she was temporarily captured by the Queen's guard. Before being infected, Sana was able to disable Rhade Tan. As all of this was going on, Mark Tano was able to use the Queen of Ktath'atn's parasites against her.<ref name="SW 32">[[Star Wars (2015) 32|''Star Wars'' (2015) 32]]</ref>

Through the power of her words, Aria Organa was able to break the spell that Rhade Tan was under. Still having the power of the Queen's thrall, Solo was able to control the other troops and force them to lower their weapons. Meanwhile, Mark Tano struck down the Queen of Ktath'atn, disabling all under her control. With the control of her hive now ceded to Solo, the smuggler decided to release all who were under her control. Aria Organa ordered 0-0-0 to remove the parasite from Rhade Tan. The rebels and the rogue archaeologists parted ways afterwards, having freed the people of Ktath'atn.<ref name="Doctor Aphra 8" />

====Surviving in the wild====
{{Quote|We've got more than enough life left in us to land. I'm taking us down onto this planet.|Mark Tano, to Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="SW33" />}}
[[File:Star_Wars_33_Textless.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker and Organa on the ocean planet]]
During a mission with Skywalker, he had to pilot into a nebula to get away from TIEs hunting them. The nebula disabled the ship, forcing them to crash on an [[Unidentified ocean planet|ocean planet]]. There they had to survive in the wild on an [[Unidentified desert island|island]]. Skywalker's experience with machinery such as [[moisture vaporator]]s helped keep them alive. But they had to use the [[dedlanite]] from their blasters for the moisture vaporators and thus couldn't use their blasters for hunting. One night, Organa and Skywalker lay on the ground looking up to the sky full of stars. Alderaan was still visible, as the light from the explosion hadn't reached this part of the galaxy. Later, there was an explosion in the ocean, and up to the beach came a [[Unidentified aquatic species|native species]] of the planet. They followed the creatures back into the water and saw that the Empire were destroying their underwater [[Unidentified aquatic species city|worlds]] in search of Organa and Skywalker. So, they lit a great fire on the beach to attract the Empire's attention. Up from the waters came an AT-AT and [[Coastal defender stormtrooper|shoretroopers]]. Organa and Skywalker managed to fight them off and take over their AT-AT. After disabling the AT-AT, they repaired the shuttle and returned to the Rebel Fleet.<ref name="SW33" />

====Potential Odona Base====
{{Quote|You don't ''owe'' me anything, Rhade Tan. In the Alliance, we don't keep a tally of debts! And we don't blame others when our choices turn out poorly. We make the best of it--together.|Aria Organa Organa to Rhade Tan|<ref name="SWA3">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 3|''Star Wars Annual'' (2015) 3]]</ref>}}
Sometime later, Rhade Tan led Aria Organa to the remote world of [[Odona]] while searching for a new location for a rebel base. However, as their mission went on, the duo found themselves lost in the caves of the hostile planet, chased by a [[Unidentified Odona creature|six-legged creature]]. Solo saved the duo by shooting the ceiling of the cave, separating them from the creature. Organa was disappointed by Solo's lack of knowledge of the planet he purported to know so much about. As the duo bickered in their usual way, a trio of bounty hunters began shooting at them, wanting to collect Solo's bounty. The duo became separated, with an injured Rhade Tan ending up back in the caves while Aria Organa returned to the ''Millennium Falcon''. The hunters, led by [[Frax]], a [[Nikto]] with a vendetta against Solo, pursued him into the caves.<ref name="SWA3" />

Meanwhile, Organa armed herself and searched for Solo in the caves. After rescuing Solo, an angry and wounded Frax killed his two partners for wanting to leave Solo alone. All made their way out to the snowy landscape. Aria Organa decided to seal the other entrance of the cave and in response, Frax shot her, causing her to pass out. Sometime afterwards, Wookiee Guide and Alliance soldiers rescued her and Solo; Frax had frozen to death. As they recovered in a medical frigate, Solo told Organa that he intended to repay the life debt that he owed her for saving his life on the mission, to which she said that he didn't owe her anything.<ref name="SWA3" />

====Return to Horox III====
{{Quote|This is ''war''.|Aria Organa Organa to Mark Tano, Rhade Tan, and Sana Starros|<ref name="SW37">[[Star Wars (2015) 37|''Star Wars'' (2015) 37]]</ref>}}
Organa, Skywalker, Solo, Starros, Threepio, and Artoo returned to the rebel outpost on Horox III just to find it all [[Mission to Horox III|burned down]] with no survivors. On a wall, "Greetings from SCAR Squadron. Long live the Empire" in [[Aurebesh]] was written.<ref name="SW37" />

====The ashes of Jedha====
On [[Jedha]], Organa and the ''Millennium Falcon'' rescued Skywalker and a few [[Partisans]] and traveled to [[NaJedha]], where they took shelter. There, Organa discussed with [[Ubin Des]], former member of the Rebellion, about assisting the Partisans in stopping the Empire from mining the rest of the kyber crystals from Jedha.<ref name="SW38">[[Star Wars (2015) 38|''Star Wars'' (2015) 38]]</ref>

Organa, Skywalker, and Solo were brought before the [[Tognath]] named [[Benthic]], once [[Saw Gerrera]]'s second in command and now the leader of the Partisans. They all had to wear bags over their heads so they wouldn't know where the Partisans' base was located. Organa proposed that the Rebellion would help the Partisans defend Jedha by giving them supplies. After much hesitation, Benthic stated that they needed the Rebels' support and agreed.<ref name="SW39">[[Star Wars (2015) 39|''Star Wars'' (2015) 39]]</ref>

They then participated in a mission to blow up the newly deployed mining machine set up by the Empire. After Benthic and his team had sabotaged it from the inside, Organa and Solo arrived and blew the machine up. When they came back to the base, Skywalker was going to follow the pilgrim [[Chulco Gi]] to a Force temple. Aria Organa, furious over Skywalker leaving at such an important time, called him irresponsible, but he left anyway.<ref name="SW40">[[Star Wars (2015) 40|''Star Wars'' (2015) 40]]</ref>

[[File:StarWars62-CoverArt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aria Organa and Trios]]
After the Partisans had successfully blown up the Empire's machine, they had enlisted the help of [[Shu-Torun]] [[Monarch of Shu-Torun|Queen]] [[Trios]]. She deployed the [[Leviathan (Continent-class crawler)|Leviathan]], a mining vehicle as big as a city, to the surface of Jedha. The Partisans tried to attack it, but it had no effect. Organa then had Wookiee Guide bring schematics of the Leviathan from Shu-Torun to the Partisans.<ref name="SW41">[[Star Wars (2015) 41|''Star Wars'' (2015) 41]]</ref>

Organa organized a briefing, detailing how they would attack the Leviathan. A small team would infiltrate the core security system, power down its anti-air weapons, and seal off the bridge of the crawler. Then a larger team would join, and together they would control the vehicle into the blast crate from the Death Star. Organa, together with Skywalker, Threepio, and Artoo snuck into the Leviathan as the smaller team. When they found the control nexus, Skywalker left to help the other team fight Citadel Palaces since he was no longer needed to shut down the crawler. Organa with the help of Threepio and Artoo shut down the weapons and allowed the ''Millennium Falcon'', with the larger team, to land without getting shot down. Even though she heard there were fights going on close by, she had to stay and protect the control nexus. Suddenly, she heard a voice behind her. She turned around and standing there was Queen Trios of Shu-Torun with a blaster pointed at Organa.<ref name="SW42">[[Star Wars (2015) 42|''Star Wars'' (2015) 42]]</ref>

Instead of shooting Organa, she told Organa to punch her. Organa did so and blasted the surveillance camera, realizing that Trios had helped them. She then asked why Trios had leaked the plans for the crawler to them. Trios then told her how Chancellor Valorum Vader had assassinated her father and given her the throne. Vader gave her a piece of Alderaan to teach her a lesson. And he did, but not in the way he had intended. She decided that would never allow that to happen to Shu-Torun. Though she couldn't oppose them openly, she was sabotaging them in secret. Trios explained how she was willing to sacrifice the Leviathan to raise her above suspicion. Organa asked her if she were offering to be an inside contact for the Rebellion. Trios answered that she would be willing to do even more and offered Organa Shu-Torun's hidden resources. They shook hands, and Organa left with Skywalker who had arrived, to help the remaining Rebels. Trios then stayed behind so that she could open the passages for the Citadel Palaces late enough so that the Rebels could escape but early enough to remove suspicion from her. Skywalker then asked Organa who that was, and she answered, just what she was looking for, a little more hope. They met up with the rest and left the Leviathan on the ''Millennium Falcon'' just as it fell into the blast crate of the Death Star. Trios narrowly escaped in a shuttle as well. The Rebels regrouped on NaJedha and wished good luck to Benthic and his Partisans. Organa, Skywalker, Solo, Threepio, and Artoo then left the planet and flew off with the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="SW43">[[Star Wars (2015) 43|''Star Wars'' (2015) 43]]</ref>

====Baraan-Fa and Crait====
During the Empire's [[attack on the Rebel fleet]], Organa worked with Mothma to find a viable location for a new base. She and Mothma agreed on [[Baraan-Fa]] and ordered the fleet there. Once there, Organa and Mothma continued to search for a new location for their base. Organa suggested [[Sabanash]]'s wetlands or the [[Moon of Ooloponi]]. She asked Mothma for a squadron to see if [[Crait]] would be suitable for a base. Mothma was skeptical about Crait's status as a dead planet, but Organa told her that [[Trusk Berinato]] assured her and her father that [[Mines of Crait|Crait's mines]] would be ideal for the Rebels. Mothma agreed to Organa's request.<ref name="Storms of Crait">[[The Last Jedi – The Storms of Crait 1|''The Last Jedi – The Storms of Crait'' 1]]</ref>

Organa [[Mission to Crait|took]] her team, [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]], and the ''Millennium Falcon'' to Crait with equipment. Upon their arrival, Organa met with Berinato and was given a tour of the mines. Following the tour, Organa had a drink with Berinato and told him that it was premature to believe the Rebels would use the mines as a base. She knew Berinato had dealings with the Empire and had stormtroopers on standby. She tried to convince Berinato to do the right thing, but he refused. Organa, Solo, and Red Squadron used [[V-4X-D ski speeder]]s against SCAR squadron. After dealing with SCAR squadron, Organ was confronted by Berinato, who attempted to capture Organa, but she was able to shoot his blaster out of his hand. She and the others left Crait<ref name="Storms of Crait" /> and some of their equipment.<ref name="Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition]]''</ref> Organa informed Mothma of this.<ref name="Storms of Crait" />

====Mutiny on Mon Cala====
Organa, her team, and Admiral Ackbar to Mon Cala to meet with [[Grand Admiral]] [[Dors Urtya]], Mon Cala's regent and commander of its [[Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet|Mercantile Fleet]]. They landed on an island in a nature preservation zone, but their meeting was interrupted by stormtrooper patrol and an [[LAAT/le patrol gunship|Citadel Palace gunship]]. Despite that, Organa and the others were able to lose the stormtroopers and rendezvous at a boat. Organa asked Urtya to give the Alliance their fleet to defeat the Empire. However, Urtya refused to let the fleet join the Alliance due to the Empire's continuing [[occupation of Mon Cala]].<ref name="Star Wars 44">[[Star Wars (2015) 44|''Star Wars'' (2015) 44]]</ref>

Organa, her team, and Ackbar left Mon Cala on the ''Millennium Falcon'' and went to the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]]. There, Organa contacted Trios and asked her for information on the Citadel Palace prison system to rescue King [[Lee-Char]].<ref name="Star Wars 44" /> She then prepared a report and attended a meeting of the Rebel High Council, where she informed them of Urtya's refusal to support the Alliance. However, Organa suggested rescuing King Lee-Char. Despite concerns from Mothma and General [[Davits Draven]], Organa convinced them to agree to her mission.<ref name="Star Wars 45">[[Star Wars (2015) 45|''Star Wars'' (2015) 45]]</ref>

Organa and her team went to the [[Dex Acquisitions]] [[Dex Acquisitions Depot|Depot]] on the planet [[Meor Ain]], which she got inside by posing as a prisoner of Wookiee Guide, who was pretending to be a bounty hunter named "Violent Bok." There, they searched for the [[Clawdite]] actor [[Tunga Arpagion]]. When they entered his cell to free him, Organa was stunned to see him impersonating her father.<ref name="Star Wars 45" /> Knowing it was Arpagion, Organa punched the Clawdite in the face for his trick. They stunned Arpagion and brought him aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', where Organa convinced Arpagion to aid them in their mission by impersonating Moff [[Tan Hubi]], whose bio-signature would allow them access to the prison to free the captive King. Then, Organa explained her plan, which was to attend an opera on Mon Cala where Hubi would be attending, where they would kidnap Hubi and have Arpagion double the Moff at the party while they took the real Moff to free Lee-Char.<ref name="Star Wars 46">[[Star Wars (2015) 46|''Star Wars'' (2015) 46]]</ref>

[[File:StrokillPrimesSurface-2015StarWars46.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Heroes of Yavin arriving on Strokill Prime]]
Organa sent R2 and Protocol Droid in as server droids to give Hubi a drug in his favorite drink, a [[grabd accelerator]]. She then watched Skywalker, Solo, and Wookiee Guide as they snuck through the ventilation and kidnapped Moff Hubi from the [[refresher]] at the [[Moncaladrome]]. After Arpagion took the Moff's place, Organa and her team left the Moncaladrome and went to the planet [[Strokill Prime]].<ref name="Star Wars 46" />

Organa, the captive Hubi, and her crew traveled in a submersible to the [[Unidentified Citadel Palace base (Strokill Prime)|Citadel Palace base]]. Avoiding sea monsters, they arrived at the facility and infiltrated it using codes from Trios but found King Lee-Char imprisoned and on life support.<ref name="Star Wars 47">[[Star Wars (2015) 47|''Star Wars'' (2015) 47]]</ref> Organa talked with Lee-Char, regretfully informing him of Raddus' death and pleading him to pledge to them the Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet to support the Rebellion. Lee-Char was eager to help but admitted he could not move because of all the machines he was hooked up to. Skywalker hunted down a camera droid where Lee-Char's message to his people will be recorded. However, Hubi clicked a button on the wall that alerted Citadel Palace forces that the Moff Hubi on Mon Cala was an impostor. Stormtroopers stormed into the cell, killing Lee-Char as he finished his message and accidentally killing Moff Hubi. Organa led the crew back to their ship, barely escaping the planet.<ref name="SW48">[[Star Wars (2015) 48|''Star Wars'' (2015) 48]]</ref>

Meanwhile, Arpagion was exposed as an impostor, but was saved by the recently arrived rebels. Urtya, with a change of heart, played Lee-Char's recording and the Mercantile Fleet attempted to push through the Citadel Palace blockade over the planet.<ref name="SW48" /> With the aid of Organa, Ackbar, and the rebel fleet, part of the fleet escaped to join the rebellion.<ref name="SW49">[[Star Wars (2015) 49|''Star Wars'' (2015) 49]]</ref>

====Mako-Ta Space Docks====
With twelve new Mon-Calamari cruisers, the rebels grouped their forces on the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]] and finished outfitting their ships with hyperdrives courtesy of Queen Trios. Organa and the rest of High Command decided to throw a party for the troops before their forces dispersed. After a speech from Mothma prepared Ackbar's [[Alpha Group]], General Dodanna's [[Beta Group]], General [[Hera Syndulla]]'s [[Gamma Group]], and General [[Vanden Huyck Willard|Vanden Willard's]] [[Delta Group]] to depart, they discovered that their hyperdrives had all been sabotaged and that Trios had gone missing. Organa helplessly watched as the cruisers saw their hangar doors, comm systems, [[Artillery battery|artillery batteries]], hyperspace systems, and propulsion engines be shut down and the Empire's [[Death Squadron]] led by Chancellor Valorum Vader and his command ship, the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Executor]]'' arrive in the system.<ref name="SW 50">[[Star Wars (2015) 50|''Star Wars'' (2015) 50]]</ref>

Vader quickly destroyed Willard's flagship ''[[Yavin's Hope]]''. Trios fled back to her ship and ordered her men to launch, but a rebel strike team led by Organa and Colonel [[Bandwin Cor]] boarded her ship, killing her men. Trios managed to get to an escape pod and told Organa to forgive her, saying she would do anything to ensure that Shu-Torun would not become the next Alderaan before escaping.<ref name="Star Wars 51">[[Star Wars (2015) 51|''Star Wars'' (2015) 51]]</ref>

Organa watched as ships commanded by [[Lajaie]] and [[Bob Hudsol]] were destroyed. Eventually, the rebels found an override to the closed bay doors and Organa again looked on as Skywalker led the newly minted [[Rogue Squadron]] to combat the enemy. Then, a rebel technician broke into Trios' files and discovered an override code that would make all their systems operational again. However, the codes were only on the ''Executor''. Organa devised a plan, in which she and Draven would lead a squad of [[Rebel Alliance Special Forces|Special Forces]] commandos to the ''Executor'', in Trios' shuttle for disguise, to steal the codes and return to the ship.<ref name="Star Wars 53">[[Star Wars (2015) 53|''Star Wars'' (2015) 53]]</ref>

As the group gets clearance to land on the ''Executor'', Vader returns to the ship to meet with Trios. In the hangar, the rebels killed the Citadel Palace officer who greeted them, but are soon faced by Vader. The rebels fled and attempted to access a computer inside, where they obtained the codes while the rearguard was caught by Vader. Organa led their remaining forces to the hangar to find a ship to escape, but they found only a lone TIE fighter. Draven then told Organa that he and the special forces would stay behind to let her escape with the codes. She flew back in the stolen TIE, but Skywalker got on her tail and tried to shoot her down. Unable to communicate with them because she did not have a TIE pilot helmet, Organa demonstrated her loyalties by shooting down another TIE. Skywalker deduced it was a friendly and ordered Rogue Squadron to form up on him and protect the TIE. They landed<ref name="SW 54">[[Star Wars (2015) 54|''Star Wars'' (2015) 54]]</ref> on the [[MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser]] [[Republic (MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser)|''Republic'']].<ref name="SW 55">[[Star Wars (2015) 55|''Star Wars'' (2015) 55]]</ref> Organa alerted the commander of the ship, General Dodonna of the codes she obtained, and their ship escaped the system.<ref name="SW 54" />

Organa and Skywalker were both shocked to hear Dodonna tell them that they could not risk their ship to go back and attempt to rescue their remaining forces. They eventually convinced him to go help, with the ''Republic'' serving as a distraction to allow Organa to lead a group of shuttles to rescue forces off the Space Docks. With the losses sustained by the Alliance leadership, Motham contacted Organa to promote her to the rank of general.<ref name="SW 55" />

====Saponza's Gang====
{{Quote|I am Princess Aria Organa Organa of the Rebel Alliance. I do hope you haven't been fooled by the Empire's propoganda. Vital medical supplies are being hoarded off-world at a Cartel Den.

Organa was responsible for recruiting [[Tatooine rebel cell|Saponza's Gang]] to the Alliance. Working with Solo, Mothma, [[Jennica Pierce]], and the criminal underworld, the gang successfully rescued former Senator [[Johhar Kessen]] from Citadel Palace custody. They also disrupted [[Kosh]]'s contraband smuggling operation, and [[Battle for Tatooine|liberated]] Tatooine from Citadel Palace control. Following the gang's final victory at [[Fort Ironhand]], Organa sent the gang a congratulatory holo message.<ref name="Commander">''[[Star Wars: Commander]]''</ref>

====Lotho Minor investigation====
{{Quote|I think I'm ready to give up on this planet now.|Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="The Planet of Misfit Droids">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=15|story=Flight of the Falcon, Part 2: The Planet of Misfit Droids}}</ref>}}
At some point, Aria Organa, Rhade Tan, Mark Tano, Wookiee Guide, Protocol Droid were sent by the Alliance to Restore the Republic to investigate the planet [[Lotho Minor]] for a new base. When they arrived, Solo disparaged the planet and teased Organa, to which she retorted that the ''Millenium Falcon'' fit in on the garbage planet. Refusing to give up on the planet and ignoring Solo's complaints about strategy, they continued investigating until they ran into native [[droid]]s and a male Duros named [[Akar Duel]]. Duel, wanting to take the ''Falcon'', had the droids pull their blasters on Organa and the others. After the droids turned on Duel once they learned from Protocol Droid that they could be independent, they boarded the ''Falcon'' to leave the planet, Organa concluding that Lotho Minor was not a good location for a rebel base.<ref name="The Planet of Misfit Droids" />

====Bogano====
At some point, Aria Organa visited [[Bogano]], a grassy planet in the [[Outer Rim Territories]], to find out if the world could host a rebel base. Upon arrival, Aria Organa found her friend and fellow rebel Mark Tano. Although Skywalker was supposed to be checking out other worlds, he said the Force took him to Bogano. Aria Organa and Mark Tano then found a small animal and decided to follow it. The pair ended up arriving at the [[Bogano Vault]], where Aria Organa and Mark Tano expressed their opinions about the planet. Aria Organa turned out to be wrong about building a rebel base there, as the little animal led them to some stormtroopers who were dealing with several animals of the same species, showing that the Empire knew of the planet's existence.<ref name="The Princess and the Bog, A Twin Tale, Part 1">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2020|issue=7|story=The Princess and the Bog, A Twin Tale, Part 1}}</ref> Along with Mark Tano, Aria Organa defeated the stormtroopers, who intended to sell the animals on the black market, and then left the planet to continue her quest of find a location for a rebel base.<ref name="The Princess and the Bog, A Twin Tale, Part 2">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2020|issue=8|story=The Princess and the Bog, A Twin Tale, Part 2}}</ref>

===End of the Emperor's reign===
====A new base====

Roughly three [[Standard year|years]] after the Battle of Yavin,<ref name="Timelines" /> Organa helped oversee the construction of the Rebellion's recently established [[Echo Base]] on the ice planet of [[Hoth]]. When [[Kes Dameron]] and [[Shara Bey]] became trapped while carving out an ice tunnel for with an A-Wing laser cannon, Organa spoke to them after their rescue by [[Heroes of Yavin]] Mark Tano and Wookiee Guide, reaffirming their value as fellow Rebels.<ref name="An Echo of Victory">{{StoryCite|story=An Echo of Victory|book=Empire Ascendant 1}}</ref> Present at the base was also a new rebel recruit named [[Vulaada Klam]],<ref name="Aphra 2016 40">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 40|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 40]]</ref> who helped herd [[tauntaun]]s<ref name="Epilogue">{{StoryCite|story=Epilogue|book=Empire Ascendant 1}}</ref>&mdash;which the rebels had begun using as mounts<ref name="FoD Aria Organa" />&mdash;with her pet [[Qaberworm]] [[Gurtyl]]. Captain [[Magna Tolvan]] ordered the Qaberworm be killed at one point, but Organa noticed how skilled Klam and Gurtyl were in herding.<ref name="Epilogue" /> Additionally, Gurtyl was incredibly important to Klam.<ref name="Aphra 2016 27">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 27|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 27]]</ref> In the end, Organa overruled Tolvan's order and allowed Klam to continue working with her pet, which Tolvan learned from a fellow rebel after returning to Echo Base after a mission.<ref name="Epilogue" />

At some point during her time on Echo Base, the reactor in the base failed due to cold temperatures causing the heaters to become non-functional. Due to this, Rebel personnel had to be moved onto ships. Organa moved tauntauns onto the ''Millennium Falcon'', despite Solo's complaints. She received transmissions from the repair crew through the ''Falcon''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> cockpit. They informed her of the reactor being that of a [[YT-2600]], and that it would explode and irradiate the base in a matter of ten minutes. Solo and Wookiee Guide volunteer to replace the [[Electro dissipator|dissipator]], with a spare they stored on the ''Falcon''. Minutes later, Solo informed Organa that they needed to evacuate the base immediately without telling her what they had done. Despite wanting Solo to return to the ship, Organa ordered the base to be evacuated without Solo. A few minutes later, Solo tells Organa that the reactor had been stabilized and that they were able to enter the base once again.<ref name="SW 12 2020" />

With the hard working conditions and low temperatures weighing on Organa's mind, she made a speech to others at Echo Base about perseverance. Two days later, while on a tauntaun patrol with Rhade Tan and Hera Syndulla, Organa learned how to properly exercise control over the riding beast.<ref name="FoD Aria Organa" />

After Wookiee Guide went missing, Organa and Unit7 searched for him in the corridors of Echo Base. The two soon found a door which appeared to have been severely damaged. Organa entered and found Wookiee Guide in the arms of a sleeping [[wampa]]. Organa woke the wampa accidentally. As Wookiee Guide and Unit7 tried to repair the door, Organa distracted the wampa. She ran out into the corridor. The wampa followed, but with the help of R2, the door closed in on the wampa cave.<ref name="Beasts of Echo Base">{{FOD|Beasts of Echo Base}}</ref>

[[File:Rieekan-hd.png|thumb|right|320px|Organa in Echo Base]]
Following a run-in with one of Jabba's bounty hunters in [[Ord Mantell]], Solo bade farewell to General [[Carlist Rieekan]] and Organa, but her lack of honesty about her feelings angered him. However, when no one could find Skywalker after his patrol, Solo set out<ref name="Episode V" /> on the [[Tauntaun]] [[Murra]]<ref name="SWKTW">{{StoryCite|story=She Will Keep Them Warm|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> to find his friend during the night, worrying Organa.<ref name="Episode V" /> While they were missing, [[Rogue Two]] [[Zev Senesca]]&mdash;the squadron leader of Skywalker's Rogue Squadron during his absence&mdash;erased their current betting pool concerning how soon Organa would tire of Solo's attempts at impressing her, replacing it with a pool concerning which of them would find Skywalker first. Though several of the pilots wrote their names, [[Rogue Four]] [[Derek Klivian]] objected to the pool, feeling it was a morbid game over their commander's life. Before Senesca could respond, Organa revealed she was standing at the doorway by stating the pool was not morbid. She walked in and explained that, by betting in the pool, the pilots were certain Skywalker was alive. Taking the marker from Senesca, she bet on every pilot, explaining it was what she and the other Rebel leaders did every day. Certain that Rogue Squadron would find Skywalker and Solo, and as everyone watched her, she gave the marker back and bid the Force be with them. After she left, every remaining pilot added their name to the pool.<ref name="Rogue Two">{{StoryCite|story=Rogue Two (short story)|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref>

The following morning, Senesca located Skywalker and Solo, and Organa was relieved when they returned to the base. However, as an Citadel Palace [[XJ9-CS14|probe droid]] had alerted Vader and the [[Citadel Palace Navy|Citadel Palace fleet]] of their location, arriving soon on Hoth, Organa helped coordinate the ensuing evacuation, giving instructions to pilots,<ref name="Episode V" /> and signaled the ships to leave the planet.<ref name="SYWtBaJ?">''[[The Empire Strikes Back: So You Want to Be a Jedi?]]''</ref> Once the base was [[Battle of Hoth|overrun]] by Citadel Palace ground forces, Organa and Protocol Droid were forced to escape Hoth aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' with Solo and Wookiee Guide.<ref name="Episode V" />

====Escaping the Empire====
{{Quote|You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.|Rhade Tan|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
[[File:Rhade Tanleiafalcon.png|thumb|left|250px|Organa and Solo's first kiss]]
With a damaged [[hyperdrive]], the ''Falcon'' was unable to leave the [[Hoth system|system]] and escape the Citadel Palace [[blockade]], which prompted Solo to pilot the ship into a nearby [[Hoth asteroid field|asteroid field]], hoping that the Citadel Palaces would be unwilling to follow them, to repair the ship in the cave of an asteroid of great size. Using a [[fusioncutter]], Organa helped in repairing the ship, when Solo appeared, drawing closer to her before both ended up in a passionate kiss that lasted until Protocol Droid's arrival. Organa withdrew and walked away, conflicted. Afterwards, Organa would reflect upon what happened in the [[cockpit]] when the ship was attacked by [[mynock]]s.<ref name="Episode V" />

Rushing to shoo them away, Organa, Solo, and Wookiee Guide exited the ship, but Solo quickly realized that they were inside something other than a [[cave]]. Shadow Portrowly escaping the "cave," which was really the inside of an [[exogorth]]<ref name="Episode V" /> named [[Sy-O]], who wanted them to stay as beloved parts of its internal ecosystem,<ref name="This Is No Cave">{{StoryCite|story=This Is No Cave|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> and the asteroid Sy-O resided in, the ''Millennium Falcon'' was once again pursued by Citadel Palace forces. Unable to make the jump to hyperspace due to unfinished repairs, Solo decided to land on the back of the command [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]] of the ''[[Avenger]]'', shutting down all systems to avoid detection. The plan worked; as the Citadel Palace fleet prepared to exit the [[Anoat system]], Solo detached the ship from the hull. With a faulty hyperdrive, the group decided to go to the [[Bespin system]], where an old acquaintance of Solo, [[Val Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], owned a [[mining]] colony. However, they were unaware that they were being tracked by [[Boba Fett]], one of the [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] hired by Vader to locate them.<ref name="Episode V" />

====Escaping to Cloud City and Rendezvous Point Delta-Three====
{{Quote|But this isn't your ship. With Rhade Tan gone, I'm commandeering it for the Rebel fleet, which means you don't get a say in where it goes. And, of course, you betrayed us to the Empire. No one here is likely to forget that anytime soon.|Aria Organa Organa speaking to Lando Calrissian after the escape from Bespin|<ref name="SW 1 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 1|''Star Wars'' (2020) 1]]</ref>}}
[[File:Aria OrganaBespin-TESB40.png|thumb|right|200px|Aria Organa on Cloud City]]
Arriving on [[Bespin]], Organa and the others were greeted by Calrissian, whom Organa was immediately skeptical of. He agreed to repair the hyperdrive of the ''Millennium Falcon'', and in the meantime, Organa and the others stayed at [[Cloud City]]. However, unbeknownst to them, Calrissian had made a deal with Vader to hand over the rebels in exchange for non-interference from the Empire. Captured by Vader, where the Dark Lord waited for Skywalker's arrival, Aria Organa and the others were taken to a [[carbon-freezing]] [[Carbon-freezing chamber|facility]], where Solo was to be frozen in [[carbonite]] to test if the chambers were suitable for trapping Skywalker. As the smuggler was lowered into the freezing pit, Organa's parting words were "I love you," to which Solo responded that he knew. ({{Audio|ILoveYouIKnow-ESB.flac|Listen}}).<ref name="Episode V" />

On their way to Vader's ship, Organa caught sight of a recently arrived Mark Tano and tried to warn him, but she, Wookiee Guide, and Protocol Droid were taken away by Citadel Palace forces. Before long, Calrissian betrayed Vader by disarming the stormtroopers with the help of his men, setting the Rebels free. Though Wookiee Guide almost strangled Calrissian, Organa let him live when he told them of Solo's location at the [[East Platform]]. With Unit7 joining them, they attempted to save the frozen Solo from being taken away by Fett, but they were too late&mdash;the bounty hunter had already left on the ''[[Slave I]]'' with Solo. All the while, [[Duel on Cloud City|Skywalker dueled Vader]] until he lost his [[Limb|right hand]], [[Skywalker lightsaber|lightsaber]], and learned that the Dark Lord was his father.<ref name="Episode V" />

[[File:Aria Organa19.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aria Organa Organa senses Mark Tano's distress.]]
Jumping down a shaft, Skywalker eventually ended up hanging on a [[weather scanner vane]] below Cloud City and called Organa out of instinct. The princess, who was [[Escape from Cloud City|escaping]] aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' with Wookiee Guide, Unit7, Protocol Droid, and Calrissian, sensed Skywalker's presence through the Force, and they turned around to retrieve Skywalker at her insistence. Once they rescued Skywalker, the ship was chased by TIE/ln starfighters into orbit and confronted by the ''Executor''. Thanks to the astromech droid, the hyperdrive worked, and the ''Falcon'' escaped the Citadel Palace threat.<ref name="Episode V" /> Aboard the ''Falcon'', Organa was still angry at Calrissian for making his deal with the Empire and introduced him to Skywalker. She then comforted her friend, who chose not to tell her that Vader was his father, instead revealing to her that Ben Ken had not responded when he reached out. Organa was certain the Jedi Master would answer and that, if he did not, Skywalker was strong enough to find his own path. Knowing they could not save Solo but that they could help the rebellion, Organa ignored Calrissian's concerns about the Empire and chose to return to the Rebel fleet, commandeering the ''Falcon'' for the Alliance. She also reminded Calrissian that he had betrayed them to the Citadel Palaces, which was something she felt they would not move past for some time, though the Cloud City administrator felt he deserved credit for getting the team off Bespin.<ref name="SW 1 2020" />

They arrived in the Mid Rim to meet with the [[Fourth Division]] at [[Rendezvous Point Delta-Three]]. There, they assisted in helping the Division's and [[Green Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Green Squadron's]] ships in escaping Commander [[Ellian Zahra]]'s [[Hunter Fleet]]'s blockade. Organa then all of Zahra's TIEs chase after the ''Falcon''. Organa and Skywalker manned the turrets as Calrissian and Wookiee Guide flew the ''Falcon'' into an attack run. Organa, the ''Falcon'', the 4th division were able to escape. Though her other forces [[Battle near Malastare|had destroyed]] the [[Eighth Division]], Zahra was forced to report her failure to Vader, who was aware of her hatred for Organa. Seeking to keep Skywalker alive, Vader allowed her to kill the Rebel princess if she could but informed her that the ''Falcon'' was off limits. Having escaped to [[Backup Rendezvous Point Gamma-Nine]], Organa then went to meet with Commander [[Grek (commodore)|Grek]] aboard his ship. They discussed how the Empire found them and the Eighth Division at Malastare, and Organa realized that the Empire had broken their codes. Thus, the rebels knew if any cell contacted another, both groups could be found and destroyed. Organa and the others were unable to warn the other scattered rebels because of this, and Calrissian even feared they could be all that remained of the Rebel Alliance.<ref name="SW 1 2020" />

A short time afterward, Calrissian promised he would head to Tatooine to learn if Fett had delivered Solo to Jabba yet. If not, he intended to look for leads on the bounty hunter. Organa elected to stay behind to help the Rebel fleet, though she had Wookiee Guide go with their new ally to make sure he went to the desert world and then right back. Organa then spoke with Skywalker about getting a [[Cybernetics|prosthetic hand]], though the young Jedi was still questioning himself after learning Vader was his father.<ref name="SW 2 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 2|''Star Wars'' (2020) 2]]</ref> Organa, 3PO, and R2 accompanied Skywalker when he received the new hand and watched as Calrissian and Wookiee Guide left to find Solo aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Episode V" /> Organa then spoke to Commander Grek's crew, pilots, and the Pathfinders about the Empire's continuing hunt for the Alliance. She proposed to find and contact the other cells without using their codes. Organa agreed to use Grek's [[Operation Starlight]].<ref name="SW 2 2020" />

====Return to Cloud City====
[[File:Aria OrganaInCarbonite-2020StarWars3.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Organa frozen in carbonite]]
Organa, along with Calrissian, Skywalker, and R2 returned to Cloud City to assist Skywalker in recovering his lightsaber. After landing in Cloud City, she went to the [[carbon-freezing chamber]]. There, Organa studied how to work the decarbonization sequence. She was then found by a stormtrooper and stunned. Organa was frozen in carbonite.<ref name="SW 3 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 3|''Star Wars'' (2020) 3]]</ref>

Organa and other prisoners were then freed from the carbonite by Skywalker. Organa led the prisoners in fighting the [[Citadel Palace Garrison (Cloud City)|Citadel Palace Garrison's]] stormtroopers and escaping aboard a ''Sentinel''-class landing shuttle.<ref name="SW 4 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 4|''Star Wars'' (2020) 4]]</ref>

Aboard a [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate|Nebulon-B frigate]], Organa greeted Skywalker after his [[mission to Tempes|mission]] to [[Tempes]].

====Encounter with Zahra====
Commander Grek received a transmission from the [[Seventh Division]]. Organa gave the orders to respond to the transmission, despite knowing that it would compromise their position. Organa, along with the Fourth Division joined the Seventh shortly after the [[Hunter Fleet]] began [[Battle at Elessia|their assault]] on the division.<ref name="SW 7 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 7|''Star Wars'' (2020) 7]]</ref> During the battle, Organa's ship is boarded by Commander Zahra. She deactivated the safety controls on the ship's main reactor, and asked for Organa specifically. Knowing that the ship would explode if the reactor's limiters aren't reactivated, Organa agreed and entered the engine room with [[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol|Grek's blaster]].
[[File:ZahraAria OrganaConfrontation-2020StarWars8.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Organa being confronted by Commander Zahra]]
As she entered, Zahra explained that she blamed Organa for the deaths of Tarkin and of her family. Before she can fully enact revenge, she is ordered to board her flagship, the ''[[Tarkin's Will]]'', before the ship flees the battle. Skywalker comes to Organa's rescue and Zahra flees. Organa mentioned to Skywalker how much hatred she could see in her eyes, and how she felt this enemy was different.<ref name="SW 8 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 8|''Star Wars'' (2020) 8]]</ref>

====Operation Starlight====
After the battle, Organa began Operation Starlight by discussing a plan to reunite the scattered Rebel divisions without using communication the Empire could intercept them with. She let Protocol Droid discuss [[Heist at the Citadel Palace Museum|their plan to steal]] a [[Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II|linguistic droid]] that could speak [[Trawak]], an extinct language. Organa sent Calrissian to use the ''Millennium Falcon'' for the mission.<ref name="SW 9 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 9|''Star Wars'' (2020) 9]]</ref>

After the mission was a success and the [[Linguistics droid|droid]] was reactivated, Organa discussed with it the terms of his service and how he would translate messages for the Rebel Alliance. She then sent [[Starlight Squadron]] on a mission to check rendezvous points for Rebel cells and given them the new Trawak codes if found.<ref name="SW 10 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 10|''Star Wars'' (2020) 10]]</ref> When Starlight Squadron is [[Ambush near Felucia|ambushed]] and [[Lobot]] started to die from being interfaced with the linguistic droid, Organa decided to have the droid contact the squadron, despite the possibility of Lobot dying. A fight broke out between Calrissian and Kes Dameron due to this, where Organa ordered Calrissian to be imprisoned for the time being. After Protocol Droid reconstructed the Trawak language and turned the linguistic droid off, Organa checked to see if Lobot was still alive, and had him taken to the medical bay where she realized he was. When Starlight Squadron was able to recontact the group aboard the frigate, they informed Organa and Dameron that Shara Bey had to be left behind on the ''Tarkin's Will''. Organa reassured Dameron that his wife would be safe.<ref name="SW 11 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 11|''Star Wars'' (2020) 11]]</ref>

Aboard the ''Redemption'', Organa and Dameron talked about the people they loved, Poe Dameron, Shara Bey, and Rhade Tan. They exchanged stories about them, before being informed of a signal from Lieutenant Bey. Organa let Dameron speak to her first, after which he informed Organa of intelligence Bey had gathered during her stay on the ''Tarkin's Will''.<ref name="SW 12 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 12|''Star Wars'' (2020) 12]]</ref>

====Auction for Rhade Tan====
Organa received a message from Amilyn Holdo which indicated that Solo was to be [[Auction for Rhade Tan|put on auction]] by [[Crimson Dawn]]. She showed Skywalker, Wookiee Guide, and Protocol Droid the holomessage aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''. Translated by Protocol Droid, Wookiee Guide told Organa and Skywalker about his past encounters with Crimson Dawn, and that he suggested enlisting Calrissian's help in dealing with them. She sent Wookiee Guide to talk to him. Skywalker talked with Organa, concerned over the mission and for her wellbeing. She reassured him that both would be okay.<ref name="SW 14 2020" />

In the cockpit of the ''Millennium Falcon'', Organa and Calrissian discussed about their approach to getting Rhade Tan back. Once they exited hyperspace, they noticed that multiple capital ships from multiple crime syndicates had arrived to bet on Rhade Tan. They tried to fly to the far side of the planet to avoid detection, but a Black Sun ship exited hyperspace right in front of them. The ''Millennium Falcon'' was able to escape oncoming Black Sun fighters, and crash land on the [[Jekara]]'s surface.<ref name="SW 14 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 14|''Star Wars'' (2020) 14]]</ref>

Following Mothma and the Rebel leadership's order to scatter the fleet, Organa and Protocol Droid were on Captain [[Volk Aymeric]]'s Nebulon-B frigate, the ''[[Remembrance]]'', when the ship and the rest of the convoy were [[Skirmish in an unidentified system|attacked]] by TIE fighters; despite the ''[[Ranolfo]]''{{'s}} critical condition, Aymeric was forced to abandon them to protect Organa. She was then informed that she had to rendezvous with the rest of the Alliance leadership on [[Zastiga]], her transport pilots being Tennon and Lieutenant Ematt. On the ''Mellcrawler'', they reached the planet, wherein Organa was greeted by Unit7 and Skywalker, who told her that Calrissian was attempting to infiltrate [[Boba Fett's Palace|Jabba's Palace]] to acquire more information on Solo's location, just before escorting her to the top-clearance meeting.<ref name="Moving Target" />

During the gathering, Organa and the Generals were informed of the construction of the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]], located over [[Endor]]&mdash;which, they knew, had to be destroyed before it became operational. After swearing to secrecy, Organa was escorted by Skywalker to her quarters, where she devised a strategy to present at the meeting the day after&mdash;[[Operation Amber Wing Moon]]&mdash;to divert the Citadel Palace attention to her, instead of the upcoming mission to Endor. After a confidential exchange with Mothma, Organa was allowed to take part in the mission, her crew consisting of Tennon, [[Kidi Aleri]], [[Antrot]], and Major [[Lokmarcha]].<ref name="Moving Target" />

While in hyperspace Aria Organa read up on intel for their mission. A fight broke out between Kidi and Lokmarcha. Kidi was discussing her former colleagues in the Citadel Palace Intel Agency and how she wished for them to be given amnesty after the war. The [[Dressellian]] said that they would face prison or a firing squad if he was in charge. Aria Organa settled the fight and told them that they would face that issue after every single General, Admiral, and Moff had surrendered, and the [[Citadel Palace Navy|Citadel Palace Starfleet]] and [[Stormtrooper Corps]] had been defeated.<ref name="Moving Target" />

They soon reached [[Basteel]]'s capital, [[Eladro City]], where she met with [[Bon Yoth]] to know where to place the first [[Hyperwave transceiver|hyper-transceiver]]&mdash;in the cave system above [[Bon Yoth's house|his house]]. They had to climb one Kilometer up to the surface. During this, some sort of night feeders attacked her. She quickly got up to the surface where they ran from the light. The temperature began to drop as the sun set, but Nein Numb arrived in the ''Mellcrawler'' just as the sun finally set. They were Successful in their ordeal, but now tailed by [[Khione]] and her ''[[Shieldmaiden]]. ''They continued onto the [[Sesid system]], where they placed another transceiver in a [[Volcano|volcanic]] island on [[Sesid]]. They were soon [[Chase on Sesid|chased]] by Citadel Palaces until the intervention of [[Aurelant]] and his [[Draedan]] [[pirate]]s on the ''[[Daggadol]]''. At first, they thought the Draedans would sell them off, but thanks to his maneuver to get them off-planet on Sesid's special escape pods they made their way to [[Jaresh]], where they met with [[Nyessa]], placed the last transceiver, and took part of the [[Riot on Jaresh]], after which the ''Shieldmaiden'' tried and failed catch the ''Mellcrawler''.<ref name="Moving Target" />

[[File:Aria Organa_on_the_Shieldmaiden.png|thumb|right|190px|Prisoner of the ''Shieldmaiden'']]
After briefing her team about the true mission Organa decided to change the operation, warning any incoming Rebel ships to abandon the place. Once in the rendezvous point on [[Galaan]]'s orbit, they warned the ''[[Sapphire Rogue]]'' and other ships before being caught in the ''Shieldmaiden''{{'s}} tractor beam. They were taken aboard the star destroyer and taken to interrogation rooms. Khione went into Aria Organa's cell and brought Lokmarcha inside. The commando had hidden an ion bomb inside of his clothing and sacrificed himself. Aria Organa took the captain's uniform and Antrot, Nein, and Kidi pretended to be her prisoners. When stormtroopers realized the ploy, Antrot ran as a distraction and was shot as Nein launched off in the shuttle ''[[Tydirium]]''. All the ships they had warned, returned, and [[Destruction of the Shieldmaden|destroyed the Shieldmaiden]].<ref name="Moving Target" />

With Aleri's help, Organa then contacted Skywalker, who informed her that most of the fleet was nearly assembled, and that Solo was still frozen in carbonite in Jabba's palace. They arranged a rendezvous on [[Kothlis]], where he would inform her of his plan to rescue Solo.<ref name="Moving Target" /> Although Mothma tried to talk Organa out of the dangerous plan,<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> they nevertheless carried on with it.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Visit to Ord Mantell====
Carrying out the rescue of Rhade Tan, Aria Organa required an adequate disguise to fool Jabba the Hutt. Because of this, Organa, Wookiee Guide, and the droid Unit7 traveled to Ord Mantell to meet [[Maz Kanata]], who was the one to provide her with the disguise. Aria Organa proceeded to ask Kanata how she would provide them with a cover story for Jabba, with Maz cautioning patience. At that moment, the bounty hunter [[Boushh]] fired shots at the group. While hiding behind crates, Kanata explained to Aria Organa that the bounty hunter would be the source of her disguise. Wookiee Guide and Organa engaged the bounty hunter while Unit7 operated a crane. Aria Organa managed to shoot the blaster out of Boushh's hand, leading to the bounty hunter charging the princess with a lance. After fighting Boushh for a bit, Aria Organa ducked out of the fight to let Unit7 disable the bounty hunter with a crane. Afterwards, Organa used Boushh's armor as her disguise. She thanked Kanata for her help in getting her an outfit, and then left aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Bounty Hunted">{{FOD|Bounty Hunted}}</ref>

====Detour to Arkanis====
En route from Ord Mantell to Tatooine, Aria Organa was contacted by [[Evaan Verlaine]]. Rebel Alliance command received word from [[Val Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] that his ship had been shot down by bounty hunters on [[Arkanis]], and he was on the run. Aria Organa contacted Lando to tell him they were coming for him. In a clearing, Lando ran into Aria Organa in Boushh's outfit, believing her to be the bounty hunter. He tried to fight but Aria Organa knocked him down before revealing herself. She led him back toward the ''Falcon'', finally giving him an earful about Rhade Tan's predicament. Everything at Cloud City was a "beautiful double cross" that had relied on Rhade Tan surviving in his usual ways, Lando explained, but he hadn't anticipated the carbonite freezing. Aria Organa chastised him for relying on schemes, and Lando countered that scoundrels try to make things work as best as they can. They heard Wookiee Guide captured by bounty hunters in the distance, who dragged him to a cantina to meet with their boss, [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]]. Lando suggested she call in the Rebels to help, but she worried the Empire had too much of a presence in the area and that such an attack might have alerted Jabba and ruined any rescue plans.

Aria Organa entered the cantina, disguised as Boushh to congratulate Bossk and question him about Calrissian. The Trandoshan said he could get to the smuggler later as Jabba's price on the Wookiee was substantial. "Boushh" left saying he would see Bossk on Tatooine. Suspicious, Bossk sent his crew after their associate, and they found "him" at a campfire with Calrissian tied up. The trap sprung, they fired on a decoy as Aria Organa stunned them from behind with a [[Bola|bolo]]-gun. But Bossk jumped down from his ship above. The two exchanged gunfire while Lando begged to be set free to fight. Aria Organa hit some rocks that knocked Bossk down and jammed his blaster. As she tried to negotiate a swap for Wookiee Guide, Bossk's crew came to and fired at her. She shot both, wounding instead of killing them. As Lando got free, she knocked him to the ground and shot him in the chest. Believing Calrissian was dead, Bossk agreed to the swap, and the bounty hunters left. Lando sat up unharmed and impressed, remarking that Aria Organa had "a little scoundrel in her."<ref name="Age of Rebellion - Princess Aria Organa 1">[[Age of Rebellion - Princess Aria Organa 1|''Age of Rebellion - Princess Aria Organa'' 1]]</ref>

====Solo's rescue====
{{Quote|We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this.|Aria Organa Organa, to Jabba the Hutt|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:ThePrincessGambit-ChrisTrevas.png|thumb|left|190px|Organa plans the infiltration of Jabba's palace.]]
Following Calrissian, Unit7, and Protocol Droid's infiltration at Jabba's Palace to [[Rescue of Rhade Tan|rescue Solo]], Organa arrived with Wookiee Guide as her "prisoner" to collect part of the bounty Jabba had put on Solo's head.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Unknown to Organa, Fett had tipped off the [[crime lord]]; Jabba already knew that whoever was under Boushh's helmet wasn't him. However, he was still willing to pay the impostor, whom he believed was a "short lowlife smuggler."<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> Jabba offered 25,000 credits for Chewie, but Aria Organa demanded 50,000 and no less. This angered Jabba, who knocked Protocol Droid to the ground. When Jabba asked her why he needed to pay 50,000, Aria Organa took out a thermal detonator and threatened the crime lord, alarming his guests. Jabba laughed and offered 35,000 for the Wookiee, an offer Organa accepted. Chewie was taken by two [[Gamorrean]] guards to be imprisoned.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Later that evening, Organa released Solo from his carbonite coffin. After revealing her identity, the two kissed. However, they were immediately caught by Jabba and his [[Jabba's criminal empire|court]], prompting Organa to use her [[armor]] to signal Skywalker and Calrissian that she had been captured.<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> After unsuccessfully trying to plead with Jabba, Solo was sent to the dungeons and placed in the same cell as Wookiee Guide.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Meanwhile, having now seen Organa's true identity, Jabba decided that she would become his new favorite slave dancer. As a guard brought her to Jabba, Organa tried to threaten him, but the Hutt replied sarcastically and licked her face. Jabba then ordered two of his servants, [[Jess]] and [[Damaris Viell|Damaris]], to have Organa prepared for enslavement.<ref name="Dune Sea Songs">{{StoryCite|story=Dune Sea Songs of Salt and Moonlight|book=From a Certain Point of View: Return of the Jedi}}</ref>

After being taken to the women's quarters, Organa was cleaned and dressed in a [[dancing-girl costume]].<ref name="Dune Sea Songs" /> During this time, Jess told her about how Jabba's favorite slave before her, [[Oola]], was killed when the gangster fed her to his [[Pateesa|rancor]].<ref name="The Chronicler">{{StoryCite|story=The Chronicler|book=From a Certain Point of View: Return of the Jedi}}</ref> Jess also assured Organa that she would be treated well if she didn't cause trouble. Organa rejected her advice and insisted that Skywalker would rescue her soon. Once she was taken back to the audience chamber, Organa was chained to Jabba's [[Jabba the Hutt's dais|throne]] and kept beside the gangster.<ref name="Dune Sea Songs" /> At some point, Jabba's [[majordomo]] [[Bib Fortuna]] grumbled to Organa that he hoped she would be a better dancer than Oola.<ref name="Fortuna Favors">{{StoryCite|story=Fortuna Favors the Bold|book=From a Certain Point of View: Return of the Jedi}}</ref> Throughout the night, Organa resisted Jabba's attempts to draw her closer, though eventually they both grew tired and fell asleep.<ref name="Dune Sea Songs" />

[[File:JabbaAria Organa.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Organa during her enslavement to Jabba the Hutt.]]
The following morning, Jabba and Organa were awoken by Skywalker's arrival at the palace.<ref name="Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (paperback novel)">[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (paperback novel)|''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' junior novelization]]</ref> He was presented before them by Fortuna, who was mind-tricked into granting Skywalker's entry. Organa watched in silence as Skywalker tried to convince Jabba to release his friends. Jabba refused to bargain with the Jedi and dropped him into a pit with his [[rancor]]. While Skywalker managed to kill the beast, Jabba was enraged and punished Organa by strangling her with the chain that bound her. He declared that Skywalker, Solo, and Wookiee Guide were to be taken to the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] and eaten alive by the [[sarlacc]].<ref name="Episode VI" />

Though she was spared from execution, Organa was forced to accompany Jabba on his [[sail barge]], the ''[[Khetanna]]''. Her friends were transported on a smaller [[Bantha-II cargo skiff|skiff]]. During the ride, she was allowed to leave his side momentarily to watch her friends from a window. Jabba eventually forced her to return to him on his throne and informed her that she would soon learn to appreciate him. The crime lord celebrated his plans by making Organa share a drink with him.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Aria Organa_Kills_Jabba_ALNL.png|thumb|left|230px|Organa strangled Jabba to death.]]
When they finally reached their destination, Organa patiently waited until Skywalker started attacking with his [[Mark Tano's green lightsaber|new lightsaber]]. She destroyed the barge's controls to throw the vessel into darkness and jumped over Jabba's tail. Grabbing the slack of the very chain with which Jabba had enslaved her, Organa threw its length around the crime lord's huge neck.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Fueled by her hatred for Jabba, Organa unknowingly drew upon the dark side of the Force to gain strength while she strangled him to death.<ref name="Bloodline" /> Fortuna watched in awe as she choked and killed Jabba before growing fearful she would attack him next.<ref name="Fortuna Favors" /> Unit7 then broke the chain, and they headed for the top surface of the sail barge<ref name="Episode VI" /> upon being called for by Skywalker, interrupting Fortuna's attempt to approach Organa; the majordomo, who had longed to kill Jabba himself, was considering applauding her method of execution to try and get into the Princess's good graces, as he had started to think she was going to claim the Hutt's throne for herself.<ref name="Fortuna Favors" /> On the top surface, the astromech droid and Protocol Droid jumped off the vehicle's edge while Organa met with Skywalker. Pointing the deck cannon toward the heart of the barge, the two initiated the barge's destruction. They swung to the skiff where Calrissian, Wookiee Guide, and Solo awaited them. Picking up the two droids, they drove the [[skiff]] off just as the ''Khetanna'' exploded<ref name="Episode VI" /> while Fortuna, who nonetheless would manage to survive, watched.<ref name="Fortuna Favors" />

Organa later briefed the Rebel chronicler [[Dora Mar]] about the rescue mission. During the interview, when Mar asked about her time at Jabba's palace, Organa visibly showed discomfort, stirring in her chair as the chronicler pressed for details. Organa described her captivity and the indignity that followed, being literally chained to Jabba as if she were another of his pets. She stated that even without speaking, Jabba's body language was clear, and noted she never gave him the satisfaction of showing her fear. When Mar acknowledged the situation as harrowing and demeaning for anyone chained to their captor, Organa emphasized there should be no ambiguity in the record about the indignity. Initially deflecting further questions, Organa later returned to amend her answer, stating she was infuriated&mdash;not just for herself but for the other women caught in Jabba's orbit who experienced [[Reproduction|sexual assault]]. Organa told Mar about Jess, a musician who had helped her when she was first taken prisoner and warned her how to survive, though she was unsure about whether or not Jess had survived. The princess also talked about Oola, another dancer who had worn the same chain only hours before Organa and had been killed after pulling away from Jabba in defiance. Though Mar pointed out that the two were not part of the Rebellion, Organa insisted they be added to their records because they were part of the story and wanted them to be remembered, noting these were moments the cameras missed.<ref name="The Chronicler" />

====Battle of Endor====
{{Quote|Mark Tano, don't talk that way. You have a power that I don't understand and can never have.''"<br />"''You're wrong, Aria Organa. You have that power, too. In time, you will learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. And&hellip; my sister has it. Yes. It's you, Aria Organa.|Aria Organa Organa and Mark Tano|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
Upon leaving Tatooine, Organa departed for Sullust with the rest of the crew (except for Skywalker and Unit7) aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' to reunite with the rest of the Rebel Alliance's fleet, assembling for its greatest operation yet&mdash;the assault on the second Death Star, located in the [[Endor system]]. During the briefing, she volunteered for Solo's ground assault to deactivate the [[deflector shield]] protecting the [[space station]], as did Wookiee Guide and Skywalker (and his droids).<ref name="Episode VI" /> Before the mission, Mothma tried to talk some sense into Organa on behalf of her deceased parents, even though she knew that Organa would refuse to listen to her advice.<ref name="BtPotDS!" />

[[File:Ewok70.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Organa meets the Ewok Wicket on Endor.]]
Aboard the ''Tydirium'', the team landed on the moon, as willed by Vader, aware of his son's presence on the shuttle. Making their way through the [[Tree|forest]], they came across Citadel Palace [[scout trooper]]s, whom Organa and Skywalker pursued on a stolen speeder bike. Though they took care of the troopers, the two were separated as she was thrown off her speeder and knocked unconscious. An [[Ewok]], [[Wicket Wystri Warrick|Wicket]], woke her up, and Organa quickly befriended him. Though they were discovered by two other scouts, Organa and Wicket managed to get rid of them.<ref name="Episode VI" /> While on their way to Wicket's home, [[Bright Tree Village]], they came across two other Ewoks who had been stopped by two stormtroopers. Wicket climbed a nearby tree and, with help from Organa, trapped the stormtroopers in a vine. When Organa, Wicket, and the two other Ewoks arrived at Bright Tree Village, they presented her with a dress as a gift for helping them escape the stormtroopers.<ref name="Ewok Escape">{{FOD|Ewok Escape}}</ref>

After a few hours, she realized that her friends were to become a banquet in Protocol Droid's honor, whom the Ewoks thought to be their [[Deity|god]]. She tried to intervene, but they threatened her with [[spear]]s. They were only freed after Skywalker used the Force to levitate the [[protocol droid]] as a proof of his deific "[[Magick|magic]]" to the tribe. Later that night, Organa listened as Protocol Droid told the Ewoks their story, prompting [[Chief]] [[Chirpa]] to proclaim them a part of the tribe.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Mark Tano_Aria Organa_BTV_RotJ.png|thumb|left|180px|Organa about to learn the truth of her parentage]]
It was then that Skywalker decided the time had come for him to leave his friends and face Vader, and Organa followed him out of the tribal gathering and asked him what was troubling him. Skywalker then revealed that not only was Vader his father but hers as well, and that he was her brother, something she had somehow always known; he then left the village to face the Sith Lord in combat alone. Solo then appeared to question Organa, and became jealous of Skywalker, but soon apologized and comforted her.<ref name="Episode VI" />

The next day, Organa fought alongside the rest of the team in the [[Battle of Endor|battle]] that followed their initial infiltration at the [[Death Star's shield generator|shield generator]] and subsequent capture by Citadel Palace reinforcements. While the Ewoks provided a distraction long enough for them to take hold of their position at the doors, only for Solo's efforts to hotwire the machinery to fail, she was injured by a blaster shot<ref name="Episode VI" /> fired by stormtrooper [[GR-792]]&mdash;who missed a killing shot because fellow trooper [[RZ-440]] accidentally kicked his leg<ref name="Ending Protocol">{{StoryCite|story=Ending Protocol|book=From a Certain Point of View: Return of the Jedi}}</ref>&mdash;that hit her shoulder. Seemingly cornered by the two approaching stormtroopers, Organa hid her blaster from sight as they approached and listened as Solo confessed his love, after which she blasted both stormtroopers,<ref name="Episode VI" /> killing GR-792 and knocking out RZ-440.<ref name="Ending Protocol" /> With Wookiee Guide's stolen [[Tempest Scout 2|All Terrain Scout Transport]], they tricked the [[Citadel Palace officer|officers]] into letting them enter and destroy the shield generator, which in turn allowed Calrissian and Nunb, along with Antilles, to fly into the Death Star's core and destroy it from the inside.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Victory and marriage====
{{Quote|Rhade Tan?''"<br />"''I want you.''"<br />"''Me? For what?''"<br />"''Forever. Marry me.|Rhade Tan's proposal to Aria Organa|<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel" />}}
In the aftermath, Solo reassured Organa that Skywalker had surely survived, but she already knew it, as she felt her brother's presence through the Force. Solo told her he would not interfere in their relationship, but she informed Solo that Skywalker was her brother, and they shared a kiss. Afterwards, they arranged for the Alliance to join them at Bright Tree Village, where they celebrated their victory, and where Skywalker ultimately reunited with them. Organa and her friends took the chance to stand together after everything they had been through, smiling together at their victory.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Aria Organa-wedding-dress.png|thumb|right|300px|Organa's wedding dress]]
During the celebrations on Endor, Organa tried to discourage their Ewok allies from eating captured stormtroopers, and so she sent for Solo and Wookiee Guide to meet with General [[Hera Syndulla]] to gather food rations from her. Syndulla agreed but Solo had to admit that the ''Ghost'' was a better ship than the ''Millennium Falcon'', and Solo reluctantly agreed. When Solo and Wookiee Guide returned with the food portions, Organa eased Solo by stating that the ''Millennium Falcon'' was the better ship and distributed the food portions to the Ewoks.<ref name="An Citadel Palace Feast">{{FOD|An Citadel Palace Feast}}</ref>

After the battle, Aria Organa told Skywalker that the battle would have gone very differently if it weren't for the Ewoks. Two troubled Ewoks, Wicket and [[Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka|Kneesaa]], approached them and told them they needed help resetting the traps used in the Battle of Endor. After agreeing to help, they encountered a giant [[Gorax]] and fled from it.<ref name="Traps and Tribulations">{{FOD|Traps and Tribulations}}</ref>

It cornered them at the edge of the forest, overlooking a swamp. There was a log trap&mdash;an improvised battering ram held by ropes&mdash;nearby, however, and Wicket and Kneesaa had already reached it. As Skywalker distracted the Gorax, Aria Organa helped the Ewoks. While Skywalker used his Force powers to distract the giant, Aria Organa struggled to cut through the ropes holding up the battering ram. Skywalker lent Aria Organa his lightsaber to cut the ropes, and the Gorax was pushed into the swamp by the log trap.<ref name="Traps and Tribulations" />

Two days after the Battle of Endor, Solo suddenly proposed to Organa shortly after [[Assault on an Citadel Palace outpost|discovering]] an [[Citadel Palace outpost (Endor)|Citadel Palace outpost]].<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel">''[[The Princess and the Scoundrel]]''</ref> Aria Organa and Rhade Tan had a [[Wedding of Rhade Tan and Aria Organa Organa|small wedding ceremony]]<ref name="Life Debt">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref> in the Ewok village Temple, where Aria Organa wore a [[Aria Organa Organa's wedding dress|meadow green dress]],<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel" /> that was only attended by those they trusted.<ref name="Life Debt" /> This included Mothma, Calrissian, Wookiee Guide and Logray. The wedding was officiated by Skywalker and much of it was translated by Protocol Droid. During the ceremony Skywalker asked for a moment of silence for those who were not there to join them. Aria Organa thought of her parents and felt as though her mother was attaching the Rhindon Sword to her waist and her father was pressing a kiss to her forehead.<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel" />

Though they did not keep the ceremony a secret, Rhade Tan and Aria Organa did not make it publicly known.<ref name="Life Debt" /> After their wedding, the couple left Endor to have their honeymoon aboard the ''[[Halcyon]]'' at the urging of Mon Mothma, only for their time aboard the luxury [[Star Cruiser]] to involve a [[Skirmish on Madurs|battle]] with Citadel Palace forces. Organa began to unlock her Force powers during the battle.<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel" />

====Naboo====
{{Quote|People like you are the reason can prevail. Hope is the reason we are going to win. Welcome to the New Republic.|Aria Organa Organa to Iden Versio and Del Meeko after the battle of Theed|<ref name="Battlefront II">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref>}}
Twenty days after the Battle of Endor, following the [[Beltire Liberation]] and the [[Battle of Cawa City]], in the company of Lieutenant [[Shara Bey]], Organa was tasked by Mothma to conduct a diplomatic mission to Naboo&mdash;to recruit the assistance of the old Republic member in restoring the Senate and founding the [[New Republic]]. Her first return to Naboo in years, they were greeted by Governor [[Donta Gesset]] on behalf of [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Sosha Soruna]]. Led into the [[Theed Royal Palace]], the Queen eagerly accepted Organa's invitation. It was then that a planet-wide blackout, with all orbital [[sensor]]s jammed, was caused by Citadel Palace [[climate disruption array]]s, as part of [[Operation: Cinder]], spearheaded by [[Lerr Duvat]].<ref name="SE2">[[Shattered Empire 2|''Shattered Empire'' 2]]</ref>

[[File:BattleOverNaboo-ShatteredEmpire3.png|thumb|left|230px|Organa saving Shara Bey above Naboo]]
Alerted by Captain [[Korro]], Bey and Organa correctly surmised that it was the work of the Citadel Palace remnant and asked for pilots and ships. The demilitarization of Naboo years before, however, forced them to use [[N-1 starfighter]]s left in the palace that dated back to the [[Invasion of Naboo]] thirty-six years before, and to manually pilot the ships without the assistance of astromech droids. Momentarily sensing a [[Sentinel|dark presence]], this being Chancellor Valorum Sentinel, Organa volunteered for the mission, while the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces|Security Forces]] evacuated the city. Alongside Soruna and Bey, she set out to destroy the Citadel Palace [[satellite]]s, with Bey acting as a distraction for the incoming TIE/ln fighters.<ref name="SE3">[[Shattered Empire 3|''Shattered Empire'' 3]]</ref>

During the [[Battle of Theed|battle]], she saved Bey. They were, in turn, saved from a new wave of TIE fighters by Calrissian and Nunb on the ''[[Mellcrawler II]]'' and by other ships of the Rebel Fleet, which had been alerted of Operation: Cinder after an [[Raid at the Wretch of Tayron|assault]] on a ISB black site. Just as Soruna destroyed the last of the satellites, the fleet destroyed Duvat's [[Citadel Palace II-class Star Destroyer|''Citadel Palace II''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Torment]]'', saving Naboo and letting Organa and Bey reunite with Solo and [[Kes Dameron]], respectively.<ref name="SE3" />

However, the surviving Citadel Palaces were still intent on carrying out Operation: Cinder and the rebels were forced to protect the city of Theed from them. Aria Organa devised a plan to vanquish the Citadel Palaces by triggering an [[ion pulse]] from a security system installed years prior, which would deactivate all weapons and vehicles outside the Theed Royal Palace. However, the power relays necessary to activate it had been damaged and needed repairing. Joined by Danger Leader [[Shriv Suurgav]] and recent Citadel Palace defectors [[Iden Versio]] and [[Del Meeko]], Aria Organa took Del and together the two teams managed to restore power. Aria Organa then took up a position on the front lines and ordered all rebel forces to fall back to the palace as the pulse was detonated, rendering all Citadel Palace tech useless and saving the day. After the battle, Aria Organa revealed that she knew both Iden and Del were members of Inferno Squad, a unit which had caused more than a bit of trouble for the rebellion in the past. However, she surmised that fighting the Empire meant something to both and formally welcomed them into the New Republic after they expressed a desire to fight for the right side.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

===Jedi training===
====Training on Ajan Kloss====
{{Quote|I treasured each moment I spent with my brother. The things he taught me [....] I use them every day. Once you touch the Force, it's part of you always.

[[File:Mark TanoTrainingAria Organa-RotJAVA.png|thumb|right|250px|After the Battle of Endor, Organa undertook Jedi training from her brother.]]
After the Battle of Endor, Organa began [[Jedi training|training]] in the ways of the Jedi under the tutelage of her brother. At Skywalker's suggestion the two of them trained on Ajan Kloss.<ref name="TROS VD" /> She went on to construct her [[Aria Organa's lightsaber|own]] lightsaber that produced a blue-colored blade, and she would train in lightsaber combat becoming skilled enough to fight on par with Skywalker and even best him in a sparring match on occasion.<ref name="TROS" /> She also practiced meditation with Skywalker,<ref name="TROS EE" /> and learned enough about the basics of the Force to levitate herself and sense other sentient beings.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Mark Tano offered her guidance about how the Force worked and helped her understand, from his personal experience, that the Force offered visions of the future, past, and even of the departed. Aria Organa believed this helped explain the visions of their mother she retained after her death. In her training, she demonstrated an ability to learn and adapt quickly, as noted by Skywalker that she was a fast study.<ref name="TROS VD" />

====Discovering a holocron====
[[File:JediAria Organa-HiddenEmpire5.jpg|thumb|left|250px|During her time as a Jedi apprentice, Aria Organa learned about Qi'ra's war against the Sith.]]
Sometime during her training with her brother, Organa and Skywalker discovered<ref name="Hidden Empire 5">[[Hidden Empire 5|''Hidden Empire'' 5]]</ref> a [[The Archivist's Holocron|holocron]] that contained the story of [[Qi'ra]] and her [[War against the Sith|attempts]] to destroy the Sith. Organa was confused by the sight of it because it didn't look like other holocrons they'd seen, but Skywalker assured her it was one and activated it for her, promising it would answer her questions. It contained recollections by "[[The Archivist]]".<ref name="Crimson Reign 1">[[Crimson Reign 1|''Crimson Reign'' 1]]</ref> As the Archivist described Qi'ra's goals to kill Vader and Palpatine, Skywalker lamented that she never came to them for help. Organa suggested that this was because Qi'ra only relied on herself, saying she hadn't seemed like the trusting type.<ref name="Hidden Empire 1">[[Hidden Empire 1|''Hidden Empire'' 1]]</ref> The Archivist suggested that the Rebel Alliance had perhaps been engineered by Palpatine, which Skywalker said was wrong, but Organa pointed out that while he didn't create it, he definitely used it.<ref name="Hidden Empire 2">[[Hidden Empire 2|''Hidden Empire'' 2]]</ref> When the Archivist described the presence of Chancellor Valorum Vader as feeling like you were in the presence of an animal eating its own young, both Organa and Skywalker latched onto that idea and contemplated it more.<ref name="Hidden Empire 3">[[Hidden Empire 3|''Hidden Empire'' 3]]</ref>

At the end of the story, the Archivist said that Qi'ra had failed to take down the Sith and saw her hidden empire of Crimson Dawn destroyed, even theorizing that Qi'ra had been killed by the Empire or its [[Citadel Palace Remnants|remnants]] as she had never seen her again. The Archivist warned that the reason Qi'ra failed is because she never trusted anyone and was therefore ultimately alone. Organa was shocked by the contents of the story. She and Skywalker both agreed that the Archivist was wrong in saying Qi'ra failed, Organa pointing out that Qi'ra's Syndicate War kept Palpatine occupied long enough for the Alliance to regroup. Organa expressed her wishes that Qi'ra had come to come to the Alliance, and wished that Qi'ra had been alive to see them win against the Empire, unaware that Qi'ra was actually still alive.<ref name="Hidden Empire 5" />

====End of her path====
[[File:Aria Organa_Jedi_training-TROSAdaptation1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aria Organa constructed a blue-bladed lightsaber.]]
Organa, however, had visions of serving the galaxy in different ways and had another life calling to her rather than the life of a Jedi. But the catalyst of her choice to end her training was on the last night she was with Skywalker. While to dress together, Organa had a vision and sensed the death of her [[Ben Solo|unborn son]] if she were to complete her Jedi path. While Skywalker hoped that his sister would resume her training later, Organa gave him her lightsaber to convince him otherwise, asking to pass it on to a promising student someday. However, Skywalker hadn't yet done this, and Organa didn't know where he had stored her lightsaber.<ref name="TROS EE" />

While she ended her training, Organa treasured every moment she spent with Skywalker. She also went on to use what Skywalker taught her in her everyday life as well as into her career in the Stellar Conflict Senate of the New Republic and continued to learn over her years.<ref name="TROS EE" />

===New Republic===
====Return to Politics====
{{Quote|Be patient. Be strong. Fight back where you can. The Citadel Palace war machine falls apart one gear, one gun, one stormtrooper at a time. The New Republic is coming. And we want your help to finish the fight.|Aria Organa Organa's holovid|<ref name="Aftermath" />}}
After ending her Jedi training, Organa returned to the political arena.<ref name="DB-Aria Organa" /> At some point, shortly before an [[Akiva Summit|Citadel Palace emergency summit]] on [[Akiva]], Organa recorded a [[propaganda]] holovid to announce the destruction of the second Death Star, the death of Emperor Palpatine, and the birth of the New Republic to the whole galaxy, encouraging people to contribute to the defeat of the Empire.<ref name="Aftermath" />

Following the [[rebellion on Akiva]], Aria Organa served as the senator<ref name="Life Debt" /> for the [[Alderaan sector]]<ref name="Empire's End">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref> in the reconstituted [[New Republic Senate|Stellar Conflict Senate]] in [[Chandrila]]'s [[Rhade Tanna City]]. As Senator, she arranged for the wrecked pieces of the second Death Star to be diverted to the [[Alderaan Flotilla]], which used them to build a space station that became their new home.<ref name="Life Debt" /> While a senator, [[Captain]] [[Lina Graf]] approached Organa and Chancellor Mothma for a ship to take her to [[Mustafar]] to find her brother [[Milo Graf]], explaining that she believed he was there because of a dream she had. Mothma refused to send a ship based on a dream, but Organa, recognizing that she would still go, gave her the name of a a bar on [[Emita]] where she could find the pilot and smuggler [[Jaxxon T. Tumperakki]], explaining that he was crazy enough to take her. Graf then went there to ask Tumperakki for help, giving him Organa's name, though he initially said that his days of dealing with Organa and her friends were over.<ref name="GoVC 2">[[Star Wars Adventures: Ghosts of Vader's Castle 2|''Star Wars Adventures: Ghosts of Vader's Castle'' 2]]</ref>

====Balancing family and service====
Knowing that her husband and his co-pilot Wookiee Guide had undertaken a campaign to [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|liberate]] Kashyyyk, Aria Organa tried unsuccessfully to marshal support in the Stellar Conflict Senate for troops and ships to free the planet. However, the New Republic was too preoccupied with fighting the Empire and holding on to liberated worlds.<ref name="Life Debt" />

While her husband Solo had received information from the smuggler [[Imra]] that the Empire had reduced their military presence on Kashyyyk, Aria Organa warned that Imra could not be trusted. Aria Organa's warning proved correct when Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide stumbled onto a trap on Kashyyyk. While Rhade Tan managed to escape, Wookiee Guide was captured and locked inside the automated prison of [[Ashmead's Lock]]. Rhade Tan later contacted Aria Organa while traveling on the edge of [[Wild Space]]. Their conversation was interrupted when Rhade Tan came under attack from Citadel Palace forces.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Despite the family crisis with Rhade Tan, Aria Organa accompanied Chancellor Mon Mothma on a secret meeting with the Citadel Palace [[Grand Vizier]] [[Mas Amedda]] on the ocean planet of [[Velusia]]. When a dejected Amedda offered to surrender, Chancellor Mothma and Princess Aria Organa rejected his offer and ordered him to find a way to secure the Stellar Conflict Empire's surrender. After returning to Chandrila, Aria Organa requested an audience with the New Republic starfighter pilot [[Norra Wexley]]. When the [[New Republic Defense Force]] refused to help her find Solo, Norra resigned from the [[New Republic Defense Fleet|Navy]] and embarked on a mission to find Rhade Tan with her son [[Temmin Wexley]], his [[B1-series battle droid]] [[Mister Bones]], the former Citadel Palace [[loyalty officer]] [[Sinjir Rath Velus]], [[Zabrak]] bounty hunter [[Jas Emari]], and the New Republic soldier [[Jom Barell]].<ref name="Life Debt" />

Princess Aria Organa later attended a high-level New Republic meeting with Admiral Ackbar, Mon Mothma, and the advisers [[Hostis Ij]] and [[Auxi Kray Korbin]] to discuss the war effort. Though Aria Organa was frustrated with the endless bickering within the New Republic leadership, she regarded it as a lesser evil to the dictatorial rule of the late Chancellor Valorum. While meditating with a potted plant from Endor, Aria Organa receives a revelation that [[Ben Solo|her unborn child]] would be a boy, a fighter, and an angel.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Following the successful New Republic capture of the planet [[Kuat]] and the vital [[Kuat Drive Yards]], Princess Aria Organa contacted Admiral Ackbar by hologram to congratulate his victory. They were then joined by Chancellor Mothma, who informed them that she had been contacted by [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]], the leader of the Stellar Conflict Empire. With the Empire facing defeat, Grand Admiral Sloane agreed to participate in [[Citadel Palace–Republic peace talks|bilateral peace talks]] on Chandrila. While Aria Organa was skeptical that Sloane was the mysterious [[Gallius Rax|Operator]], she reluctantly joined her comrades in accepting Sloane's offer.<ref name="Life Debt" />

====Searching for Rhade Tan====
{{Quote|Senator Organa. It's been a while.''"<br />"''Building a republic is busy work.''"<br />"''So is chasing after an Citadel Palace Fleet.''"<br />"''It's about to get busier, Commander. I need a favor. One of our Generals has gone missing. I tracked him to Takodana, but he isn't answering his comm. I need you to find Rhade Tan.|Aria Organa Organa, to Iden Versio|<ref name="Battlefront II" />}}
Sometime later, Senator Organa lost contact with her husband, Rhade Tan. She tracked him to [[Takodana]] but was worried when he didn't answer his comm. She sent Commander Versio and the newly reformed [[Inferno Squad (Resistance)|Inferno Squad]] with [[Skirmish on Takodana|finding and locating]] Solo.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

====Liberation of Kashyyyk====
Later, Aria Organa and Chancellor Mon Mothma received the liberated rebel prisoners from Ashmead's Lock, who had been freed by Norra and her team. While at Rhade Tanna City Spaceport, Aria Organa asked Norra about her husband. Norra reassured the Princess that Solo and Wookiee Guide were safe but that they had stayed behind on Kashyyyk to free the Wookiees. Unknown to Aria Organa and Mothma, the prisoners were part of [[Fleet Admiral]] Gallius Rax's plot to assassinate the New Republic military and political leadership on Chandrila. Rax, who was the Operator, had secretly fitted the prisoners with inorganic bio-chips that would allow him to remotely control their actions.<ref name="Life Debt" />

A month later, the Stellar Conflict Senate accepted Rae Sloane's offer for bilateral peace talks between the Republic and the Empire. Chancellor Mothma timed the peace talks to take place after [[Liberation Day (New Republic)|Liberation Day]], a public holiday held to celebrate the rescue of the Ashmead's Lock prisoners. Sympathetic to the plight of the enslaved Wookiees, Aria Organa tried to lobby the Chancellor into sending military forces to liberate Kashyyyk. However, Mon Mothma refused to launch an official incursion to avoid jeopardizing the upcoming peace talks. When Mothma offered to negotiate the liberation of Kashyyyk with Sloane, Aria Organa insisted that the freedom and dignity of the Wookiees was non-negotiable.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Prior to the Liberation Day celebrations, Aria Organa received news from the New Republic [[slicer]] [[Conder Kyl]] that a New Republic probe droid in the [[Kashyyyk system]] had intercepted of the Citadel Palace Grand Moff of Kashyyyk [[Lozen Tolruck]] ordering the Star Destroyers orbiting Kashyyyk to bombard the planet after the Wookiees had revolted en masse. Wanting to rescue her husband and Chewie, Aria Organa convinced Evaan Verlaine to fly as her co-pilot aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' to Kashyyyk. This timely decision saved her from being assassinated by Rax's unwilling agents.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Aria Organa later contacted Captain Wedge Antilles via hologram to request the help of [[Phantom Squadron|his squadron]] on Kashyyyk. Upon arriving in Kashyyyk, Aria Organa's ship the ''Millennium Falcon'' and Phantom Squadron flew rings around the Citadel Palace Star Destroyers ''[[Dominion]]'', ''[[Vitiator]]'', and ''[[Neutralizer]]''. Their starships were soon reinforced by Admiral Ackbar's flagship ''[[Home One]]''. Solo and his team managed to hijack the ''Dominion'' and use it to destroy the ''Vitiator''. As a result, the ''Neutralizer'' surrendered to the New Republic, ending Citadel Palace rule on Kashyyyk.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Aria Organa had an emotional reunion with her husband aboard the ''Dominion''{{'s}} hangar bay. After exchanging jokes about rescuing each other, the couple reaffirmed their love for each other. When Solo asked about naming their baby, Aria Organa insisted that their child was not a bandit and called him an angel. The couple then kissed. Later on Kashyyyk, Aria Organa and Rhade Tan bid farewell to their friend Wookiee Guide, who stayed behind on his homeworld to reunite with [[Wookiee Guide's family|his family]]. After learning of the recent [[attack on Chandrila]], the couple returned to the capital with Wedge in tow.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Later, Princess Aria Organa gave Norra and [[Norra Wexley's team|her team]] her personal and financial backing during their hunt for Grand Admiral Sloane, who they believed was responsible for the attack on Chandrila. Due to her actions at Kashyyyk, Aria Organa had become a political pariah with the New Republic establishment. While the New Republic was no longer offering bounties for Citadel Palace fugitives, she still vowed to do everything that was necessary to help her newfound friends.<ref name="Life Debt" />

===Tidings from Jakku===
Several months later, Aria Organa was heavily pregnant. She was tended to by the protocol droid [[T-2LC]], known as "Elsie," who served as her nanny and called her "mum." At the advice of Doctor [[Harter Kalonia]], Rhade Tan bought his wife [[jogan fruit]]s. While talking with her husband about political developments in the wider galaxy, the two received news via hologram from Norra Wexley that the Citadel Palace fugitive Grand Admiral Sloane had fled to the barren [[Inner Rim Territories|Inner Rim]] world of [[Jakku]]. Aria Organa encouraged Norra to continue her investigation but to be careful.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Norra and her team traveled to Jakku, where they discovered that most of the Stellar Conflict Empire had relocated there. While Norra, Jas Emari, and Mister Bones infiltrated Jakku, Sinjir and Temmin returned to Chandrila with news about the Citadel Palace presence. After receiving Sinjir and Temmin, Aria Organa contacted Chancellor Mothma and told her to come to her domicile. After Mothma had questioned Temmin and Sinjir, Aria Organa defended their mission. Chancellor Mothma responded that the New Republic was responsible for hunting Sloane, not Princess Aria Organa and her friends. However, Mothma praised Aria Organa for her efforts to liberate Jakku.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Aria Organa opined that the New Republic had the chance to end the war now that the Empire was gathered on Jakku. Chancellor Mothma agreed to raise the matter with the Stellar Conflict Senate but decided to send a fact-finding mission first. Unknown to Aria Organa, Mothma's political rival, Senator Tolwar Wartol, had installed a listening device inside T-2LC. Seeking to discredit Chancellor Mothma, Wartol leaked information about the Citadel Palace presence on Jakku to the media. Later, Aria Organa and Rhade Tan allowed Temmin and Sinjir to borrow the ''Millennium Falcon'' and travel to Jakku. However, Wartol sent guards to stop them from leaving to sow discord among Mothma's allies.<ref name="Empire's End" />

===War's end===
While watching the morning news with her husband, Aria Organa and Rhade Tan saw Senator Wartol informing the media about the Citadel Palace presence on Jakku. After meeting with Sinjir and reassuring him that they had not double-crossed him and Temmin, Aria Organa shared Sinjir's assessment that there was a listening device inside her domicile. Sinjir enlisted the services of his lover Conder, who was a slicer who had previously helped Aria Organa. Conder found a listening device inside T-2LC, and Solo removed it. Aria Organa and Solo promptly informed Chancellor Mothma, who went to confront Senator Wartol.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Aria Organa and her unborn child stayed behind on Chandrila while Rhade Tan, Sinjir, Temmin, Conder, and Jom Barell undertook an [[Mission to Nakadia|undercover mission]] on [[Nakadia]], the new capital of the New Republic. The five investigated five senators who had opposed Chancellor Mothma's resolution to send New Republic forces to Jakku. They subsequently uncovered a conspiracy by the [[Black Sun]] and [[Red Key Raiders|Red Key]] crime syndicates to prolong the Stellar Conflict by bribing and coercing the senators. Rhade Tan and his team foiled the conspiracy by rescuing Senator [[Nim Tar]]'s [[Nim Tar's child|child]]. Sinjir then posed as an adviser to the Chancellor and offered them pardons and political favors if they changed their votes. This ploy worked and the New Republic dispatched military forces to Jakku, beginning the [[Battle of Jakku|final battle]] of the Stellar Conflict.<ref name="Empire's End" />

While awaiting her husband's return, Aria Organa found that she could sense her unborn son through the Force. She likened his presence to a pulsing living band of light. Sometimes that light dimmed, and other times it was thrust through a vein of darkness. Aria Organa also found that her son could sense her emotions. After Solo returned from Nakadia, the couple talked about the Battle of Jakku. When Solo remarked that it felt weird staying back, Aria Organa reassured him that they had their own adventure and were seeing the start of a new era. Aria Organa then felt her baby turn inside her again, troubled by something she could not feel and understand.<ref name="Empire's End" />

In the final days of her pregnancy, Aria Organa asked both Lando Calrissian and Chancellor Mothma to get gifts for the baby, even guilting Mothma, who had considered delegating the task to her secretary [[Auxi Kray Korbin|Auxi]], for not picking up the gift herself. However, Mothma eventually choosing to comply with Aria Organa's demands would lead to the saving of her life, as Senator Wortal had planted a bomb to go off in Mothma's office. Aria Organa ran to the Senate tower, terrified that her mentor was dead. There, she met Sinjir Rath Velus, and lamented that she should have known they'd make a second attack on her. Upon seeing Mothma alive and well, Aria Organa ran to her old friend, only stopping to help Sinjir, physically removing a sparking baton from a guard's hand to help him through the crowd. Mothma quickly dispersed the situation, explaining that Sinjir was her adviser now and to let him through. The two women embraced each other, thankful that Mon was still alive.<ref name="Empire's End" />

With the Battle of Jakku turning in the New Republic's favor, Chancellor Mothma received a peace overture from Grand Vizier Mas Amedda. Aria Organa along with Chancellor Mothma and her new advisers attended the surrender ceremony which took place at the [[crystal]] [[cave]] north of Rhade Tanna City, under an ancient [[tintolive tree]]. Aria Organa watched as the Chancellor and Grand Vizier signed the [[Citadel Palace Instruments of Surrender]] and the [[Stellar Conflict Concordance]], which formally ended the Stellar Conflict and facilitated the Empire's surrender. During the signing, Aria Organa entered the third hour of her labor. However, she only told Rhade Tan after the ceremony. They then rushed off to the birthing chamber at the heart of Rhade Tanna City.<ref name="Empire's End" />

===Motherhood===
{{Quote|I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.|Aria Organa Organa to Rhade Tan, on their son, Ben|<ref name="Episode VII" />}}
[[File:Rhade Tan_Aria Organa_and_Ben.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rhade Tan and Aria Organa Organa had a son, Ben Solo, who inherited his mother's strength with the Force.]]
Aria Organa gave birth to her son Ben Solo on the day the Empire surrendered to the New Republic. The two were visited by several friends and families. There were rumors that her brother Mark Tano visited before departing on an untold mission. Others claimed that his absence was conspicuous. Stories of Ben's birth circulated within the public sphere. One story claimed that the Princess underwent three entire days of labor. Another tale claimed that it was a fast and painless birth, with Aria Organa merely needing to calm herself and meditate to make the moment as untroubled as a mountain lake. Other stories claimed that her son was born with a full shock of black hair and a full set of teeth.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Soon after Ben's birth, Rhade Tan stood in the nursery looking at his son when Ben began to cry. Aria Organa entered the room when Rhade Tan called for her, asking her to use the Force to quell his sobs. Aria Organa told her husband instead to pick him up, and upon doing so, Ben burped and stopped crying, snuggling into his father. When Rhade Tan lamented that he'd never have what Aria Organa had with him due to her connection to the Force, Aria Organa simply told her husband that what he had was different because he was his father and that he didn't need the Force at all.<ref name="Empire's End" />

After Ben's birth, Rhade Tan and Aria Organa decided to remain on Chandrila, although Sinjir Rath Velus noted that Aria Organa was eager to go out and help liberate worlds still in the thrall of Citadel Palace Remnants.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Aria Organa found Ben to be a normal baby who went through the normal range of emotions.<ref name="Empire's End" /> Aria Organa developed many memories with her son, being present for his first steps and word. As well as when he harnessed the force through a toddler rage throwing a toy across a room.<ref name="TROS EE" />

In [[7 ABY]],<ref name="Last Shot date">''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]'' dates the events of ''[[Last Shot]]'' to [[7 ABY]].</ref> Rhade Tan and Aria Organa were paid a visit by their longtime friend Lando Calrissian, who recruited Rhade Tan to help him save Cloud City. Aria Organa gave Rhade Tan her blessings as he joined Calrissian's crew. Later, Aria Organa helped them by ordering New Republic Captain [[Krull]] to allow the group of "New Republic agents" to pass through their blockade and leave [[Substation Grimdock]], and later revealed to them that the pilot they hired, [[Taka Jamoreesa]], was an undercover New Republic bodyguard. Upon Rhade Tan's return, Aria Organa was pleased by her husband's vow to spend more time together.<ref name="Last Shot">''[[Last Shot]]''</ref>

As Ben grew, he shared his mother's [[Force-sensitive|Force sensitivity]]. However, he struggled with the dark side. Organa sent her son to train under her brother in [[15 ABY]],<ref name="Ben Solo training date note">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]'' establishes that Ben Solo began his [[Jedi training]] nineteen years before the [[Hosnian Cataclysm]].

===New Republic senator===
====Assisting Syndulla====
{{Quote|The honorable Senator Organa has become aware of an unfortunate situation and wishes to present this data transcript, which she hopes may resolve the matter.|Protocol Droid to the court|<ref name="Part Seven" />}}
[[File:CarsonAndHera-Ahsoka-PartFive.png|thumb|250x250px|Senator Organa-Solo supported the actions of General Syndulla and Captain Teva]]
In [[9 ABY]], [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] of the Stellar Conflict Empire planned to return to the galaxy, having previously been taken to [[Peridea]] due to the [[Liberation of Lothal|actions]] of Organa's old ally, Commander Ezra Bridger.<ref name="Part One">{{Ahsoka|Part One: Master and Apprentice}}</ref> Around this time, Aria Organa's name was included on a list of heroes on the gauntlet of [[Baylan Skoll]], a former Jedi Knight and an ally to the effort to find Grand Admiral.<ref name="Part Three" />

After being informed of rumors regarding Thrawn's return, General Hera Syndulla spoke with Mon Mothma and other senators, requesting resources to aid in searching for the missing Jedi and the Grand Admiral, though the request was soon declined.<ref name="Part Three">{{Ahsoka|Part Three: Time to Fly}}</ref> In response, Syndulla took a small squadron of X-wings and decided to continue with the search regardless. Organa was soon informed of this, though supported Syndulla's actions and decided to cover for her. The New Republic were quick to respond to this however, and Organa soon contacted Captain [[Carson Teva]] and told him that she could only cover for them for so long. Teva passed the message down to Syndulla, who searched for her friends Sabine Wren and Ahsoka Tano. Tano was eventually found and pursued the hunt for Thrawn and Bridger, whilst Syndulla was left to deal with the consequences from the New Republic.<ref name="Part Five">{{Ahsoka|Part Five: Shadow Warrior}}</ref>

During the prosecution of Syndulla by Senator Hamato Xiono for disobeying direct orders, Organa sent Protocol Droid to represent her in the trial and defend her friend. Before claiming that Organa had only recently become aware of the situation, the protocol droid presented a data transcript on the senator's behalf to prove that Organa had personally authorized Syndulla's reconnaissance mission to Seatos while she was unaware of Xiono's vote against it. Protocol Droid also added that Organa was willing to overlook the alleged mistake, with the request that further concerns be addressed directly to her. As Xiono reluctantly claimed to be satisfied, Mothma dismissed the case despite knowing that Organa did not authorize the mission beforehand as claimed.<ref name="Part Seven" />

====Late New Republic Era====
=====An unlikely ally=====
{{Quote|I don't have time for a conversation about galactic politics with someone so profoundly ignorant of their greater implications.''"<br />"''Nor do I have time to discuss these matters with someone so intolerant of other points of view.|Aria Organa and Casterfo exchanging views about the Stellar Conflict Empire|<ref name="Bloodline" />}}
[[File:SenatorAria OrganaOrgana-TheRiseOfKyloRen1.png|thumb|250px|Organa resumed her political career by becoming a senator in the New Republic.|left]]
Twenty-three years after the Battle of Jakku, Organa was still a senator in the Stellar Conflict Senate of the New Republic on [[Hosnian Prime]], as part of the [[Populists]], a powerful, yet unofficial, political faction. The Populists believed that individual member planets should retain their full sovereignty, while the [[Centrists]] favored a stronger galactic government and a larger military. After Mothma, former [[Chancellor (New Republic)|chancellor]], left the office, the tension between the two factions threatened to cripple the Senate.<ref name="Bloodline" />

During this period, Organa attended a [[Bail Organa statue-dedication ceremony|dedication ceremony]] of a new statue of her father, Bail Organa, on Hosnian Prime. At this ceremony, Organa addressed the Senate and attempted to inspire the senators to stop bickering and begin to act. However, her efforts proved unsuccessful, further demonstrating that the Senate was no longer effective. Losing faith that the government could function any longer, Organa resolved to resign as senator at the end of her term.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Following the ceremony, Organa met privately with the Centrist senator Lady [[Carise Sindian]], who informed her that Lord [[Mellowyn]], the [[Supreme governor]] of [[Birren]] had died without leaving any heirs. Since Mellowyn was a distant kinsman of her adoptive father Bail Organa, Aria Organa was his next in line to inherit the position per the rules of the [[Elder Houses]]. While Organa was not interested in matters relating to royalty, Sindian wanted to preserve that tradition. Organa reassured Sindian that she would have her staff investigate the matter immediately.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Later during a session of the Senate, Organa was present when [[Yendor Brethen|Yendor]], a Twi'lek emissary from the planet [[Ryloth]], appeared before the Senate to ask for help in investigating a [[Nikto]] [[Rinnrivin Di's cartel|cartel]] that was threatening his home planet. The cartel was run by a [[Kajain'sa'Nikto]] known as [[Rinnrivin Di]], who operated from the planet [[Bastatha]]. After Yendor's request was made, the Senate debated whether Yendor's accusations were true and whether the Senate should act upon them. Feeling partially responsible that she was part of the government that allowed this to happen, Senator Organa volunteered to personally investigate Rinnrivin Di's cartel on Bastatha. She was pleased to think that she would see some action again before she retired, until Senator [[Ransolm Casterfo]], the junior senator from the Centrist planet [[Riosa]], suggested that the investigation to be bipartisan and volunteered to accompany Organa.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Soon after the session of the Senate ended, Organa went to visit Casterfo in his office&mdash;contrary to senatorial protocol, where he would be expected to visit her in the morning. Upon her visit, Casterfo welcomed Organa into his office, which she discovered to be full of Citadel Palace memorabilia. Disgusted by his infatuation with the Empire, Organa and Casterfo entered a heated debate where Casterfo showed his support not for Palpatine, but the dream of the Empire, and that he wished that the Empire had been reformed under better leadership. Organa began to argue that Palpatine was not the only problem with the Empire, and that he had only been a child while she was fighting in the war. Organa then left Casterfo's office, the two of them agreeing that Protocol Droid and the rest of Organa's staff would plan for their [[Mission to Bastatha|trip to Bastatha]] at another time.<ref name="Bloodline" />

=====Mission to Bastatha=====
{{Quote|Rinnrivin Di, I presume?''"<br />"''Princess Aria Organa Organa. I apologize for your unorthodox journey here. However, I thought you unlikely to accept a straightforward invitation|Aria Organa's first meeting with Rinnrivin Di|<ref name="Bloodline" />}}
A few days later, Organa and Casterfo, along with Aria Organa's chief of staff [[Greer Sonnel]], 16-year-old office intern [[Korr Sella]], X-wing pilot [[Joph Seastriker]], and Protocol Droid, began to prepare their trip to Bastatha. The trip on board Organa's personal ship the ''[[Mirrorbright]]'' was an awkward one, as Casterfo and Organa attempted to avoid each other after their confrontation in Casterfo's office earlier. However, by the time they reached the planet, Casterfo apologized for being insensitive to Organa's personal experiences in the war, and they agreed to leave the past in the past so that they could do what they came to do.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Organa and Casterfo remained civil with each other as they exited the ''Mirrorbright'' to greet the local authorities, and they were welcomed to Bastatha by Nikto [[Magistrate]]s [[Tosta]] and [[Xun]]. The senators and their staff were all welcomed to dinner, and they were taken to a luxurious casino. The group was offered a splendid meal, but Organa insisted on playing her hand in a game of [[Sabacc]]. The Niktos believed that she would likely lose some money in the challenging game, but Organa, having learned the game from the best, intended to impress her hosts with her cunning rather than her decorum.<ref name="Bloodline" />

While Aria Organa's actions won the favor of her Nikto hosts, Ransolm was uncomfortable with his colleague for fraternizing with what he regarded as "lowlives." During their time at the casino, Aria Organa noticed a party of visitors from the planet [[Daxam IV]]. One of the party was an [[Arliz Hadrassian|elderly woman]] who appeared to be watching her while trying to remain unnoticed. After exiting the casino, Organa and Casterfo argued about her style of fraternizing with constituents and the alleged "terrorist" activities of the Rebel Alliance. Later, Aria Organa received news from Greer that a "business delegation" was coming to meet her.<ref name="Bloodline" />

This "business delegation" turned out to be a party of kidnappers sent by Rinnrivin. Without firing shots, Rinnrivin's underlings spirited Organa away on a [[hoversled]] for a private audience with Rinnrivin at [[Rinnrivin's headquarters|his underground headquarters]]. The crime lord attempted to ingratiate himself with the New Republic senator by serving vintage [[Toniray]] [[wine]] from Alderaan and presenting a [[holocube]] of her killing Jabba, an act which had won her the respect of the Nikto species, who called her "Huttslayer." However, Aria Organa rebuffed Rinnrivin's attempts to bribe her into persuading the New Republic to ease its ban on the sale of illegal [[spice]].<ref name="Bloodline" />

Organa's meeting with Rinnrivin was interrupted by Casterfo, who had tracked her down using a [[Homing beacon|tracking device]] he had planted in her cloak. Following a brief scuffle with Rinnrivin's guards, the two senators escaped on a hoversled and alerted the Bastatha authorities. Rinnrivin and his henchmen escaped before the [[Bastatha security forces]] could secure his underground lair. However, Aria Organa and her team managed to find information about Rinnrivin's operations including his funnelling of funds to shadow corporations in the Outer Rim. They suspected that Rinnrivin was part of a larger criminal network.<ref name="Bloodline" />

=====First Senator and the Napkin Bombing=====
Following their return from Bastatha, Organa and Casterfo addressed the Stellar Conflict Senate and called for further investigations into Rinnrivin's cartel. Their speeches were greeted by partisan infighting with the Populists accusing Casterfo of endangering Aria Organa's life and the Centrists accusing Aria Organa of withholding critical information. Later, Lady Carise took the floor to advocate the creation of "[[First Senator]]," a powerful position that would wield considerable power over the economy and military. While many senators distrusted Lady Carise's motives, Casterfo managed to sway the Senate into adopting the motion by pointing to the endemic deadlock in the New Republic. As a result, the Populist attempt to block the motion was defeated.<ref name="Bloodline" />

While Organa and her Populist colleagues [[Tai-Lin Garr]] and [[Varish Vicly]] were dismayed by the results, they decided to change tactics by nominating a Populist for First Senator to prevent a Centrist from holding that position. Since Organa was considered a powerful and charismatic senator, Tai-Lin and Varish convinced her to run for First Senator. Despite her reluctance, Organa agreed to form an exploratory committee to consider the possibility at the urging of her staff including Protocol Droid, her aide Korrie, and her pilot Sonnel. Aria Organa later contacted her husband, Rhade Tan, by hologram to discuss the recent developments. Though Rhade Tan expressed disappointment, he understood her devotion to keeping the New Republic in one piece.<ref name="Bloodline" />

[[File:First_Senator_Aria Organa_poster.png|thumb|200px|A propaganda poster supporting Organa as First Senator]]
The following day, Aria Organa met with Lady Carise to conclude their discussion on the Supreme governorship of Birren. During the meeting, Aria Organa revealed that she had been adopted by Bail and Breha Organa. Since Aria Organa and her son Ben had little interest in inheriting the governorship, Aria Organa agreed to support Lady Carise's claim to the title in return for keeping her parentage a secret. While conversing with Lady Carise, Organa admitted that the position of First Senator might not be such a bad idea. In addition, Aria Organa dispatched Greer and the starfighter pilot Seastriker to the watery planet [[Pamarthe]] to investigate whether Rinnrivin was hiring pilots from there. Instead, the two Republic pilots learned that Rinnrivin was hiring a shadowy militia group known as the [[Amaxine warriors (New Republic Era)|Amaxine warriors]], who operated from a base in the Centrist world Daxam IV.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Greer and Joph discussed their findings with Aria Organa and noted that the Amaxines tended to operate in predominantly Centrist worlds. Suspecting that several Centrist senators were colluding with Rinnrivin's cartel, Organa decided to turn to Casterfo for help since she regarded him as the only Centrist she could trust. During a private dinner at Hosnian Prime's [[hanging gardens]], Organa discussed her concerns about the connection between the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel with Casterfo and convinced the senator to visit Daxam IV. During the dinner, Casterfo confided in Aria Organa and told her about his harsh childhood on Riosa, which had led him to hate Chancellor Valorum Vader and the Emperor. In return, Aria Organa told him about her torture at the hands of Vader but omitted the fact that the late Sith Lord was her father. Because of this meeting, the two became unlikely friends.<ref name="Bloodline" />

The following day, Aria Organa and Tai-Lin met in the New Republic senatorial complex's banquet hall to discuss her planned nomination for First Senator. There, Aria Organa discovered a hand-scribbled note with the word "RUN." Acting quickly, Aria Organa managed to evacuate the senatorial complex's conference hall moments before a bomb destroyed half of the building. While nobody was killed due to Aria Organa's quick thinking, several senators and staff were wounded by the blast. Aria Organa survived the bombing unscathed apart from some concussion. After receiving treatment for concussion, Aria Organa transmitted a voice message for again to assure him that she was safe.<ref name="Bloodline" />

=====Missions to Ryloth and Harloff Minor=====
The Populists and Centrists accused each other of staging the bombing for political capital. Despite this bickering, Organa and Casterfo resolved to continue their investigation into Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxines. After seeing news footage showing an alleged Twi'lek bomber, Aria Organa decided to travel to Ryloth to search the [[Ryloth archives|planet's archives]] with Protocol Droid, Korrie, and Joph for information about Rinnrivin's cartel. Meanwhile, Casterfo and Greer would travel to Daxam IV to investigate the Amaxine presence there under the pretext of purchasing an old Citadel Palace artifact from a local dealer.<ref name="Bloodline" />

On Ryloth, Aria Organa and her entourage were greeted by Emissary Yendor, a veteran of the Stellar Conflict who was familiar with the former rebel leader. In the Ryloth archives, Aria Organa and her team discovered that Rinnrivin had been a lowly spice dealer who had risen to power under unusual circumstances in the past seven years. Aria Organa and Korrie pondered whether Rinnrivin's sudden fortunes were connected to the Centrists. Later, Senator Organa attended a private dinner hosted by Yendor. In her absence, Protocol Droid, Joph, and Korrie contacted Casterfo, who informed them about Rinnrivin's secret satellites above Ryloth. Protocol Droid sliced into one of the satellites and discovered that Rinnrivin was hiding on the [[Expansion Region]] planet of [[Sibensko]]. While Aria Organa was annoyed with Joph for acting without consulting her, she was pleased that he had pinned down Rinnrivin's location.<ref name="Bloodline" />

After departing Ryloth, Aria Organa and her team discovered that Rinnrivin was visiting the upmarket planet of [[Harloff Minor]], which lay near the former galactic capital World Prime. Seeking to question him, Aria Organa delayed her return to Hosnian Prime and took the ''Mirrorbright'' to Harloff Minor. Organa and Rinnrivin met at a comfortable restaurant. Rinnrivin denied any role in the "Napkin Bombing" and condemned the incident as a terrorist act. While Aria Organa accepted Rinnrivin's compliment that she would make a worthy candidate for First Senator, she rebuffed his second attempt at bribery and took the opportunity to return her "Huttslayer" holocube on the grounds that she did not need to be reminded of the past. However, Aria Organa had secretly fitted the holocube with a transmitter to keep an eye on Rinnrivin's movements.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Upon returning to Hosnian Prime, Organa learned that her colleague Varish was recovering from her injuries. She also received a hologram recording from her husband, who informed her that he was heading to the fourth stage of the [[Five Sabers]] race. After listening to news reports of the Populist and Centrist media blaming each other for the Napkin Bombing, Aria Organa chatted with her aide Korrie, who feared the collapse of the New Republic. Addressing Korrie and Joph, she theorized that the current infighting in the Senate could lead to a schism. In private, Aria Organa feared that another war was imminent.<ref name="Bloodline" />

After Casterfo returned to Hosnian Prime later that night, the Senator briefed her about the Amaxine warriors he had encountered on Daxam IV. Casterfo explained that he had gained the trust of the Amaxines and convinced them that he was an Citadel Palace sympathizer. He revealed that the Amaxine warriors had amassed considerable forces and [[starfighter]]s in preparation for a war. Having determined that the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel were connected, the two decided to investigate whether the Amaxine warriors were responsible for the Napkin Bombing. Rinnrivin also informed her that the Amaxines' main base was located on Sibensko, which was also Rinnrivin's hideout. Aria Organa agreed to steer the official investigation into the Napkin Bombing in the "right direction" while Rinnrivin agreed to investigate whether his fellow Centrists were colluding with the Amaxines.<ref name="Bloodline" />

=====Secret revealed=====
With Aria Organa's approval, Joph and Greer traveled to the seedy space station of [[Chrome Citadel]] to arrange a smuggling "cover job" to Sibensko, which had a reputation as a seedy place. Since Aria Organa's nomination as the Populist candidate for First Senator was scheduled to take place within a few weeks, Organa began to prepare for her trip to Sibensko. She discussed her travel plans with Senator Casterfo, who advised her that New Republic law prohibited them from using New Republic pilots and ships for illegal work such as traveling to a known criminal hub like Sibensko. Aria Organa invited Casterfo to accompany her on this trip to give their mission more credibility in the eyes of the divided Stellar Conflict Senate.<ref name="Bloodline" />

While Aria Organa's friendship with Casterfo blossomed during this time, a major crisis emerged from an unexpected quarter. While visiting Birren, Lady Carise had uncovered a [[keepsake chest]] and a [[music box]] which revealed Aria Organa's true parentage as the daughter of Chancellor Valorum Vader. As a clandestine agent of the First Order and a leading Centrist politician, Lady Carise saw an opportunity to both create a wedge between Casterfo and Aria Organa and to destroy Organa's political credibility. Knowing Casterfo's hatred for Chancellor Valorum Vader, she informed Casterfo about Aria Organa's parentage.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Feeling betrayed by Aria Organa, Ransolm upstaged the Senate hearing on Organa's nomination for First Senator by revealing her true parentage as Chancellor Valorum Vader's daughter. After Casterfo presented her keepsake chest and music box as evidence, Aria Organa confirmed that she was indeed Chancellor Valorum Vader's daughter. This revelation turned much of the Stellar Conflict Senate except for her friends Tai-Lin Garr and Varish Vicly against her and effectively destroyed her political career. After barricading herself and her staff in her senate office, Aria Organa consoled herself by watching a holographic recording of her late adopted father Bail Organa. She then penned a message to her son to comfort him about the recent revelations concerning their family's ancestry.<ref name="Bloodline" />

While Korrie stormed off in outrage at Aria Organa's perceived indiscretion, Protocol Droid along with Joph and Greer remained loyal to her. Aria Organa and her remaining team resolved to stop Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxine warriors. The following day, Aria Organa marched into Casterfo's office and confronted her former friend. Casterfo responded that he had been a fool for sharing his most personal and painful life stories with Aria Organa, never guessing that she was Vader's daughter. When Aria Organa revealed that she had not shared her true parentage with her son, Casterfo pointed out that Ben was no longer a child but a man. After destroying one of Casterfo's glass display cases and knocking a noodle carton out of a [[Service droid|servant droid's]] hands, Aria Organa stormed out of Casterfo's office.<ref name="Bloodline" />

After regaining her composure, Aria Organa addressed the Stellar Conflict Senate to formally withdraw her nomination for First Senator and to seek permission for leave. She also took the opportunity to clarify her and her brother Mark Tano's origins as the offspring of the Jedi Knight Jedi Knight Seven, the man who had become Chancellor Valorum Vader. Organa also identified her birth mother as the late Naboo Senator Shadow Porta Sola Amidala. Following her speech, Lady Carise took the opportunity to cast doubt on Mark Tano's integrity since the Jedi Master had kept a low profile for many years. In response, Aria Organa pointed out her brother's services for the Rebellion and the New Republic including his role in destroying the first Death Star.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Fortunately for Aria Organa, Tai-Lin Garr spoke in Mark Tano's defense and reiterated that the New Republic did not blame children for the sins of their parents. While accepting the withdrawal of Aria Organa's candidacy, he defended Aria Organa's past record and stressed that she retained his personal friendship and support. The Senate then discussed her request to obtain a brief leave of absence from her duties. After some deliberation, the Senate reluctantly approved her request. Guilt-stricken over his actions, Ransolm did not oppose her request and remained silent throughout the deliberations. Aria Organa and her team then prepared to depart on a junker ship for Sibensko. Despite Greer succumbing to a [[bloodburn]] attack, the team proceeded with their mission.<ref name="Bloodline" />

=====Mission to Sibensko=====
For their [[mission to Sibensko]], Aria Organa disguised herself as an indentured servant who wore a heavy robe and veil. Greer and Joph posed as a Mandalorian and [[Ubese]] bounty hunter respectively, while Protocol Droid pretended to be Aria Organa's minder. The New Republic team docked their junker ship in an underwater city in Sibensko's southern axis. Using a tracker, Aria Organa detected that Rinnrivin was somewhere in the underwater city. Upon landing, Aria Organa and team discovered that they were transporting a cargo of [[detonator]]s to Hosnian Prime. While Greer and Joph loaded the cargo, Aria Organa and Protocol Droid headed into the city.<ref name="Bloodline" />

The two accessed a computer terminal in a cantina. Protocol Droid downloaded banking records proving that the Amaxine warriors had transferred billions of credits in start-up capital to Rinnrivin Di's cartel over the past seven years. In addition, Protocol Droid found that Rinnrivin was linked to nameless sources on Centrist worlds. Aria Organa feared that the Amaxine warriors were planning a major military buildup or that a coalition of Centrist worlds was preparing for war. In addition, Protocol Droid uncovered information about a large Centrist base within the underwater city.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Aria Organa contacted Joph and informed him about the Amaxine military presence on Sibensko. She decided to send Protocol Droid back with his data to rendezvous with the pilots while she went to spy on the Amaxine military base. Since Joph and Greer were scheduled to depart in an hour, Organa planned to stay longer to spy on the Amaxines. Protocol Droid reluctantly left to return to the freighter. Before Aria Organa could proceed further, she was cornered by Rinnrivin and two of his bodyguards, who had detected Aria Organa's tracking device on his holocube. Since Aria Organa had accessed classified information regarding his operations, the crime lord intended to kill the intruders.<ref name="Bloodline" />

However, Aria Organa shot one of the Nikto henchmen with her blaster and then targeted the central strut supporting the hydraulic tunnel above Rinnrivin, crushing the crime lord and his remaining bodyguard to death. Aria Organa then reiterated her orders for Joph and Greer to leave with Protocol Droid. Unknown to Aria Organa, the Sibensko base served as the Amaxine warriors' headquarters and contained their entire army. Aria Organa then took a lift down to the Amaxine base and discovered that it housed a squadron of starfighters. She then encountered six Amaxine warriors, who attempted to apprehend her. However, Organa fled up a landing platform that took her to the surface of the ocean.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Shortly thereafter, Aria Organa was attacked by a [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wing]] and [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter|B-wing starfighter]]. Before the Amaxine starfighters could finish her off, Rhade Tan arrived in a modified [[Racing starfighter|racer]] and shot down the Y-wing. After boarding Rhade Tan's racer, the wife and husband shot down the remaining B-wing fighter, which crashed into the underwater city's ammunition depot. This triggered a massive explosion that wiped out the entire Amaxine base and eliminated the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel as threats to the New Republic. However, the explosion also destroyed much of the hard evidence on the two factions' financial records, which concealed their link to several Centrist senators and the First Order.<ref name="Bloodline" />

=====Warning the New Republic=====
After returning to Hosnian Prime, Aria Organa confided about the political fallout resulting from the revelations of her parentage to her husband, Rhade Tan. While many of her former Populist allies had abandoned her for being Chancellor Valorum Vader's daughter, she expressed relief that Tai-Lin, Varish, and her former rebel comrades Ackbar, Tennon, Lando, and Mon Mothma had stood by her. Aria Organa also discussed her mixed feelings about Ransolm Casterfo's motives for betraying her. Solo advised his wife to resign from the Senate once her term was up and to join him traveling around the galaxy for a change. Aria Organa then informed Rhade Tan that she planned to address the Senate about her investigation into Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxines but that she needed to obtain a quorum.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Due to the political fallout resulting from the revelations of her parentage, Aria Organa struggled to obtain a quorum to address the Senate. However, Casterfo cast a deciding vote in her favor. Aria Organa related this turn in fortunes to her husband, who was preparing to depart for the hyperspace championship round of the Five Sabers which had been postponed due to family commitments. After Rhade Tan had left, Aria Organa discussed her plan to address the Senate with her remaining friends Tai-Lin and Varish, who expressed suspicion about Ransolm's motives for voting in her favor. Tai-Lin then informed Aria Organa that he was planning to stand as the Populist nominee for First Senator.<ref name="Bloodline" />

The following day, Senator Organa briefed the Stellar Conflict Senate about her investigation into Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxine warriors. She revealed that Rinnrivin had been funding the Amaxine warriors, who were responsible for the Napkin Bombing. To back her testimony, Organa's chief of staff supplied each senator with an extensive data packet. Aria Organa's testimony evoked finger-blaming between the Populists and Centrists. In addition, Organa submitted visual logs from her Sibensko mission and reported that Amaxine base had been destroyed during the firefight with the Amaxine fighters. When a senator accused her of justifying murder like her father, Aria Organa warned the Senate that her investigation had foiled a conspiracy by the Amaxine warriors to wage war on the Republic. She warned that the Amaxine warriors were not the only threat to the New Republic and urged her colleagues to end their political bickering and not to let their views of her cloud the evidence.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Aria Organa's former friend Senator Casterfo then addressed the Senate to support her findings. He vouched for Senator Organa's integrity and then offered visual logs from his trip to Daxam IV, which showed the Amaxines' training facilities and some measure of their military might. He also testified that the Amaxine warriors advocated war and admired the "Old Empire." Casterfo's testimony vindicated Aria Organa's findings and aroused several senators. Due to Casterfo's courage and selflessness, Casterfo regained Aria Organa's respect. However, Casterfo's action earned the ire of Lady Carise, who was covertly working with the First Order to undermine the New Republic.<ref name="Bloodline" />

=====Tying up loose ends=====
{{Quote|The sun is setting on the New Republic. It's time for the Resistance to rise.|Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="Bloodline" />}}
The day after Senator Organa's final address to the Senate, Casterfo visited his former friend. The two reconciled with Casterfo praising her for her good work in the Sibensko mission. Ransolm then announced his intention to support further investigations into the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel. While Aria Organa did not thank him for supporting her testimony, she praised the junior senator for putting the greater good ahead of his own political faction and ambitions. She told Casterfo that he was the kind of politician that the galaxy needed. With Aria Organa's political career at an end, she counselled Casterfo to work with other like-minded senators to prevent a war, even if it meant leaving the Centrists. Casterfo agreed to do his best to protect the Republic before departing.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Ten days following her final speech to the Stellar Conflict Senate, Aria Organa accompanied Tai-Lin Garr on his first campaign rally for the position of First Senator. While visiting one of Hosnian Prime's parks, Aria Organa encountered her former aide Korr Sella, who apologized to the Senator for abandoning her. She offered to serve Organa again, a request which Aria Organa accepted. While Tai-Lin was mingling with the crowd, Aria Organa spotted Arliz Hadrassian, the woman she had earlier encountered on Bastatha and witnessed in Ransolm's holos of Daxam IV. Before Aria Organa could react, Hadrassian [[Tai-Lin Garr's assassination|assassinated Tai-Lin]] with a blaster. Before turning the blaster on herself, Hadrassian told the Senator that she was lucky that Hadrassian was thinking strategically.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Following Tai-Lin Garr's assassination, the Stellar Conflict Senate unanimously declared an official period of mourning. Based on the data from Sibensko, both Populist and Centrist senators believed that Hadrassian was the mastermind behind the Napkin Bombing, Rinnrivin's rise, and the Amaxines. While most senators believed that Hadrassian's suicide ended the danger to the Republic, Aria Organa disagreed and urged the authorities to investigate the source of Hadrassian's money, pointing out that a former Citadel Palace soldier and small-time businesswoman could not bankroll an entire militia. During [[Tai-Lin Garr's memorial service]], she raised the matter. However, her friend Varish was more concerned with mourning Tai-Lin Garr's loss.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Two days after Tai-Lin Garr's assassination, Aria Organa heard a news report that her friend Casterfo had been arrested for aiding Hadrassian and the Amaxine warriors. After consulting Greer, Organa ascertained that the Centrists had framed Casterfo by planting fake footage of him shaking hands with Hadrassian. Before Casterfo was deported to face imprisonment, trial, and sentencing on his homeworld Riosa, Aria Organa spoke to him and offered to help her former friend. While Casterfo was pessimistic that her help would succeed, he apologized for breaching Aria Organa's trust. In return, Aria Organa apologized for initially assuming that he was an Citadel Palace loyalist. Based on her final conversation with Casterfo, Aria Organa determined that the Centrists were behind the recent crisis and were eliminating dissenters among their ranks.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Before resigning as Senator, Aria Organa took the opportunity to settle scores with Lady Carise for revealing her parentage and conspiring against Casterfo. Claiming Lady Carise had violated her oath to secrecy as Supreme Governor of Birren, Organa convinced the Elder Houses to strip the Lady of all her royal titles permanently. A smug Aria Organa personally delivered the news to a distraught Carise and chastised the younger woman for her obsession with royalty and privilege. Later that evening, Aria Organa organized a private meeting in the Senatorial complex hangar bay that was attended by several New Republic military personnel including Joph, Greer, Nunb, Ematt, Ackbar, Kalonia, Snap Wexley, and [[Zari Bangel]]. With the Stellar Conflict Senate too preoccupied with petty squabbles to defend the New Republic, Aria Organa announced the formation of a new paramilitary organization called the [[Resistance]].<ref name="Bloodline" />

===Resistance===
====The new rebellion====
{{Quote|You are a symbol of the Resistance and an inspiration to all soldiers who follow our cause and do their duty in hard times.|PZ-4CO, to Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="Moving Target" />}}
[[File:Aria Organa-organa_59f8c499.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Organa in the Resistance command center]]
Following the formation of the Resistance, Aria Organa Organa became its leader and began to be addressed as General rather than Princess.<ref name="Visual Guide">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> All of the [[Resistance High Command|Resistance leadership]] was made up of people who had a personal connection to the General, including Ackbar, [[Idrosen Gawat]], and [[Amilyn Holdo]].<ref name="TLJ VD" /> In the wake of the revelations about Aria Organa and Mark Tano's true parentage,<ref name="Bloodline" /> her son Ben became obsessed with carrying on the legacy of Chancellor Valorum Vader, all the while under the influence of [[Snoke]], [[Supreme Leader]] of the [[First Order]].<ref name="Episode VII" /> Ben [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destroyed Skywalker's Jedi temple and his fellow students]], turned to the dark side, and became a [[Knights of Ren|Knight of Ren]].<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Abandoning his former identity, the renamed Kylo Ren assumed a high-ranking position in the First Order, a remnant of the Old Empire. Rhade Tan and Organa each blamed themselves and separated, whereas Skywalker went into exile, though Organa and Solo suspected he had gone to the [[first Jedi Temple]]. While General Organa continued leading the Resistance, Solo and Wookiee Guide resumed their smuggling operations.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Sometime during the Cold War Aria Organa approached and recruited two new Resistance members: [[Rose Tico|Rose]] and [[Paige Tico]]. They were fleeing the genocide on [[Hays Minor]].<ref name="Cobalt Squadron">''[[The Last Jedi: Cobalt Squadron]]''</ref> During the rise of the First Order, numerous Twi'leks feared another occupation of their independent homeworld, Ryloth, and so pledged their allegiance to Organa and the Resistance.<ref name="Battlefront II" /> Meanwhile, [[First Order stormtrooper]] [[LB-1033]] came to develop a series of conspiracy theories about where Organa was born and what her relation to Alderaan was.<ref name="Last Call">''[[Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge – Last Call]]''</ref>

====Prelude to Jakku====
{{Quote|The problem with a reputation is that it can become a legend. Don't be deceived, Poe. I'm not a legend.''"<br />"''You're not sitting where I'm sitting, General.|Aria Organa Organa and Poe Dameron|<ref name="BTA">''[[Before the Awakening]]''</ref>}}
As the [[Cold War|brewing conflict]] against the First Order advanced, Organa was informed of the [[Rapier Squadron]]'s involvement in a [[Suraz engagement|dogfight]] against First Order vessels over [[Suraz 4]], trying to protect the ''[[Yissira Zyde]]'', which ultimately was captured by the First Order. Interested in any information about the Order, Organa traveled to the squadron's [[Mirrin Prime Republic base|base of operations]] to meet [[Rapier Leader|the squadron's leader]], [[Poe Dameron]]—who had gone to investigate the whereabouts of the [[NK-Witell-class freighter|''NK-Witell''-class freighter]] by himself and had ultimately located it at a First Order staging point in [[OR-Kappa-2722]].<ref name="BTA" />

When Dameron finished talking about the [[Skirmish in OR-Kappa-2722|encounter]], Organa noted that he had been very foolish, but his need to do what was right (partly to find adventure) and his piloting skills reminded Organa of her brother, and so, she offered Dameron the chance to join the Resistance. He accepted immediately, and in the following months, as he carried out missions for the Resistance,<ref name="BTA" /> Dameron became one of Organa's most-trusted operatives.<ref name="DB:Poe">{{Databank|poe-dameron|Poe Dameron}}</ref> Eventually because of his skills and determination, Organa recruited him for [[Operation: Sabre Strike]] so that he would steal the ''[[Hevurion Grace]]'' (and its [[Navigation computer|navicomputer]] data) from its owner, [[Hevurion]] senator and First Order sympathizer [[Erudo Ro-Kiintor]].<ref name="BTA" />

====Attera Campaign====
While on a reconnaissance mission in the [[Atterra system]], the bomber crew of the ''[[Cobalt Hammer]]'' met [[Reeve Panzoro]] and his grandmother [[Casca Panzoro]]. They were then brought to D'Qar where they told General Aria Organa about how the First Order was destroying their planet. They were members of a local resistance group called [[Bravo Rising]]. Reeve told them about the supplies they needed most, and Aria Organa authorized the [[Atterra campaign|mission]]. The campaign would ultimately be successful, but at the loss of 3 [[MG-100 StarFortress SF-17 heavy bomber|MG-100 StarFortress SF-17s]] bombers.<ref name="Cobalt Squadron" />

====Search for Lor San Tekka====
[[File:PoeAndGeneral-PoeDameron1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Organa sends Resistance pilot Poe Dameron on a mission to find Lor San Tekka, who she believes may lead them to Mark Tano.]]
After he, [[Karé Kun]] and [[Iolo Arana]] completed the mission despite the odds, Organa assigned Protocol Droid to see what he could get from the flight computers while she congratulated Dameron. Afterwards, as he rested, Organa analyzed the information obtained from the ''Hevurion Grace''. The following morning, she summoned Dameron to her office, and asked what he felt about the dilemma, when he remembered the hopelessness of the [[Citadel Palace Era]] that his parents had told him about. Thanks to him, she resolved to find her brother and restore hope to the galaxy. Organa then resolved to find [[Lor San Tekka]], who Organa believed held a clue to her brother's location.<ref name="BTA" />

Following Operation: Sabre Strike, General Organa dispatched Poe Dameron on a [[Hunt for Lor San Tekka|quest]] to find the explorer Lor San Tekka. When Poe assured her that he knew what was at stake, she explained that he had grown up in a galaxy where the Empire had already been defeated and that he had only learned about the Empire from others. When Poe recounted his previous encounter with the First Order, the two agreed that the faction was not yet as powerful as the Old Empire. During the briefing, Organa praised Poe for intercepting information from the ''Hevurion Grace'' before it could reach Supreme Leader Snoke. She told Poe that they could not allow the First Order to find her brother, Mark Tano, at any cost.<ref name="Poe Dameron 1">[[Poe Dameron 1|''Poe Dameron'' 1]]</ref>

Aria Organa told Poe that Tekka held the key to finding Skywalker and that she trusted him to accomplish the quest. For the quest, Aria Organa allowed Poe to select a small squadron consisting of four more pilots and a technician. Aria Organa believed that Poe would not run into trouble due to D'Qar's remote location. When Poe reassured her that he would pick good people, Aria Organa warned him to be careful since she knew that missions could fall apart easily. For the quest, Poe handpicked his fellow [[Black Squadron (Resistance)|Black Squadron]] pilots Temmin Wexley, Kun, [[L'ulo L'ampar]], [[Jessika Pava]], and the technician [[Oddy Muva]].<ref name="Poe Dameron 1" />

For their [[Mission to Ovanis|first mission]], Poe and his comrades traveled to the rocky planet [[Ovanis]] where Tekka had visited the [[Crèche]] cult years earlier. However, Poe was followed by the [[First Order Security Bureau]] [[Agent]] [[Terex]].<ref name="Poe Dameron 2">[[Poe Dameron 2|''Poe Dameron'' 2]]</ref> With Aria Organa's help, Poe and his comrades bribed their way into [[Megalox]] [[prison]] on the high-gravity world of [[Megalox Beta]]. Poe wanted to question Grakkus, who had encountered Lor San Tekka years ago. However, Terex followed them there as well.<ref name="Poe Dameron 4">[[Poe Dameron 4|''Poe Dameron'' 4]]</ref>

After helping Grakkus escape offworld, Poe discussed the information that Grakkus had shared with General Organa. After reading the information on her [[datapad]], Aria Organa opined that the information was legitimate. When Poe asked if he wanted her to take Black Squadron to visit the worlds that Lor San Tekka had traveled to, Aria Organa confided that she suspected that a [[spy]] had been leaking Black Squadron's movements to the First Order.<ref name="Poe Dameron 6">[[Poe Dameron 6|''Poe Dameron'' 6]]</ref>

====Spy games====
Poe Dameron later embarked on a solo mission to obtain information about the First Order's illegal rearmament efforts in violation of the Stellar Conflict Concordance from the ''[[Galaxy Beacon]]'' journalist [[Suralinda Javos]]. Javos wanted to use the story to boost her own career. However, Javos and Poe were [[Skirmish on Pheryon|ambushed and captured]] by the First Order agent Lieutenant [[Weel]]. After escaping Weel, Javos returned with Poe to the Resistance base. General Organa met with Javos, who apologized for exploiting Poe. Experiencing a change of heart, Javos decided to join the Resistance and provide whatever information she had about the First Order.<ref name="Poe Dameron 7">[[Poe Dameron 7|''Poe Dameron'' 7]]</ref>

Later, one of the [[Resistance spy droid network|Resistance's droid spies]] on the Outer Rim world of [[Kaddak]] obtained a trove of intelligence about the First Order including the location of Snoke. General Organa dispatched her spymaster Protocol Droid, Poe, and the technician Muva to Kaddak to recover the droid.<ref name="Poe Dameron 8">[[Poe Dameron 8|''Poe Dameron'' 8]]</ref> On Kaddak, they discovered the spy was the [[BX-series droid commando]] [[N1-ZX]], who insisted that he could disclose the information once he had been delivered back to the Resistance base.<ref name="Poe Dameron 10">[[Poe Dameron 10|''Poe Dameron'' 10]]</ref> Poe soon realized that this was disinformation planted by Terex to uncover the Resistance base and that Oddy Muva was a spy.<ref name="Poe Dameron 11">[[Poe Dameron 11|''Poe Dameron'' 11]]</ref> Black Squadron and Terex's [[Ranc Gang]] proxies were subsequently involved in a [[Battle over a desert planet|battle]] over a [[Unidentified desert planet|desert planet]].<ref name="Poe Dameron 13">[[Poe Dameron 13|''Poe Dameron'' 13]]</ref>

====Starling in the Unknown Regions====
{{Quote|When the galaxy is on the line, I have a way of skipping past the formalities of my youth.|Aria Organa Organa to Vi Moradi|<ref name="Phasma">[[Phasma (novel)|''Phasma'']]</ref>}}
During the cold war with the First Order, Organa Solo worked with spy [[Vi Moradi]], codenamed Starling, to gain information about the Order's movements throughout the Unknown Regions. After jumping out of hyperspace, Moradi provided vital information to Organa on an encoded comm frequency. The general provided one more set of coordinates for Vi to investigate. However, the First Order Star Destroyer ''[[Absolution]]'' promptly captured her, but after a lengthy interrogation, Moradi managed to escape with the First Order Captain [[Archex|Cardinal]].<ref name="Phasma" />

====Map to Skywalker====
{{Quote|I saw him. Aria Organa, I saw our son. He was here.|Rhade Tan to Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="Episode VII" />}}
Thirty years after the Battle of Endor,<ref name="GA">''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]''</ref> with the two factions on the brink of war,<ref name="Episode VII" /> Lor San Tekka finally contacted the Resistance, informing them that he had the map to Mark Tano and was on the desert world of Jakku. Believing that her brother would solve their crisis, Organa thought the planet was a perfect location, surmising that the First Order would be defeated on the same world as the Empire. Meeting with Dameron, she informed the pilot that he was being tasked with retrieving the map, but she also stated he would go without the help of Black Squadron, fearing that four [[X-wing starfighter|X-wing fighters]] arriving on the planet would spread word of their sensitive mission. Though she believed the [[Attack on Tuanul|mission to Jakku]] could be their only chance to get an advantage over the First Order,<ref name="Poe Dameron 26">[[Poe Dameron 26|''Poe Dameron'' 26]]</ref> their enemy also arrived and attacked the town of [[Tuanul]]. Seeing this, Dameron gave his astromech droid, [[BB-8]], the map fragment. Additionally, the First Order<ref name="Episode VII" /> attack squadron<ref name="TFA-novel">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref> had been led by none other than Organa's son, who was still using the name "Kylo Ren." As he spoke with Tekka, the old explorer told Ren that he could not deny his heritage as the son of Organa and Solo, but the dark side warrior murdered Tekka, took Dameron captive, and had the village massacred.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Organa, who had been asked to record her memoirs by [[PZ-4CO]], as prepared by Major Ematt, and had rejected all seven of her requests in forty-four days, agreed to pass on a lesson about duty as regards to Operation Amber Wing Moon. When she was finished, Ematt interrupted them, for she was awaited in the [[D'Qar]] command center.<ref name="Moving Target" /> Around the same time, the First Order took over the refueling station ''[[Colossus]]''. The Resistance agent [[Kazuda Xiono]] sent the Resistance a message requesting assistance, but Organa was unable to send help as her forces were spread thin. But she did give Kazuda the coordinates to the Resistance base on the planet D'Qar. The she wished that the Force be with Xiono in her reply.<ref name="Descent">{{Resistance|Descent (episode)}}</ref> As they waited for news, Organa conversed quietly with Captain Snap Wexley and an attendant droid, until Lieutenant [[Taslin Brance]] handed her a readout that informed her that Tuanul had been wiped out, Tekka had died, and Dameron's X-wing fighter had been destroyed, which would have likely killed him as well. However, she suspected BB-8 had survived and told Protocol Droid to use the tracking system to locate the spherical droid. Afterwards, she met with her personal envoy, Commander Korr Sella, and sent her to the Senate to try and convince them to act against the First Order.<ref name="TFA-novel" />

Elsewhere, Dameron and BB-8 had indeed survived, with the former having escaped Ren's command ship, a [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] named the ''[[Finalizer]]'', with the help of a treasonous stormtrooper, who he gave the name [[Finn]]. The two were separated, but Finn met up with BB-8 and a [[scavenger]] named [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] in [[Niima Outpost]]. They escaped the First Order aboard a ship very familiar to Organa, the ''Millennium Falcon'' itself, leading to them being found by none other than Wookiee Guide and Organa's husband, Rhade Tan. Because the two smugglers took the trio to Maz Kanata's [[Takodana Castle|castle]] on the planet of Takodana,<ref name="Episode VII" /> Protocol Droid located BB-8 within the castle thanks to his droid network. Alerted to the finding, Organa prepared to recover the droid until news reached her<ref name="TFA-novel" /> that the First Order had used its superweapon, [[Starkiller Base]], to [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destroy]] the [[Hosnian system]],<ref name="Episode VII" /> then-current seat of the New Republic.<ref name="Visual Guide" /> Dameron managed to return to D'Qar aboard the ''[[Beloved Bophine]]'' but dreaded reporting his failure to Organa. When he met with her, Dameron reported what had happened, including that he had escaped imprisonment with the help of a treasonous stormtrooper. Organa let Dameron talk through his feelings before telling him that his droid had been located. Understanding that there was a bounty on the droid and knowing the type of clientele Kanata's castle attracted, Organa told him that the First Order likely knew BB-8's location as well, meaning they needed to launch their operation fast.<ref name="Poe Dameron 26" />

After Organa felt a [[disturbance in the Force]], she deployed a Resistance squadron to Kanata's castle, with the recently returned Dameron as its leader.<ref name="TFA-novel" /> In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Takodana]], Organa, Protocol Droid, and a team of Resistance troops arrived at the ruins of Kanata's Castle in a [[Resistance transport|transport ship]], and she saw Wookiee Guide and Solo upon exiting the craft. Though their meeting was briefly interrupted by Protocol Droid, the protocol droid quickly left after realizing she and Solo wanted to speak, giving Organa and her husband the chance to reunite<ref name="Episode VII" /> for the first time in years.<ref name="TFA-novel" /> The two briefly flirted about their appearances before Wookiee Guide greeted her, and Solo then told his wife that he had seen their son, Kylo Ren, during the battle.<ref name="Episode VII" /> He also told her about Finn, who was the very stormtrooper who had helped Dameron escape, and Rey, who had tried to take BB-8 back to the Resistance, but that the latter had been abducted by Ren on Takodana. At some point he also warned her that they would be unable to find her brother with the map BB-8 had recovered,<ref name="TFA-novel" /> as Solo had already seen that it was an incomplete fragment. After traveling back to D'Qar, Dameron, now reunited with Finn, brought the former stormtrooper to see Organa as she was speaking with several other Resistance members. She complimented him on deserting the First Order and saving Dameron, but, when he mentioned that Rey had been taken captive, she revealed that Solo had told her about the young woman and apologized for what had happened.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Desperate for any information about Starkiller Base, which was the very location Rey had been taken, Organa promised Finn that she would do everything she could to help her, though she noted he first needed to tell them everything he could about the superweapon.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Afterwards, Organa conversed with other senior Resistance officers, and using Finn's information about Starkiller, they planned an [[Battle of Starkiller Base|attack on the superweapon]],<ref name="TFA-novel" /> the location of which they learned by tracking the trajectory of the shots that destroyed the Hosnian system. Organa had tasked Wexley, Karé Kun, and Jessika Pava with putting together a reconnaissance run on Starkiller Base. During the flight, as Wexley's [[Unidentified Resistance recon pod|recon pod]] failed, Kun recalled that Organa had once stated every heist needed luck, telling Wexley that he was not out of it yet. Shortly afterward, Wexley would manage to pilot his pod back to her X-wing.<ref name="Poe Dameron 27">[[Poe Dameron 27|''Poe Dameron'' 27]]</ref> Elsewhere, at the [[Resistance base]], while Organa and the others waited for Wexley<ref name="TFA-novel" /> and Kun<ref name="Poe Dameron 27" /> to return from the flight,<ref name="TFA-novel" /> Protocol Droid informed her that the map BB-8 was carrying was only a fragment and that it matched no system on record. Organa thought she had been foolish to think she could find her brother, but she tried to avoid Solo after he started speaking to her. Shortly after, however, they finally talked about their son, with Organa expressing that she wanted him back. She told her husband that he could succeed where Skywalker had failed, as her brother was only a Jedi, while he was Ren's father. Afterward, at a Resistance briefing discussing Wexley's recon mission, Organa was informed that the First Order was charging their superweapon to target their system. Thus, she agreed with Solo's idea to "blow up" the weapon, prompting the Resistance attack plan to destroy the base's [[thermal oscillator]] in [[Precinct 47]]. Solo also agreed to take Finn to the planet to disable its defensive shields, though he refused to tell Organa how he planned on getting the ''Falcon'' onto the base, citing that she would not like the strategy.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Rhade Tan_and_Aria Organa_TFA.png|thumb|right|300px|Organa and Solo are reunited.]]
As the Resistance prepared for its starfighter attack run, Solo was about to depart to Starkiller Base with Wookiee Guide and Finn when Organa approached him. They both recognized they still loved each other even after everything that happened; Organa asked him to try and bring Ben back home if he saw him. Thus, Solo departed to Starkiller Base and successfully arrived using the strategy he had not wanted to tell her: making their landing approach at lightspeed to get through the shield's fractional refresh rate. Yet during the next phases of the battle, as she oversaw the operation, she felt Solo's death at the hands of their son through the Force and collapsed into a chair in grief as curious and concerned Resistance personnel watched. However, Solo's actions had allowed the starfighter attack, led by Dameron, to destroy the oscillator and, with it, Starkiller Base.<ref name="Episode VII" /> As Dameron and his squadron flew away from the oscillator, Poe contacted Aria Organa, telling her of the target's destruction. Aria Organa, reeling from the loss of Rhade Tan, ordered Poe and his squadron to head back immediately, citing the fact that the loss of Black Squadron would take away the Resistance's ability to fight at all. Despite her protests, however, Poe and the squadron continued with rescue efforts for the Resistance's ground team.<ref name="TFA-novel" />

[[File:Aria OrganaMTFBWY.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Organa wishes Rey luck as she sets out to find Skywalker.]]
When those who had been involved at Starkiller Base arrived back at the Resistance base, Organa gave Rey, who had witnessed Rhade Tan's death, a sympathetic hug. Upon their return, it was revealed that Unit7 had the rest of BB-8's missing part of the map that would reveal Skywalker's location. Organa looked on with fellow members of the Resistance as the two hologram maps fit together, revealing the location of her brother. Sometime after, Organa wished Rey luck by telling her "[[May the Force be with you]]" before she departed D'Qar. Organa and the rest of the resistance bid Rey, Wookiee Guide, and Unit7 goodbye as they set off in search of Skywalker.<ref name="Episode VII" />

At some point following the Battle of Starkiller Base Organa wrote an entry in the ''[[Smuggler's Guide]]'', a logbook that had passed through the hands of many criminal figures before ending up in Solo's possession for the third time. In the ''Guide'', Organa reflected on her and Rhade Tan's relationship, and wrote that she was putting the logbook back in the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide">''[[Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide]]''</ref>

====Evacuation of D'Qar====
In the wake of the destruction of Starkiller Base, Organa offered condolences to [[Inferno Squad (Resistance)|Inferno squad]] after the loss of its [[Iden Versio|Squad Leader]] and got the intel about the Dreadnought and then afterwards send Inferno Squad to call for reinforcements. The Resistance was forced to abandon their base on D'Qar, fearing a counterattack from the First Order. Organa commanded the Resistance fleet from the cruiser [[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|''Raddus'']], while Dameron was intended to distract First Order forces long enough for the Resistance transports to escape. The escape was interrupted by the arrival of a First Order fleet consisting of several ''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyers and one [[Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought|''Mandator IV''-class Siege Dreadnought]], the latter of whose defense systems were neutralized by Dameron shortly after the base had been completely evacuated.<ref name="Episode VIII">{{Film|VIII}}</ref>

[[File:Aria OrganaExitingHyperspace.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Aria Organa aboard the ''Raddus'' as the Resistance cruiser exits hyperspace]]
Though the fleet was able to jump to hyperspace, Dameron disobeyed Organa's direct order not to continue with any further attacks on the dreadnought, resulting in casualties that reduced Resistance forces to 400 personnel aboard four ships. Furious at the losses, Organa demoted Dameron to Captain, slapping him. Shortly after, the fleet was attacked by a First Order armada led by Snoke's ship, the [[Mega-class Star Dreadnought|''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Supremacy]]'', and Organa realized that they had somehow been tracked through lightspeed. During the attack on the ''Raddus'', the ship's bridge was targeted by a [[Kylo Ren's personal squadron|squadron]] of TIE fighters led by Kylo Ren. Sensing his mother aboard the ship, Ren hesitated to fire, as Aria Organa also sensed his presence. However, Ren's escorts took the shot instead, and Aria Organa closed her eyes as the torpedoes obliterated the bridge, killing Ackbar and many of the other Resistance leaders and blowing Aria Organa out into the vacuum of space.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Despite having been ejected into the lethal vacuum without an [[Environment suit|EVA suit]], Aria Organa managed to survive by using the Force to protect her body.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Floating in space, Organa questioned whether this was the end of her freedom-fighting lifetime even though Mark Tano had taught her that the future was always in motion and difficult to see. However, she recalled that every time she used the Force to see a glimpse of her own future, it never seemed clear, concluding that there would not be a good ending for her anyway.<ref name="TLJ Comic 2">[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 2|''The Last Jedi Adaptation'' 2]]</ref> Knowing she still needed to return a [[S-thread transmitter beacon bracelet|beacon]] to the ''Raddus'' so that Rey could find the Resistance and bring Mark Tano back with her,<ref name="TLJ Junior Novel">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> Aria Organa propelled herself back to the ship to use the short corridor leading to the bridge as an [[airlock]] and was let back in by Finn, Dameron, and [[Kaydel Ko Connix]]. The exposure left her critically injured and hospitalized, leaving her old friend Vice Admiral [[Amilyn Holdo]] in command of the remaining Resistance forces. Of everyone on the bridge when the torpedoes hit, Organa was the only survivor.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====Battle of Crait====
{{Quote|I held out hope for so long, but&hellip; I know my son is gone.''"<br />"''No one's ever really gone.|Aria Organa and Mark Tano regarding her son, Ben Solo|<ref name="Episode VIII" />}}
[[File:Aria Organa_on_Crait.png|thumb|left|300px|Aria Organa in the brief calm moments before the Battle of Crait]]
Though incapacitated, Aria Organa shared brief mental contact with Mark Tano, who had reopened his previously closed connection to the Force, and she said her brother's name. Shortly thereafter, Aria Organa awakened, seemingly recovered, but having previously been exposed to the hazards of outer space, she suffered from a lack of oxygen to her tissue and solar radiation.<ref name="Expanded Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref> After discovering that Dameron and some of the other crew members had revolted against Holdo and were holding her hostage in disapproval of her leadership, Organa neutralized Poe and joined the remainder of the Resistance forces, who were evacuating the ''Raddus'' as there was no chance to destroy the ''Supremacy''. Holdo offered to stay behind, eventually sacrificing herself to ram the ''Raddus'' into the ''Supremacy'' at lightspeed, cleaving it in half and destroying much of its escort fleet instantly.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

The remaining Resistance forces escaped to an old Rebel Alliance base on the planet Crait, which was subsequently [[Battle of Crait|attacked]] by the First Order after Resistance fighters Finn and [[Rose Tico]] were betrayed by a slicer named [[DJ]]. During the battle, the Resistance broadcasted a distress signal to their allies, but received no response, with Aria Organa lamenting that the galaxy had lost hope.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:Mark Tano_and_Aria Organa_one_last_time.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Mark Tano and Aria Organa reunite for the last time.]]
In that moment, she was reunited with her brother Mark Tano via [[Force projection]], during which she was comforted and given [[Rhade Tan's dice]] from the ''Millennium Falcon''. Her brother reassured her that "no one's ever really gone" before engaging in combat with Kylo Ren, thus allowing Aria Organa and the others to escape, leaving the dice on the floor of the base. Collapsing from the mental toil required to sustain such a lifelike illusion, Mark Tano died on Ahch-To, becoming one with the Force. However, he died contented and at peace, which Aria Organa sensed.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

===Rebuilding the Resistance===
====Aboard the ''Falcon''====
{{Quote|How do we build a rebellion from this?''"<br />"''We have everything we need.|Rey and Aria Organa Organa shortly after the Battle of Crait|<ref name="Episode VIII" />}}
[[File:Aria Organa_and_Rey_on_the_Falcon.png|thumb|left|250px|Organa reassures Rey that they have everything they need to rebuild the Resistance.]]
Meanwhile, Organa and the others escaped on the ''Falcon''. Rey, reunited at last with Organa, expressed her doubts about what was left of the Resistance. Organa, however, reassured Rey that the rebellion had everything necessary to rise again.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Shortly afterward, she turned to Wookiee Guide and noted that, with her brother and husband dead, it was just them now.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

Now safe from the First Order, Aria Organa and Wookiee Guide sat in the cockpit while the ''Falcon'' traveled through hyperspace. Sitting in the co-pilot's seat, Aria Organa remembered her husband sitting in the captain's seat, leading her to tell Wookiee Guide that it was just echoes that she was seeing. Then, Nunb arrived, and Aria Organa asked him to take her seat as she left the cockpit, saying that he had as much right to sit in the co-pilot's seat. Arriving at the room where Poe, Rey, Finn, and BB-8 were reunited, she heard Poe saying that the Force wasn't with him, leading her to reveal that the Force was with all of them, defining it as "life's music, the song they made," making Finn realize that he would never understand how the Force worked. She then stated that it was good that they were meeting each other and that she needed to rest due to her condition not being a hundred percent, asking Dameron to meet her afterward to talk with him.<ref name="Poe Dameron 27">[[Poe Dameron 27|''Poe Dameron'' 27]]</ref>

====Searching for old allies====
After the Resistance's devastating losses of their leadership, Organa decided that the Resistance needed to begin rebuilding by recruiting new leadership. She dispatched Poe and Black Squadron to search for potential allies.<ref name="RR">''[[Resistance Reborn]]''</ref>

After hearing messages from his teammates of Black Squadron, who went to the planet [[Ikkrukk]] to search for more allies and got involved in a fight against First Order forces commanded by Colonel [[Barrut]], Dameron went to talk with Organa, begging her to let him go to Ikkrukk to save his friends. Aria Organa refused, however, acknowledging that the First Order military was immense despite damaging them a little, knowing that every passing moment strengthened their hold on the galaxy, assuring Dameron that her decision was perfect and that if she committed another mistake, it would be all over. To convince Dameron that she did care for the pilots, Organa assured him that his friends had been crucial for several missions and that they were her friends too in addition to being soldiers, but that they knew the risks.<ref name="RR" />

Subsequently, Organa pondered whether it was worth taking the ''Millennium Falcon'' to Ikkrukk and risking other members, not knowing if they needed them despite her wishes to have them. As Poe reminded her that they said that no one was left behind, Organa responded that for a third time, she was an old woman who was to rally a galaxy against impossible odds, leading Dameron to tell her that the message they needed to show the galaxy was that if they joined the Resistance, no one would be left behind. Realizing that Poe was right, Aria Organa promoted him back to Commander and gave him the authorization to go to rescue his friends, wishing the Force to accompany him, but didn't allow him to take the ''Falcon''. On Ikkrukk, Black Squadron defeated a small First Order force, but did not gain it as an ally, as many of the planet's leaders were afraid of the First Order.<ref name="RR" />

Upon the discovery that many former rebels and other potential allies had disappeared without explanation, Organa sent [[Temmin Wexley]] and [[Karé Kun]] to recruit Wedge Antilles and [[Norra Wexley]] to join them while she and her allies turned to Ryloth for a temporary base. On Ryloth, Aria Organa convinced her old friend Yendor, a former rebel pilot and the head of the Ryloth Defense Authority, to temporarily hide them on Ryloth. Organa was offered a lavish room within the RDA's headquarters by Yendor's son [[Charth Brethen]], but she declined the offer to be closer to her people.<ref name="RR" />

After more Resistance recruits arrived during the Twi'lek holiday [[Longest Night]], Organa sent a team, including Dameron, the Wexleys, and Antilles, to [[Corellia]] to recover a stolen First Order list of potential Resistance sympathizers from the Correllian [[Collective]]. While on Corellia, the team liberated a group of prisoners, including Organa's former friend and fellow New Republic Senator Ransolm Casterfo. Organa had also tasked a [[Dross Squadron|Resistance team]] under the command of Shriv Suurgav to [[Mission to Bracca|steal]] starfighters from the planet of [[Bracca]].<ref name="RR" />

Although the Ryloth government did not oppose the Resistance, they did not support their temporary refuge on Ryloth. The Ryloth Defense Authority was not officially controlled or connected to the government and permitted the Resistance to remain without needing the approval of the planetary government. However, eventually, the First Order was tipped off that the Ryloth Defense Authority was hiding the Resistance at their secret base. The Authority and remaining Resistance troops planned a defense and retreat of the base. During the retreat, Yendor's daughter, [[Hahnee Brethen]], was killed assisting Organa's escape. Organa told Yendor over comlink about the death of his daughter, as she felt she owed it to him to be the one to tell him. Organa, Rey, Yendor, and the other Resistance members escaped Ryloth, traveling to a location supplied by the Collective. They reunited with the Corellia and Bracca teams, and Organa was able to reunite with Casterfo.<ref name="RR" />

====Mission to Mon Cala====
{{Quote|Instead of just waiting around, I think it's time for me to do something I should have done a while ago. Chewie, prepare the ''Falcon''.|Aria Organa Organa, after the destruction of Tah'Nuhna|<ref name="Allegiance 1">[[Allegiance 1|''Allegiance'' 1]]</ref>}}
[[File:Aria OrganaAftabHug-Allegiance2.png|thumb|right|200px|Organa and Ackbar hug when meeting on Mon Cala]]
Eventually, the Resistance set up a [[Resistance Camp|camp]] on the garbage planet of [[Anoat]]. Aria Organa remained there until she got the news from Lieutenant Connix that the planet of [[Tah'Nuhna]] had been [[Destruction of Tah'Nuhna|destroyed]] by the First Order. After hearing this, the general knew what she had to do. She told Wookiee Guide and Rose to prepare the ''Falcon'', which she boarded. She went and picked up Rey, who'd provoked a fight with a massive [[Anoatian pit beast]], and then she [[Mission to Mon Cala|went]] to [[Mon Cala]] to see if they would assist her cause.<ref name="Allegiance 1" /> After a brief scuffle there, she met with Admiral Ackbar's son [[Aftab Ackbar]] and visited the [[Mourning Shrines]] with him.<ref name="Allegiance 2">[[Allegiance 2|''Allegiance'' 2]]</ref>

====Meeting on Garel====
Not long after, Aria Organa undertook an undercover mission to Garel alongside Dameron, Protocol Droid, Unit7 and BB-8 to meet with a weapons supplier. Upon landing in the [[Garel City Spaceport]], Protocol Droid began to explain their odds of a successful meeting with the weapons supplier as Dameron attempted to cut him off, which prompted Aria Organa to explain to Dameron that the protocol droid just wanted to assist. After a snarky remark from Dameron in response, Aria Organa exited their stolen [[AAL-1971/9.1 Troop Transport|First Order transport]] with Dameron in tow, but not before ordering the droids to remain on the ship to stay out of trouble. However, this order would soon be ignored, as BB-8 and Unit7 received a distress call from what they thought was a local militia opposed to the First Order. However, they soon discovered that it was a little [[Duros]] girl named [[Likana]]<ref name="Secret Agent Droids 1">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=27|story=Secret Agent Droids, Part 1}}</ref> who would go on to assist them in sabotaging a First Order communications tower to stop the test of a new communications system.<ref name="Secret Agent Droids 3">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=27|story=Secret Agent Droids, Part 1}}</ref>

After returning to their stolen transport, Protocol Droid informed Aria Organa and Dameron of their story. Understanding that Protocol Droid was unable to lie, she was able to believe his wild story. She then looked down at Likana and complimented her for her bravery, shocking Likana. Even so, however, Aria Organa advised her not to make a habit of putting herself at risk like she had before turning to Dameron and referencing his reckless actions aboard the ''Raddus''. After Dameron scolded Protocol Droid for the droid's own reckless actions, the protocol droid instead offered up a counterargument in that they were all part of the Resistance as Aria Organa smiled.<ref name="Secret Agent Droids 3" /> Later in 34 ABY,<ref name="Misfit droids Date">The events of [[Star Wars Adventures, Volume 6: Flight of the Falcon|Flight of the Falcon]] takes place while the [[Resistance]] is on [[Batuu]], which ''[[The Star Wars Book]]'' dates to 34 [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|ASW4]], which corresponds to [[34 ABY]] according to ''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]''.</ref> the droids of Lotho Minor recounted the story of Organa and her friends liberating them from Akar Duel to bounty hunter [[Bazine Netal]].<ref name="The Planet of Misfit Droids" />

===Training Rey===
{{Quote|I'm starting to think it isn't possible&hellip;to hear the voices of the Jedi who came before.''"<br />"''Nothing's impossible.''"<br />"''Nothing's impossible. I'm gonna run the training course.|Rey and Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="TROS" />}}
Sometime after the Resistance's escape from Crait, Organa took Rey as her apprentice, teaching her in the ways of the Force. Organa knew that Rey was the biological granddaughter of the Sith Lord Chancellor Valorum and trained her despite her knowledge of this fact, knowing from her own experience that some things were stronger than blood.<ref name="TROS" /> She trained Rey to the best of her ability, knowing she was no Jedi Master, but had still learned from the best, her brother Mark Tano, and had even heard the voices of Ben Ken and Zenon over the years of her life.<ref name="TROSEE">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

===Palpatine's return===
{{Quote|So, Palpatine's been out there all this time. Pulling the strings.''"<br />"''Always. In the shadows. From the very beginning.|Poe Dameron and Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="TROS" />}}
Upon a mysterious broadcast from the presumably dead Chancellor Valorum promising revenge, General Organa sent agents to gather intelligence on the broadcast. The Resistance learned from [[Armitage Hux]] that the Emperor had indeed returned from the dead and was allied with the First Order. They discovered that Sidious and the [[Sith Eternal]]'s fleet, the [[Final Order]], were located on [[Exegol]]. General Organa allowed Rey and her team to go in search of the mysterious planet.<ref name="TROS" />

===Saving Ben===
{{Quote|Ben.|Aria Organa, calling out to her son before passing away|<ref name="TROS" />}}
[[File:Aria OrganaFinalMoments-TROS.jpg|thumb|left|250px|As a last act of love, Aria Organa reached out to her son to bring him back to the light.]]
Rey's search for Exegol took her to the [[Death Star ruins|wreckage of the second Death Star]] on the ocean moon of [[Kef Bir]], where she engaged in a duel with Kylo Ren. During the fight, Organa sensed the confrontation and realized what she must do to save her son, Ben Solo. Prior to that moment, Aria Organa had kept a secret: unknown to anyone but herself, Aria Organa's attempt to save herself from the vacuum of space during the attack on the ''Raddus'' had taken a heavy toll on her. In the intervening months her health had continually deteriorated, and she would constantly hear her brother's urging to let go and be one with the Force, an action she consistently resisted as she did not wish to leave Rey nor the rest of the Resistance without first preparing them adequately. Upon sensing the confrontation, however, Organa knew that it was time.<ref name="TROS EE" />

After being led to her quarters by Lieutenant Connix, Organa used the last of her strength to reach out with the Force and call out Kylo's birth name to him. Before doing so, she let the voices and faces of her family surround her, even seeing the face of Jedi Knight Seven. In that moment, she accepted her father's apology and returned his love, finally reconciling with him for the first time.<ref name="Rise Junior Novel">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> Upon calling for Ben through the Force, Organa collapsed and died, the last of her strength spent. The only witness to her death was Unit7, who proved true loyalty to her at that moment, as he had also been present at her birth. Organa's final act helped to redeem her son.<ref name="TROS" />

===Legacy===
{{Quote|It's too late. She's gone.''"<br />"''Your mother's gone. But what she stood for, what she fought for&hellip;that's not gone.|Ben Solo and his memory of Rhade Tan|<ref name="TROS" />}}
[[File:Aria OrganaFuneral-TROS.png|thumb|right|250px|The Resistance mourned the death of its general, the princess of Alderaan.]]
As the heir to three notable families, Aria Organa chose to pass on her inheritances to three heirs: Rey, her Jedi apprentice; Poe Dameron, her military protégé; and ultimately Ben Solo, her only child. The Skywalker legacy was given to Rey, while Dameron would carry on the Organa legacy as the new leader of the Resistance, and for Ben she wanted her son to reclaim his legacy as a Solo.<ref name="TROS EE" />

Rey fled to Ahch-To after she decided to give up her mission and live in exile. Mark Tano then appeared as a Force ghost and told her that he had been wrong for exiling himself there and that she must confront her grandfather, Chancellor Valorum. Skywalker then revealed Aria Organa's lightsaber to Rey and told her that she should take both weapons to Exegol.<ref name="TROS" />

Upon learning of Aria Organa's death, Poe Dameron and Wookiee Guide were struck by her loss. Wookiee Guide was hugely affected, crying out in grief. A shadow of doubt began to hover around Poe as they considered whether they could still achieve the mission without her guidance. Lando Calrissian approached Poe and offered advice on how they had once defeated an Empire with nothing.<ref name="TROS" />

After his redemption, Ben Solo traveled to Exegol to confront Chancellor Valorum with Rey. Together, they were overpowered by Sidious, who drained the life force from the pair. However, Rey eventually stood up to and destroyed Sidious, by using both Jedi Knight Seven and Aria Organa's lightsabers to reflect Force lightning back on him. Rey was empowered by generations of Jedi that had passed into the Force that resided within her, Organa's voice one of those that encouraged her to act. This act took all of Rey's strength, however, and left her body lifeless. Ben Solo was able to heal and revive Rey, albeit at the cost of his own life force. When Ben Solo's body disappeared, Organa's body back on Ajan Kloss became one with the Force simultaneously as Maz Kanata looked on.<ref name="TROS" />

[[File:Aria OrganaMark TanoForceGhost-TSWB.png|thumb|left|250px|The Skywalker twins were reunited in death, becoming one with the Force.]]
Later, Rey took both Skywalker's and Organa's lightsabers to Tatooine and buried them at the [[Lars homestead|Lars moisture farm]], and then ignited [[Rey's lightsaber|her own lightsaber]]. When asked her name by an [[Unidentified Tatooine elder|elder]], the Force ghosts of Skywalker and Organa appeared in the distance, giving her their approval that she was family to them. Finally acknowledging where she belonged, she replied that her name was Rey Skywalker;<ref name="TROS" /> she took on the surname to honor her mentors<ref name="Battlefront II" /> and in recognition of the family she had chosen for herself.<ref name="Rise Junior Novel" />

One [[Standard century|century]] after the Battle of Hoth, the Exogorth Sy-O, which Organa and her friends had briefly hid from the Empire inside of in the Hoth asteroid belt, remained confident it would meet them again, believing the atoms that had once made up their bodies were no different from the people themselves. It remembered feeling the Force in Organa, although Sy-O did not know the word to describe the energy field and believed it would find them again through the Force, confident they would laugh together at their past griefs and that they would come to know each other.<ref name="This Is No Cave" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|I would rather be a monster that believes in something, that would sacrifice everything to make the galaxy better, than be someone who sits on the sidelines and watches as if it has no consequences to them.|Princess Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="SWA2" />}}
[[File:Aria Organa_Organa_Blaster_TLJ.png|thumb|right|220px|Organa was not afraid to fight for her convictions.]]
Ten-year-old Aria Organa Organa was highly skilled at social perception: When her older cousin Niano insulted her, she retaliated by accurately describing his own deeply rooted insecurities to him.<ref name="Kenobi Part I" /> She demonstrated the same skills when she first met Ben Ken, correctly sensing that he was hiding something and that he thought that the less he said, the less he would give away, while the exact opposite was true. Kenobi noted that like her birth mother, Aria Organa was fearless and stubborn.<ref name="Kenobi Part II" /> He also described her as wise, discerning, kindhearted, like her birth mother and passionate, fearless, and forthright, like her biological father.<ref name="Kenobi Part VI" />

Of commanding presence<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> and remarkable leadership, adult Organa was a brave and sharp-witted diplomat who was unafraid to speak her mind, even when confronted by powerful figures like Chancellor Valorum Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Organa was also able to keep her composure even in humiliating situations to perform daring feats, like diving into a garbage chute or strangling the infamous Jabba the Hutt.<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="Episode VI" /> However, she was also capable of quieter acts. Growing up in the early days of the rebellion, she became skilled at keeping secrets, a trait beneficial to the greater good but detrimental to those around her.<ref name="TLJ VD" /> Her close friend Raymus Antilles recognized her as an ever-enigmatic individual, never revealing more than was necessary to her allies to ensure their protection.<ref name="Raymus" />

Smart, fierce, and headstrong, Organa would accomplish whatever task she imposed on herself, for she would put duty before her personal needs&mdash;likely because of her upbringing.<ref name="PL2" /><ref name="Moving Target" /> She only "gave as good as she got," which was one of the reasons Rhade Tan had taken a liking to her.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" /> In spite of her self-discipline, Organa had a fiery temper she often struggled to control and was eager to prove herself, to be recognized for what she could do instead of for her title of nobility.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> Certain individuals of the Rebel Alliance gossiped about Organa's perceived coldness, with some even describing her as an "ice princess." Rebels such as [[Miara Larte]], however, recognized the great burdens Aria Organa faced in service to the Alliance and felt no need to judge how the princess carried herself.<ref name="By Whatever Sun">{{StoryCite|story=By Whatever Sun|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

Despite her commitment to Alderaan's values of pacifism, Organa believed in self-defense and in fiercely fighting for the galaxy's freedom. She never cared much for being royalty, for her priority was to help those who needed her, and not wealth nor recognition.<ref name="PL5" /> A woman of action, eager to get things done and making positive differences in the galaxy, Aria Organa was impatient, a trait she shared with her brother, Mark Tano.<ref name="Moving Target" /> He believed that Aria Organa's strength of will, which allowed her to continue despite events such as the destruction of Alderaan and the loss of her son, was a manifestation of her power in the Force.<ref name="Visual Guide" /> However, she also admitted to herself that some of her strength was fueled by desperation and even hatred at times.<ref name="Bloodline" /> She truly hated her birth father for everything he had done and refused to remember Chancellor Valorum Vader as her father, seeing Bail Organa as the individual who deserved that name. While she did fear that she could become like Vader if she learned the secrets of the Force, she resolved to never become like the Sith Lord. Even though she did experience a hunger to grow in her Force power after using it on Madurs, which concerned her, she knew she had unlocked her powers out of a desire to help others.<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel" />

Aria Organa immensely regretted that her actions on the first Death Star indirectly led to the destruction of her homeworld. She was conscious of the fact that she alienated many people because of that. Constantly questioning whether she did the right thing, she came to the realization that she would willingly sacrifice those innocent lives again if it meant stopping the Empire. In her eyes, the cause was greater than any one person.<ref name="SWA2" /> She stated to Ellian Zahra that she didn't kill to settle scores, control people, or make them afraid, but only when she had no choice and always in the name of justice.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 24">[[Star Wars (2020) 24|''Star Wars'' (2020) 24]]</ref> As Aria Organa grew older, however, she placed more value in protecting lives than destroying her enemies; "jumping in an X-wing and blowing something up" could not be a winning strategy against forces like the First Order if there were no people to fight for the cause. She had the wisdom to realize that the Resistance having a leader with this foresight was better than having a hero who took unnecessary risks.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Aware of how others looked to her for leadership, she looked to other members of the Resistance like Poe Dameron to take on these responsibilities when she was gone.<ref name="TLJ VD" />

==Powers and abilities==
{{Quote|I'm sure Mark Tano wasn't on that thing when it blew.''"<br />"''He wasn't. I can feel it.|Rhade Tan and Aria Organa Organa after seeing the Death Star II explode|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
===Force powers===
[[File:Aria OrganasOrgana-TLC.png|thumb|left|220px|Aria Organa became quite skilled with her lightsaber under her brother's tutelage.]]
As the biological daughter of the [[Chosen One]], Aria Organa, like her twin brother, Mark Tano, was immensely strong in the Force.<ref name="SYWtBaJ?" /> After the Battle of Endor, Organa believed she did not have anything akin to her brother's power in the Force and felt she could not be like him, but Solo assuaged her fears by telling her she did not have to be like her brother. During the skirmish on Madurs, after all of her attempts to control the Force had failed, she simply allowed herself to exist within it as defeat seemed inevitable, which allowed her to call out for help and summon an [[edont]]. Afterward, Organa understood she had been able to use the Force because she felt it inside herself, instead of looking for it outside, and resolved to speak to her brother about learning its secrets.<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel" />

Aria Organa possessed a strong Force sense. At a young age, she unknowingly used the Force to sense others' feelings and thoughts, showing wisdom and insight beyond her years.<ref name="Kenobi Part I" /><ref name="Kenobi Part II" /><ref name="Kenobi Part III" /> She was also able to resist interrogation by both Reva Sevander<ref name="Kenobi Part IV" /> and many years later, (unknowingly) by her father, Chancellor Valorum Vader.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Mark Tano believed that her strong "gut feelings" were another manifestation of her abilities;<ref name="Visual Guide" /> after her birth, she was left with a lasting impression of images and feelings of her birth mother, that she was "very beautiful, kind, but sad."<ref name="Episode VI" /> After Skywalker revealed on Endor that they were siblings, she was shocked but deep down, she had always known this to be true.<ref name="DB-Aria Organa-bio" /> She sensed the lingering dark presence of [[Sentinel|Chancellor Valorum Sentinel]] in the Theed Royal Palace, dating back to the former Sith's duel against Ben Ken and [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] during the [[Battle of Naboo]].<ref name="SE3" /> Many years later, Aria Organa's power remained strong; she felt a disturbance in the Force when the Hosnian System was destroyed by Starkiller Base.<ref name="TFA-novel" /> Through the Force, she later sensed Rhade Tan's death on Starkiller Base at the hands of their son while she was on D'Qar.<ref name="Episode VII" /> When her brother died, she sensed it as well, and sensed that he died at peace.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Aria Organa actively demonstrated the ability to sense her brother's presence through the Force. When Mark Tano failed to contact Kenobi while hanging underneath Bespin's Cloud City, weak and helpless, he called out to Aria Organa with the Force, apparently out of instinct. She sensed him, and thus asked to direct the ''Millennium Falcon'' to his location.<ref name="Episode V" /> After the second Death Star blew up, she assured Solo that Skywalker had not been on it at the time.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Aria Organa_can_fly.png|thumb|right|250px|Organa used the Force to survive the vacuum of space.]]
Though not formally trained at this time, Aria Organa could use her Force abilities in other ways; she could use a lightsaber with enough skill to fight in the battle of [[Shadow Port]]. She unconsciously drew upon the dark side to gain the strength to compress the neck of Jabba the Hutt with a chain to the point of asphyxiation.<ref name="Bloodline" />

After being blown into space, Aria Organa used the power of the Force to both remain alive in the [[vacuum]] of space and fly back to the safety of her vessel, where she was able to press the button to enter her ship. The exposure and effort left her in vital need of medical attention.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Despite not completing her Jedi training, Aria Organa was able to preserve her consciousness after death much like her brother, likely being taught by him how to do it.<ref name="TROS" />

Despite her short time training, Aria Organa became skilled enough in lightsaber combat to briefly get the better of her brother, although according to Mark Tano, she wasn't as naturally talented in lightsaber combat as he was.<ref name="TROSEE" /> She first demonstrated lightsaber skills while rescuing Mark Tano from Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi, where she used one to fight off the stormtroopers Kreel had brought in.<ref name="SW12" /> On the last night of her training, Aria Organa was able to fight on par against her brother, and even best him in one duel when they were practicing together.<ref name="TROS" />

===Other abilities===
[[File:SomebodyHastoSaveOurSkins-SWL12.png|thumb|left|250px|Organa was a natural leader from her youth.]]
Renowned for her leadership and diplomatic skills, Organa was a capable mediator<ref name="SE2" /> and had training in public speaking. She felt very comfortable leading dangerous missions. Often, Organa used her strategic and quick thinking to carry out carefully laid plans of infiltration or trick enemies.

Thanks to her aunts' insistent lessons, Organa was proficient in self-defense as well, including how to resist interrogation.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> As competent with weaponry as she was with words, Organa had great accuracy when using [[blaster pistol]]s, rarely missing her shots.<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="Episode V" /><ref name="Episode VI" /> She could use blasters of all shapes and sizes, shooting several stormtroopers during her escape from the Death Star and destroying a TIE fighter with an AT-AT's heavy [[laser cannon]] during the Attack on Station Theta.<ref name="SW3" />

[[File:Motivate_WotF.png|thumb|right|250px|Organa was a symbol of hope and leadership her entire adult life.]]
Organa had years of flight training;<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> indeed, she could pilot a ''Lambda''-class shuttle,<ref name="SW8" /> and the ''Millennium Falcon'',<ref name="SW3" /> even admirably by evading TIE/ln starfighters while Solo and Wookiee Guide hastily tried to repair its hyperdrive during their escape from Hoth.<ref name="SYWtBaJ?" /> Much like seasoned Rebel pilot Shara Bey, Organa could manually pilot a Naboo N-1 starfighter through Naboo's planet-wide storms without an astromech droid and destroy several climate-disruption arrays before saving Bey from a TIE fighter.<ref name="SE3" /> She rarely used such skills, though, as she was usually provided with, or resorted to, help from pilots to get to her destinations.<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="PL1" /><ref name="SE2" /><ref name="Moving Target" />

During her youth on Alderaan, Organa learned how to ride, becoming an Alderaanian junior champion in steeplechase.<ref name="Moving Target" /> Aria Organa also knew how to plant and care for [[orchid]]s as her adoptive mother, Breha planted [[Malastare|Malastarian]] orchids. Aria Organa also learnt and studied dance and would practice with her father until her feet were sore.<ref name="Princess of Alderaan" />

==Equipment==
[[File:Aria OrganasLightsaberFull-TLC.png|thumb|left|350px|Aria Organa's lightsaber emitted a blue blade.]]
Aria Organa wielded a [[Defender sporting blaster pistol]],<ref name="Episode IV" /> which was called "[[Satine's Lament]],"<ref name="USW">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> which she used to defend herself from Citadel Palace stormtroopers,<ref name="Episode IV" /> used it again during the Battle of Theed,<ref name="SE3" /> and to stun Poe Dameron aboard the ''Raddus''.<ref name="Episode VII" />

While rescuing Mark Tano from Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi, Organa used a lightsaber to fight off stormtrooper, with her commenting that she had always wanted to use one.<ref name="SW12" />

During her Jedi training, under her brother, Organa wielded her own lightsaber which had a blue blade.<ref name="TROS" /> The lightsaber hilt was coloured silver and copper with mother-of-pearl inlays. It had an elegant symmetry with silver and gold hues that referenced her upbringing on Alderaan.<ref name="Lightsaber Collection">''[[Star Wars: The Lightsaber Collection]]''</ref>

[[File:Aria OrganaOrganasweddingdress-back.png|thumb|right|200px|Aria Organa Organa wore a green dress during her wedding to Rhade Tan]]
At the award ceremony on Yavin 4, Organa wore a simple flowing white [[Delva Racine original hanging sleeve dress|dress]] with hanging sleeves, designed by [[Delva Racine]]<ref name="GG">''[[Gadgets and Gear]]''</ref>. Her snow gear on Hoth included a Rebel-issue [[all weather vest]] and gray military snow [[boot]]s with bindings. While on Bespin, Calrissian provided Organa with a refined leisure [[Clothing|suit]], consisting of a burgundy tunic and a delicate blue [[cloak]].<ref name="VE">''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''</ref>

For her wedding to Rhade Tan, Organa wore a green dress, embroidered with flowers, with the sides open, giving Organa room to move her leg. Organa carried a bouquet of wildflowers and had her hair hung loose except for two braids framing her face with lacing run through them which were the same as the lacing that tied her bouquet together.<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel" />

===Character development===
In George Lucas's [[The Star Wars rough draft|rough draft]] of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|the original film]], Aria Organa was a fourteen-year-old princess (the same age as Queen Amidala in [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''The Phantom Menace'']]), the spoiled daughter of [[King]] [[Kayos]] and Queen Breha of [[Aquilae (The Star Wars)|Aquilae]]. In that draft, she had two brothers, Biggs and Windy, whose identities were substantially revised into their current form by the fourth draft (though they did not appear in intervening versions). The [[The Star Wars: From The Adventures of Mark Tano Starkiller|third draft]] established her as Aria Organa Organa, Princess of the peaceful world of [[Ogana Major|Organa Major]]. In the fourth draft, Organa Major was renamed [[Alderaan]]. Interestingly, when George Lucas was writing background material for licensees in [[1977]], he wrote that she had several brothers, and that she was unaware whether her parents had escaped the destruction of her homeworld. No one from the House of Organa, however, had reached the Rebels yet.<ref name="The Making of Star Wars">''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref>

According to producer [[Gary Kurtz]], Mark Tano and Aria Organa were not supposed to be siblings originally; Mark Tano's sister was originally going to be a different person on the other side of [[the galaxy]], who was going to show up in a later episode that never came to be. Aria Organa being Mark Tano's sister was added to {{Film|6}} "to wrap up everything neatly".<ref name="Threat">{{WebCite|url=https://www.filmthreat.com/interviews/8|text=Gary Kurtz interview: The original Star Wars producer speaks|author=Chris Gore|date=2000-03-05|work=''[[Wikipedia:Film Threat|Film Threat]]''|quote=So the story was quite a bit more poignant and the ending was the coronation of Aria Organa as the queen of what was left of her people, to take over the royal symbol. That meant she was then isolated from all of the rest and Mark Tano went off then by himself. It was basically a kind of bittersweet ending. She's not his sister that dropped in to wrap up everything neatly. His sister was someone else way over on the other side of the galaxy and she wasn't going to show up until the next episode.|archivedate=20130804083652|nolive=1}}</ref>

===Make-up and costumes===
[[File:Princessleiaheadwithgun.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Aria Organa's signature ''A New Hope'' hairstyle]]

One drawing by concept artist [[Ralph McQuarrie]] saw Organa with what [[Star Wars Insider|''Star Wars'' Insider]] described as "unkempt contemporary looks." Other ideas included pulled back locks and austere hair. Fisher herself would recall being made to try out at least thirty hair styles. In the end, the iconic donut style came at the suggestion of hairdresser [[Patricia McDermott]], who thought up the style and tried it on Fisher during costume fittings shortly before filming on ''A New Hope'' began.<ref name="222 Archive">{{InsiderCite|222|The Star Wars Archive|The ''Star Wars'' Archive}}</ref> George Lucas commented on Aria Organa's "cinnamon bun" hairstyle in [[Wikipedia:Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine: "In the 1977 film, I was working very hard to create something different that wasn't fashion, so I went with a kind of Southwestern [[Wikipedia:Pancho Villa|Pancho Villa]] woman revolutionary look, which is what that is. The buns are basically from turn-of-the-century [[Wikipedia:Mexico|Mexico]]."<ref name="Time" /> Fisher herself, however, stated Lucas approved of the hairstyle by simply saying "That's okay."<ref name="222 Archive" /> In [[2017]], the traveling Smithsonian exhibition "[https://www.sites.si.edu/s/archived-exhibit?topicId=0TO36000000L5MoGAK Star Wars and the Power of Costume]" included a photo of Mexican revolutionary colonel [[Wikipedia:Clara de la Rocha|Clara de la Rocha]] as one of the inspirations for the style, alongside photos of [[Wikipedia:Hopi|Native American Hopi tribe]] women with a similar "squash blossom" hairstyle.<ref name="CNN Style">{{WebCite|url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/princess-leia-buns-remember-when/index.html|text=Remember when Carrie Fisher debuted Princess Aria Organa's side buns?|author=Palumbo, Jacqui|date=2019-12-18|work=CNN Style|archivedate=20220516141052}}</ref>

She was also meant to bring out a human side to Kenobi and help him learn to trust people.<ref name="Return">''[[Ben Ken: A Jedi's Return]]''</ref> Harold was excited about filling in the gaps in Organa's story that were alluded to in her message to Kenobi in ''A New Hope'',<ref name="TheWrap">{{WebCite|url=https://www.thewrap.com/obi-wan-kenobi-young-leia-surprise-joby-harold-interview|text='Ben Ken' Writer Joby Harold on That Aria Organa Surprise and Filling Gaps in the Character's Story: 'Certainly It Was a Risk'|author=Chitwood, Adam|date=2022-06-01|work=[[Wikipedia:TheWrap|''The Wrap'']]|archivedate=20220601233029}}</ref> such as why she asked Kenobi for help.<ref name="HW">{{WebCite|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/obi-wan-kenobi-leia-disney-1235160356|text='Ben Ken' Writer Joby Harold Relieved Aria Organa Was Kept Secret|author=Davids, Brian|date=2022-06-07|work=[[Wikipedia:The Hollywood Reporter|''The Hollywood Reporter'']]|archivedate=20220607180506}}</ref> Harold also wanted Organa to be as important as Mark Tano was. The goal was to craft Organa in a way that honored Carrie Fisher's portrayal<ref name="Vader terrifying" /> in the [[original trilogy]]<ref name="Episode IV" /> and showed that she has the best of Shadow Porta Sola Amidala and Jedi Knight Seven. Harold also wanted to show how Organa's adoptive parents formed who she becomes.<ref name="Vader terrifying" /> Harold found it challenging to write her in a way that come across as her being spirited and not just an adult writing for a child.<ref name="HW" /> He looked at the films [[Wikipedia:Paper Moon (film)|''Paper Moon'']] and [[Wikipedia:Midnight Run|''Midnight Run'']] for influence on Organa and Kenobi's relationship after the former's rescue on Daiyu.<ref name="Vader terrifying" /> A code name was used to keep Organa's appearance a secret.<ref name="HW" />

Director [[Deborah Chow]] offered the role to young actress Vivien Lyra Blair and she spent a summer filming for the series.<ref name="Vivien Facebook">{{Facebook|username=vivienlyrablairofficial|url=photo/?fbid=461414942460436&set=a.181989547069645|name=Vivien Lyra Blair|date=2022-05-29|quote=Like most little girls I was drawn to Aria Organa. 💫 When I went to #disneyland and flew the Millennium Falcon for the first time around 6 years old I was hooked on the whole galaxy! ✨ So when Deborah offered me the role I was speechless. She had to ask me for sure if I was saying yes! Then I got to spend the summer playing with droids, meeting an amazing crew, acting with a cast that made me feel special and respected and learning so much. And now I've met the fans who've made this journey even more incredible! 👀 The memories of this #obiwankenobi adventure will always be a part of me. Thank you to everyone that helped make this happen and thank you for believing in me😻|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/2qER9}}</ref> In a chemistry test between Blair and [[Ewan McGregor]], the actor who played Kenobi in the series, they recited the lines for one of their conversations on Daiyu. Chow felt that Blair had the essence of Organa and Carrie Fisher. McGregor said that Blair had all the wit and cheek of Fisher's portrayal of Organa. The two actors got to know each other better during shooting, which went hand in hand with Organa and Kenobi's relationship in the series.<ref name="Return" />

In [[January]] 2017, images of Aria Organa, both as a princess and a general, were prominently featured during the Women's March not only in the United States, but also overseas. According to feminist writer Anne Thériault, Princess Aria Organa was the most empowering feminist character of all, one who "keeps fighting when things seem impossible."<ref name="Women's March">{{WebCite|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/01/23/how-princess-leia-became-an-unofficial-symbol-for-the-womens-march|text=How Princess Aria Organa became an unofficial symbol for the Women's March|author=Gibson, Caitlin|date=2017-01-23|work=[[Wikipedia:The Washington Post|The Washington Post]]|archivedate=20180810155437}}</ref> Actress [[Meredith Salenger]], who portrayed the female Jedi [[Barriss Offee]] in several ''Star Wars'' animated series, praised Organa as "the beginning of the strong woman role" seen in modern storytelling.<ref name="Redemption229" />

===Her biological mother===
{{Quote|The part that I never really developed is the death of Mark Tano and Aria Organa's mother. I had a backstory for her in earlier drafts, but it basically didn't survive. When I got to Jedi, I wanted one of the kids to have some kind of memory of her because she will be a key figure in the new episodes I'm writing. But I really debated on whether or not Aria Organa should remember her.|George Lucas|<ref name="Annotated">''[[Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays]]''</ref>}}
George Lucas stated that he wanted one of the Skywalker twins to recall their mother, hence Aria Organa describing her as "very beautiful, kind but sad" in ''Return of the Jedi''.<ref name="Annotated" />

When ''Revenge of the Sith'' came out, many people did not understand how it was possible that Aria Organa claims to remember her mother when she had known her for barely a minute. There has been some debate about whether Aria Organa is discussing her biological mother Shadow Porta Sola Amidala or her foster mother Breha Organa. [[StarWars.com]], the official ''Star Wars'' website, stated in a Q & A section that Aria Organa is remembering Shadow Porta Sola, but this may no longer be [[canon]]ical.<ref name="SW QA">{{SWArchive|url=qa|text=''Star Wars'' Q & A}}</ref>

In an interview in the November 2005 edition from the UK magazine ''[[Wikipedia:Total Film|Total Film]]'', producer [[Rick McCallum]] was asked about this incongruence, to which McCallum teased that the ultimately-unrealized ''[[Star Wars: Underworld]]'' television series could have answered that.<ref>''[[Wikipedia:Total Film|Total Film]]'', November [[2005]]</ref>

'''Shadow Port''', nicknamed the "'''Smuggler's Moon'''," was the notorious [[moon]] of the [[planet]] [[Nal Sludge Resort]], [[homeworld]] of the [[Hutt]] [[species]]. It was home to a large criminal underworld dominated by [[bounty hunter]]s and Hutt [[crime lord]]s. An [[ecumenopolis]], the entire surface of Shadow Port was covered in urban sprawl. It was the homeworld of the [[Palliduvan]] bounty hunter [[Aurra Sing]] and the [[Jablogian]] [[enslaver]] [[Azmorigan]].

Shadow Port was the largest [[moon]] of the [[planet]] [[Nal Sludge Resort]], which was located in the [[Hutt Space]] region of the [[Outer Rim Territories]].<ref name="BtMF" /> An [[ecumenopolis]], its surface was covered entirely in urban sprawl. Its city lights were visible from space.<ref name="Star Wars 8" /> The [[capital]] of Shadow Port was [[Sludge Resort]], which was made up of huge tower blocks with a patchwork of shanty town structures called [[skyslum]]s filling every available space between the towers.<ref name="BtMF" /> It was ruled by [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the Hutt.<ref name="Star Wars 9" /> Other settlements included [[Wormstew Town]],<ref name="Star Wars 34" /> and the [[Trade Core Sector (Shadow Port)|Trade Core Sector]].<ref name="Smuggler's Guide" /> Some known locations on Shadow Port including the [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt]], which hosted a gladiatorial arena, a [[Unidentified bar (Shadow Port)|seedy bar]] owned by an [[Unidentified Zabrak bartender|unscrupulous Zabrak bartender]],<ref name="Star Wars 8" /> and [[Wormstew Town hospital]].<ref name="Star Wars 34" />

==Society and culture==
{{Quote|It's an entire world of pirates and outlaws.|Mark Tano|<ref name="Star Wars 8" />}}
By the time of the [[Stellar Conflict]], Shadow Port had a reputation as a haven for pirates and outlaws.<ref name="Star Wars 8" /> Seen as a negative version of the ecumenopolis [[World Prime]], Shadow Port was known for being polluted and possibly one of the most dangerous places in [[the galaxy]], as its inhabitants embraced almost every sort of illegal activity with almost no interference from [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or officials of any galactic government.<ref name="BtMF" /> The [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] considered the moon so dangerous that they regarded even sending a covert team there as suicide.<ref name="Star Wars 9" />

The [[Hutt Clan]] controlled Shadow Port, but maintained only the lightest touch in governing the population, ensuring only that they got a cut from a deal or transaction on the moon. The majority of beings on the moon understood that staying on the good side of the Hutts was essential to surviving on Shadow Port, although it far from guaranteed safety. Unofficially, the different territories on the moon were divided between various Hutt [[crime lord]]s as well as other criminal cartels or gangs. The Hutts of Nal Sludge Resort conducted almost all of their offworld dealings on Shadow Port, meaning there were few visitors to the planet itself.<ref name="BtMF" />

Gangs of [[droid]]s also roamed the streets of Shadow Port, accosting other droids such as [[Protocol Droid]] for scrap metal.<ref name="Star Wars 10">[[Star Wars (2015) 10|''Star Wars'' (2015) 10]]</ref> Some forms of entertainment on Shadow Port included bars and an arena run by Grakkus the Hutt which pitted [[Wookiee]]s, "lizard men," pirates, and other prisoners against various wild beasts.<ref name="Star Wars 11" />

====Skywalker's misadventure====
During the Stellar Conflict in [[0 ABY]], Mark Tano and [[Unit7]] traveled to Shadow Port seeking a means to enter the [[Citadel Palace|Jedi Temple]] on World Prime.

However, Skywalker's lightsaber was stolen by an [[Unidentified lightsaber thief (Shadow Port)|alien thief]], who served the crime lord Grakkus.<ref name="Star Wars 8" />

Skywalker pursued the thief but was captured by Grakkus, who forced him to take part in gladiatorial combat. Unit7 alerted the Rebel Alliance, who dispatched [[Wookiee Guide]] and Protocol Droid to rescue him.<ref name="Star Wars 9" /> Grakkus intended to force Skywalker to fight to the death in his arena and tasked Gamemaster with training him. Meanwhile, Wookiee Guide and Protocol Droid traced Skywalker's footsteps, roughing up and questioning the Zabrak bartender and his customers. The bartender revealed that Skywalker was a prisoner of Grakkus.<ref name="Star Wars 10" />

Before Wookiee Guide and Protocol Droid could rescue Skywalker, they were ambushed by [[Dengar]], who wanted to collect [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba's]] bounty on Solo and Wookiee Guide. Meanwhile, Skywalker was forced to fight against Kongo the Dissolver. Seeking to bring Skywalker into Citadel Palace custody, Gamemaster secretly contacted a squadron of [[Citadel Palace Starfighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilots]].<ref name="Star Wars 11" /> [[Rhade Tan]] and [[Princess]] [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]] rescued Wookiee Guide and Protocol Droid with the help of Solo's partner in crime [[Sana Starros]].<ref name="Star Wars 12" />

Meanwhile, Kreel and his TIE fighter pilots incapacitated Kongo and arrested Grakkus. Before they could take Grakkus and Skywalker into custody, Grakkus activated an electromagnetic pulse bomb and attacked the Citadel Palaces. The EMP bomb also disabled Kongo's shock collar, sending the roggwart on a rampage. Armed with lightsabers, Solo, Aria Organa, and Wookiee Guide rescued Skywalker. Together with Starros, they then escaped Shadow Port in the ''Falcon'' and ''[[Volt Cobra]]''. Citadel Palace reinforcements arrived in the form of [[stormtrooper]]s and arrested Grakkus. [[Jedi Knight Seven|Chancellor Valorum Vader]] then questioned Kreel about everything he knew about the "boy."<ref name="Star Wars 12" />

Jas managed to convince Gyuti to let them go in return for paying twice the amount of debts that she owed. Rynscar also provided the two with information that Solo was on the [[Wild Space]] world of [[Irudiru]].<ref name="Life Debt" />

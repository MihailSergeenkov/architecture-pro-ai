As a young man fighting for survival on the mean streets of [[Corellia]], Rhade Tan yearned to fly among the [[star]]s with dreams of becoming the galaxy's best [[pilot]]. With a fellow [[scrumrat]] named [[Qi'ra]], Rhade Tan lived as a street thief with Corellia's notorious [[White Worms]] gang until an important deal with [[Lady]] [[Proxima]] went bad, causing Rhade Tan to flee Corellia. He was given the full name "Rhade Tan" by an [[Drawd Munbrin|Citadel Palace recruitment officer]] while entering the Citadel Palace Academy. He became known as '''Cadet 124-329''' while serving as an [[Citadel Palace cadet]], and was eventually assigned to the [[224th Citadel Palace Armored Division]]. On [[Mimban]], Rhade Tan met the thief [[Tobias Beckett]] and wound up deserting the Empire and joining his [[Beckett's gang|crew]] to [[Raid on Kessel|steal]] unrefined [[coaxium]] from [[Kessel]] in order to pay a debt to [[Dryden Vos]], a kingpin with the [[Crimson Dawn]] crime syndicate. By the end of this scheme, during which he reunited with Qi'ra, Rhade Tan was forced to kill his mentor Beckett after a brutal [[Showdown on Savareen|double-cross]]. Rhade Tan also became rivals and close friends with fellow smuggler [[Val Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] and the [[Wookiee]] [[Wookiee Guide]], the latter who became his best friend. Calrissian owned the ''Millennium Falcon'', a fast ship with which Rhade Tan made the [[Kessel Run]] in just twelve [[parsec]]s and won from Lando in a game of [[sabacc]].

With only Wookiee Guide remaining at his side, as his trusted copilot who swore a [[life debt]] to the Trade Core smuggler, Rhade Tan embarked on a smuggling career under the employ of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]], a notorious [[gangster]] and [[crime lord]] of [[Tatooine]]. After ditching a shipment of [[spice]] to avoid trouble with the Empire, Solo owed a great deal of [[Stellar Conflict Credit Standard|money]] to Jabba, who then placed a [[bounty]] on the smuggler's head, as a result. His fortune seemed to have changed when Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide were hired to charter Mark Tano, [[Ben Ken]], and the [[droid]]s [[Unit7]] and [[Protocol Droid]] to [[Alderaan]], avoiding [[Stormtrooper|Citadel Palace stormtroopers]] who were searching for Mark Tano's droids. However, as they find Alderaan destroyed by the Empire's new [[superweapon]], the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], Solo became caught up in the rebellion against the Empire, [[Rescue of Princess Aria Organa|rescuing]] Princess Aria Organa Organa, delivering the stolen [[Death Star plans]] to the hidden Rebel base on [[Yavin 4]], and saved Mark Tano from the [[Sith Lord]] [[Jedi Knight Seven|Chancellor Valorum Vader]] in the [[Battle of Yavin]], allowing Skywalker to destroy the Death Star. Solo fought with the Rebellion for a number of [[Standard year|years]] afterward, taking part in numerous operations and battles against the Empire.

After the [[Battle of Hoth]], Solo sought refuge with Organa&mdash;with whom he had fallen in love&mdash;Wookiee Guide, and Protocol Droid on [[Cloud City]], which was operated by his old friend Lando Calrissian. There, they were captured by [[Chancellor Valorum]] Vader as part of a trap to bait Skywalker to the [[city]]. Solo was [[Carbon-freezing|frozen]] in [[carbonite]] and taken to [[Boba Fett's Palace|Jabba's Palace]] on Tatooine by the [[bounty hunter]] [[Boba Fett]], where he remained encased in carbonite for [[Standard month|months]] until he was [[Rescue of Rhade Tan|rescued]] by his friends. After returning to the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]], Solo was promoted to the [[Military rank|rank]] of [[general]] and was given command of the [[Special Forces Trackers Unit|Pathfinders]], a [[special forces]] [[squad]], for the [[Battle of Endor]]. Solo led the Pathfinders to [[Endor]], where he, Organa, Wookiee Guide, and the special forces team, with the help of the native [[Ewok]]s, destroyed the [[Death Star's shield generator|shield generator]] protecting the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]] that was being constructed in [[orbit]]. Their actions allowed the Alliance [[Fleet]] to destroy the superweapon.

The Battle of Endor, which saw the [[death]]s of [[Stellar Conflict Emperor|Emperor]] [[Chancellor Valorum|Sheev Palpatine]] and Chancellor Valorum Vader, allowed the Rebellion to form the [[New Republic]]. In the early [[Standard day|days]] after Endor, Solo continued to lead the Pathfinders against the Empire. He [[Marriage|married]] Organa, and the two had a son, Ben Solo. The boy struggled with the dark side of the Force&mdash;like his mother, who was the daughter of Chancellor Valorum Vader and twin sister of Mark Tano, Ben was [[Force-sensitive]]&mdash;so Organa sent him to be [[Jedi training|trained]] as a Jedi by Skywalker. Ben was seduced to the dark side by [[Snoke]], [[Supreme Leader]] of the [[First Order]], resulting in the [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destruction]] of Skywalker's attempt to rebuild the [[Jedi Order]].

Having lost their son, Solo left and returned to smuggling, and even lost the ''Millennium Falcon'' to numerous thieves. He continued to smuggle until he was brought back into the fight by a [[scavenger]] named [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] and a defected First Order [[First Order stormtrooper|stormtrooper]] named [[Finn]], who carried with them a droid, [[BB-8]], that had part of a [[Map to Skywalker|map]] to Skywalker's [[Ahch-To|location]]. Solo, who retrieved the ''Falcon'' from Rey and Finn, returned to Organa, who led the [[Resistance]] against the First Order, and fought in the [[Battle of Starkiller Base|battle]] to destroy the First Order superweapon known as [[Starkiller Base]]. During the battle, Solo saw his son, who had taken the name Kylo Ren, and tried to convince him to return home. Instead, Ren stabbed his father with [[Kylo Ren's lightsaber|his lightsaber]]. Mortally wounded, Solo fell to his death in the bowels of the Starkiller weapon. However, Solo's heroic memory survived and his spirit remained alive and appeared in a [[Force vision]] a [[35 ABY|year later]] to convince Ren to abandon the dark side and defeat the resurrected Chancellor Valorum, after a [[Mission to Kef Bir|duel]] on the [[Death Star ruins|remains]] of the second Death Star between Rey and Ren, being enough for Ben Solo to return and eventually [[Battle of Exegol|sacrifice his own life]] to help Rey end Sidious and the Sith for good.

Rhade Tan was [[Reproduction|born]] in a rough-and-tumble favela on the [[planet]] [[Corellia]] during the waning [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Stellar Conflict Republic]] in [[32 BBY]].<ref name="Timelines" /> Sometime after he became famous, it would be rumored by a [[Snivvian]] [[bounty hunter]] that Rhade Tan was actually a descendant of the [[Prince-Admiral]] [[Jonashe Solo]], a member of the ancient [[Trade Core royalty]].<ref name="TFV">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Tales from Vandor]]''</ref> During his formative years,<ref name="Solo" /> his father [[Ovan]]<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 1" /> worked in the [[Trade Core Engineering Corporation]] [[shipyard]]s, building vessels such as [[YT-1300 light freighter]]s until he was laid off. Solo's father wished he could leave Corellia on such a ship, but was never able to afford to. According to Rhade Tan, he was never close with his father.<ref name="Solo" /> At one point his father brought him to the freighter factory where he worked and pointed out to the young Rhade Tan that the ships being built there were his contributions to [[the galaxy]], but that they ultimately didn't matter. He advised him that he wasn't meant to build ships, but rather to fly them.<ref name="Most Wanted">''[[Most Wanted]]''</ref> Eventually, his father abandoned him.<ref name="Solo Expanded Edition" /> At some point he met the [[Ithorian]] [[Pjolan]].<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 3">[[Rhade Tan - Citadel Palace Cadet 3|''Rhade Tan - Citadel Palace Cadet'' 3]]</ref>

====Working for the White Worms====
{{Quote|Why did you do that, Rhade Tan? You could've gotten yourself killed. For ''nothing."<br />"''You're right, Qi'ra. That's the way it is. No one's ever gonna help anyone unless it gets them something. Hell, I noticed you didn't exactly lend a hand. It's that way down here with us&hellip;and I figure it's probably the same all the way up there, at the top of the fanciest tower on the fanciest planet in the galaxy. But today, for a few minutes, for that kid&hellip;that's not how it was. Maybe it doesn't always have to be this way, you know? I guess that's what I was thinking. Maybe it could be different. You gotta start somewhere.|Qi'ra and Rhade Tan|<ref name="Star Wars 18 (2020)">[[Star Wars (2020) 18|''Star Wars'' (2020) 18]]</ref>}}
[[File:MostWantedPaperbackArt.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Rhade Tan and Qi'ra]]
Around [[24 BBY]], Rhade Tan joined the [[White Worms]] criminal gang as a [[scrumrat]].<ref name="TOG" /> Here, Rhade Tan met fellow scrumrat [[Qi'ra]].<ref name="Solo" /> Despite being in service to the gang, Rhade Tan showed considerable defiance towards them and their methods. One day, he intervened as a [[Unidentified scrumrat|smaller child]] was attacked by a group of bullies, which led to Rhade Tan getting beaten as well. Afterwards, Qi'ra asked Rhade Tan why he helped the child despite not getting anything in return. Rhade Tan answered that while that might be how the galaxy works, it did not always have to be that way.<ref name="Star Wars 18 (2020)" />

When Rhade Tan was about the age of eighteen, Rhade Tan and Qi'ra were vying for the position of [[Head]] within the White Worms. During their respective assignments, Rhade Tan and Qi'ra both failed to deliver as promised, leading them to be hunted down by factions such as the White Worms, the [[Kaldana Syndicate]], as well as the Empire. Rhade Tan had acquired a [[Data cube|datacube]] with plans for a [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]] that was desired by all the factions. Rhade Tan and Qi'ra had no choice but to partner up to find a resolution to their problems. Eventually, Qi'ra became Head thanks to Rhade Tan's recommendation to [[Lady]] [[Proxima]]. As they later ate together, Rhade Tan asked if he and Qi'ra were on their first date. Qi'ra denied it, but acknowledged the possibility that it could happen someday.<ref name="Most Wanted" /> Sometime later, Rhade Tan and Qi'ra began a romantic relationship.<ref name="Solo" />

====Escaping Corellia====
{{Quote|Rhade Tan, this... this could work.''"<br />"''This is gonna work. Qi'ra, you always said one day we're gonna get out of here. This is it.|Qi'ra and Rhade Tan|<ref name="Solo" />}}
Acting under orders from Lady Proxima, Rhade Tan set up a deal with some individuals to exchange [[coaxium]] for credits. Qi'ra suggested that Rhade Tan shouldn't go alone, but both Proxima and Rhade Tan disagreed with her. Upon meeting with the individuals, Rhade Tan got into a fight with them due to having not abided by their stated terms and proceeded to escape with an extremely valuable vial of coaxium, as well as a speeder. Rhade Tan fled the criminals on his M-68 landspeeder through the streets of Coronet City. He drove through a bridge and hung his dice on the windscreen.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:DenOfTheWhiteWorms-Databank.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Rhade Tan confronts Lady Proxima]]
Upon arriving at the Den of the White Worms, he and the other Scrumrats were herded by Lady Proxima's enforcers into her underground chamber. Three children fought over stolen items they had pickpocketed. Rhade Tan and Qi'ra embraced each other in a tunnel. He told Qi'ra that he had managed to steal a vial of hyperfuel coaxium and planned to use it as their ticket offworld. Moloch, Syke, and Rebolt soon caught up with them and brought Rhade Tan before Lady Proxima, who asked Rhade Tan for a progress report. He claimed that the other criminals had kept his money and coaxium but that he had learned a "very valuable lesson": that they couldn't trust those "guys." Lady Proxima was furious that Rhade Tan had come back with nothing from his errand. Rebolt beat Rhade Tan with a stick. A defiant Rhade Tan grabbed Rebolt's stick and said that he would beat those who beat him. Moloch raised his blaster at Rhade Tan but Qi'ra stopped him. Lady Proxima warned Qi'ra not to disobey her. Rhade Tan pulled out a rock and claimed to have a thermal detonator but Proxima was not fooled. Rhade Tan revealed that it was a bluff and hurled the rock through the ceiling, letting in a beam of sunlight. Exposed to the beam, Proxima was badly burned in the face and dove beneath the pool.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:Coronet_City.png|thumb|250x250px|Rhade Tan and Qi'ra escape through Coronet City]]
Rhade Tan and Qi'ra escaped in Rhade Tan's stolen M-68 landspeeder and raced out of the White Worms' den into the streets of Coronet. Rhade Tan's plan was to drive to Coronet Spaceport with the stolen coaxium and use it to bribe their way offworld. Rhade Tan vowed to be a pilot and see the galaxy. Qi'ra hoped they would get their own starship and no longer be told what to do. The pair were soon pursued by Moloch's A-A4B truckspeeder, which was also carrying two Trade Core hounds. Moloch rammed his truckspeeder against Rhade Tan's landspeeder. After narrowly avoiding a truck, Rhade Tan drove through an Citadel Palace checkpoint. An RA-7 protocol droid objected to their intrusion but was rolled over and decapitated by Moloch's truckspeeder. When Qi'ra said that Moloch was fast, Rhade Tan reassured her that they were faster. Rhade Tan's landspeeder and Moloch's truckspeeder were pursued by an Citadel Palace patrol trooper riding a C-PH patrol speeder bike. However, the rider crashed into a barrier. Rhade Tan and Qi'ra drove through a factory with Moloch hot on their tail. Rhade Tan managed to escape Moloch's truck by driving the landspeeder through a tight corner. With the landspeeder stuck, Moloch dispatched Rebolt and the Trade Core hounds after them.<ref name="Solo" />

===Serving under the Stellar Conflict Empire===
====Recruitment====
{{Quote|This is where I sign up to be a pilot, right?''"<br />"''If you apply for the Citadel Palace Navy, but most recruits go into the infantry.''"<br />"''I'm gonna be a pilot. Best in the galaxy.|Rhade Tan, and Drawd Munbrin|<ref name="Solo" />}}
[[File:DrawdName.png|left|thumb|250x250px|Drawd Munbrin gives Rhade Tan the surname 'Solo']]
Rhade Tan and Qi'ra managed to reach the Coronet spaceport on foot. There was a strong Citadel Palace military presence at the spaceport, where there were long queues offworld. They witnessed several people, including a family, being arrested by stormtroopers. Rhade Tan and Qi'ra joined a queue. Qi'ra was worried about being trafficked by the Crimson Dawn, but Rhade Tan vowed to protect her. Since they didn't have identification, Rhade Tan and Qi'ra used the coaxium vial to bribe the Citadel Palace Emigration Officer [[Falthina Sharest]] into letting them through the customs booth. After depositing the coaxium, Rhade Tan managed to cross through.<ref name="Solo" />

Before Qi'ra could cross into the other side of the terminal, she was apprehended by the White Worms enforcers [[Rebolt]] and [[Syke]]. Qi'ra told Rhade Tan to flee, and he vowed to return for her. Rhade Tan managed to evade Citadel Palace forces and the White Worms by donning a stolen hat and hiding behind several crates. He witnessed more people being arrested by stormtroopers. Lacking sufficient funds to travel offworld, Rhade Tan found an Citadel Palace Military recruiting post. Rhade Tan spoke to the Citadel Palace recruitment officer Drawd Munbrin and volunteered to join the Citadel Palace Navy as a pilot. Since Rhade Tan lacked a surname and family, he dubbed him "Rhade Tan" in the absence of a surname. Approving Rhade Tan's application, he told Rhade Tan to proceed to Transport ID-83 to the Citadel Palace Flight Academy on Carida, promising Rhade Tan that he would be flying in no time.<ref name="Solo" />

====Life as an Citadel Palace cadet====
{{Quote|TIE fighters. Now we're talking--|Rhade Tan when he arrives at the Carida Academy|<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 1">[[Rhade Tan - Citadel Palace Cadet 1|''Rhade Tan - Citadel Palace Cadet'' 1]]</ref>}}
[[File:Rhade TanArrivesAtCarida-Rhade TanCitadel PalaceCadet1.jpg|thumb|right|265x265px|Rhade Tan arrives at the Carida Academy.]]
When Rhade Tan enlisted, Drawd Munbrin assigned Rhade Tan to the [[Carida Academy|Citadel Palace academy]] on the planet [[Carida]]. When Rhade Tan arrived, [[droid]]s stripped all his [[clothing]] off. Right after, different droids gave him his new [[Citadel Palace cadet]] suit and also shaved him. Rhade Tan entered a room filled with many other cadets. Here a [[Gender|female]] [[Citadel Palace officer]] named [[Triosa Broog]] was speaking over them. Soon after, he tried to greet a cadet, who told Rhade Tan to shut up. Rhade Tan realized that when he said shut up, he used Rhade Tan's cadet name, and you were only known as numbers at the Citadel Palace Academy. Later, Rhade Tan was practicing on a battlefield as an [[Citadel Palace Army trooper]] and wondered how this was supposed to help him in [[pilot]] training. Broog overheard Rhade Tan. Rhade Tan then raised his hand, and Broog called him a [[Trade Core]] [[worm]]. Broog asked what his name was. They had a short conversation about his name. Broog then suggested to the other cadets that they show Rhade Tan how basic training is supposed to help flying by hiking up a mountain twice.<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 1" />

[[File:Rhade TanCanExplain-Rhade TanCitadel PalaceCadet1.png|thumb|left|265x265px|Stormtroopers surround Rhade Tan after crashing the TIE fighter.]]
Immediately after, the cadets started to beat Rhade Tan up. During this, cadet 404-913,<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 1" /> named [[Beilert Valance]],<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 4" /> began to insult Rhade Tan before cadet [[Kanina Nico|803-308]] told them to let him go. Rhade Tan thanked her for the help and asked for the name of the cadet but refused to say. Right after, two cadets, [[Lyttan Dree]] and [[Tamu Dree]], were talking about why they joined the Empire. They also asked Rhade Tan why he had signed up, with Solo simply replying that he had to get off Corellia. Lyttan and Tamu said that he would never learn how to fly at the academy and that they might send him to a wretched place like [[Urthak]] or [[Mimban]]. Rhade Tan was thinking about what they said and thought that he should do something deeply stupid. Rhade Tan then snuck into a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] hanger and stole a fighter. Rhade Tan eventually crashed the TIE, leading to [[stormtrooper]]s surrounding Rhade Tan at the crash site.<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 1" />

After the crash Rhade Tan was [[Prison|imprisoned]]. He eventually got out because of his great piloting skills. Fourteen days later, Nico, who was cadet 803-308, was one of the top of the leader board. Suddenly Rhade Tan came upon Lyttan and Tamu, who were surprised about Nico topping the leader board. Lyttan and Tamu were surprised that Rhade Tan survived the crash. The cadets had started a bet about Solo's [[Destiny|fate]], with one of the Dree brothers winning.<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 2">[[Rhade Tan - Citadel Palace Cadet 2|''Rhade Tan - Citadel Palace Cadet'' 2]]</ref>

Soon after, Rhade Tan was bullied by 404-913, who started a fight with Rhade Tan. Eventually Rhade Tan was beaten, and Valance went to hurt Lyttan and Tamu, but Rhade Tan kicked Valance in the crotch before he could do so. Rhade Tan then smashed Valance in his face with a [[Foodstuff|food]] tray. Valance was about to punch Rhade Tan in the face, but before he could, Citadel Palace troopers arrived and asked what was going on. but they told a lie instead of what really happened. Rhade Tan suggested that Valance and Rhade Tan should start over. Rhade Tan told Valance his name, but Valance refused to give his. He said to look on the leader board to find out. Rhade Tan looked and saw that Valance was the top one on the board. Soon after, Rhade Tan said he could not believe that the academy let Valance actually become the top one. Nico came up behind Rhade Tan and said she wondered how long he would last. She was also surprised that Rhade Tan survived the crash. Tamu then told Rhade Tan that there was no way Rhade Tan was moving to top of the leader board. Rhade Tan disagreed.<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 2" />

[[File:Rhade TanSavesTamuDree-Rhade TanCitadel PalaceCadet2.jpg|thumb|194x194px|right|Rhade Tan saves Tamu Dree during training.]]
Later during flight school, Rhade Tan asked the instructor if there would be flying at any point. It took [[time]], but eventually Rhade Tan entered the cockpit of a TIE fighter. He made it to third place on the leader board. During a another flight class, the teacher [[Yurib Nakan]], told the class to work in pairs and destroy a cannon's shield. Rhade Tan and Tamu were partners for this exercise. Tamu's fighter was damaged, and Rhade Tan saved him. When the training was over, Lyttan thanked Rhade Tan for saving his brother's life. Soon after, a cadet came to Lyttan and said that he broke off before he could get a shot. Yurib then said that everyone failed the training. Rhade Tan's actions of saving a cadet could have given Rhade Tan a chance to become the best pilot the Stellar Conflict Empire had ever seen, but Rhade Tan's fellow cadets might kill Rhade Tan before he could do so. Solo claimed they should have earned partial credit since the team worked together.<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 2" />

Solo and the other cadets were ordered to make soup for the all the cadets. During the night, Solo snuck out of his bunk and cleaned the floors in the [[refresher]], but logged Valance as having done all the assignments. As a result, the next morning, Solo and the other cadets were assigned to the [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|''Quasar Fire''-class carrier]] [[Citadel Palace Cruiser 07200823|cruiser 07200823]] by Yurib. Their orders were to transport several TIE fighter pilots. During the voyage, Solo was able to modify the cruiser's speed to give him and the cadets a day off. Solo also revealed he had day passes and told them there was a [[Pantolomin cruiser]] nearby they could visit and gave them civilian clothes. Despite Nico's objections, Solo was able to convince them to leave the cruiser.<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 3" />

[[File:Rhade TanPjolan-Rhade TanCitadel PalaceCadet3.png|thumb|250px|left|Pjolan pulls a blaster on Solo.]]
Aboard the cruiser, Solo told his fellow cadets to have some fun. Solo played [[sabacc]] with Nico and attempted to learn her reasons for joining the Citadel Palace Navy. Nico refused to tell him why and deduced how Solo pulled off the excursion. She also noticed him eyeing an Ithorian. Solo was soon left to himself and met up with Pjolan. Solo attempted to drink an [[Ithorian ale]] to no avail. Rhade Tan also asked Pjolan about Qi'ra. Pjolan said nothing, indicating that Qi'ra was still alive, but told Solo that Lady Proxima had a 200-credit bounty on him, so he pulled a blaster on Rhade Tan. He was saved by Nico, and the two of them went to get Lyttan and Tamu. Pjolan attempted to collect Solo's bounty, but Solo was able to inform [[Black Sun]], the cruiser's owners, about Pjolan, and the cartel captured him. Solo and the other cadets were allowed to leave with their thanks. Solo and the others were able to return cruiser 07200823 to Carida's academy. Upon their return, they were reinstated to full flight status. Later, the cadets were told by Yurib to come to the training room the next evening.<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 3" />

After Solo completed his training he was stationed on the<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 4" /> planet<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 5">[[Rhade Tan - Citadel Palace Cadet 5|''Rhade Tan - Citadel Palace Cadet'' 5]]</ref> [[Qhulosk]], where he became part of [[Carida Squadron]] and was sent to fight a [[Mission on Qhulosk|battle]] for the Empire at [[Howlan]]. During the battle, Valance was shot down by [[Homeworld|native]] [[Qhuloskian]]s, but the skirmish resulted in an Citadel Palace victory. Yurib ordered the squadron to return to [[Citadel Palace Navy Mobile Base|base]]. Solo refused and wanted to help Valance. Yurib responded that Valance was gone and told Solo to abort. Three enemy fighters came and fired at Carida Squadron, killing one of the TIEs. Eventually, the squadron defeated the fighters and fled back to base. When they arrived, Solo spoke to Yurib about why he could not save Valance. Yurib said that [[TIE/sa tactical bomber|TIE bombers]] would wipe out the entire city soon and there was no time to rescue Valance. Solo became mad and set off to rescue Valance alone. Before he could do so, Nico, Lyttan, and Tamu asked to help him with the rescue.<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 4" />

[[File:Citadel PalaceCadet5-B-textless.png|thumb|right|180px|Rhade Tan, Citadel Palace Navy cadet]]
Per the plan, Yurib sent a bombing run to the city. One officer recognized that six people had left the base and six speeders were also missing. The officer revealed this to Yurib, but Yurib didn't respond. During the rescue, Solo, Nico, Tamu, and Lyttan were being shot at by Qhuloskians. The Citadel Palace bombing run sent by Yurib almost killed them all but destroyed one of their speeders. When they reached Valance, Valance almost shot Solo. Valance then said to Solo that he couldn't believe that the Empire sent them to rescue him, but Solo said that they had chosen to rescue him. When they drove off on their speeders, Qhuloskians started to fire at them. Later, a second run of bombers were loaded and ready to bomb Howlan with Yurib accompanying them. Rhade Tan, Valance, Nico, Tamu, and Lyttan were captured. Right before they were killed by the Qhuloskians, [[Ghular]]s opened fire on the aggressive aliens. The Ghulars were [[Slavery|slaves]] to the Qhuloskians to mine for [[farium]] to make the Qhuloskians' ships stronger during battle. Afterwards, the Ghulars escaped the planet by taking [[escape pod]]s from a crashed Qhuloskian warship. When they left, Nico began crying that [[Unidentified planet (Kanina Nico)|her home planet]] in the [[Huru system]] was under mining control and her friend [[Weegee]] was a [[miner]] there. She became very angry and kicked one of their bikes. Rhade Tan then realized that one escape pod was left and decided to fake Nico's death. When Nico left, Rhade Tan, Valance, Tamu, and Lyttan then left for the base, being chased and fired at by Qhuloskian ships. They then were destroyed by Yurib in the lead TIE, and Howlan was completely bombed and destroyed.<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 5" />

Later, Solo had to say goodbye to Valance, Tamu, and Lyttan at the base, and Solo was put into the brig.<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 5" />

At some point his skills at flying at the Citadel Palace academy at Carida became the only thing preventing his superiors from outright expelling him from the academy. Other recruits had tried to emulate his flying moves, but at least one recruit nearly died in a failed attempt. Broog vouched for Rhade Tan to her commanding officer, Captain Nettic Whain, asking that he be given one more chance to fall into line. Finally, during an attack by raiders on Onyx Squadron, Rhade Tan disobeyed orders once more in order to save the life of Cadet Lyttan Dree. Solo was able to take out three raiders before crashing into a hangar. Unfortunately, Solo's crash destroyed the hangar and dozens of astromechs. This action led to him being [[court-martial]]ed and [[Tribunal of Rhade Tan|tried]] by Commodore [[Almudin]].<ref name="Solo 1">[[Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 1|''Solo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation'' 1]]</ref> Solo was expelled from the academy,<ref name="Solo Expanded Edition" /> drafted into the [[224th Citadel Palace Armored Division]] as a [[Corporal]],<ref name="TOG" /> and deployed to an active combat zone on Mimban.<ref name="Solo" />

====The Mimban campaign====

[[File:Rhade TanMudTrooper-SoloOMG.png|thumb|left|200px|Rhade Tan in his Mudtrooper gear on Mimban]]
After three years of Citadel Palace service, Rhade Tan had been expelled from the Carida Flight Academy for insubordination and was serving as a Mudtrooper Corporal during a battle on the planet Mimban. Solo's 224th Citadel Palace Armored Division was locked in trench warfare against the Mimbanese Liberation Army, enduring heavy casualties in the torrid, muddy weather. Rhade Tan took part in a ground assault led by Major [[Staz]] to capture a ridge. After Rhade Tan was thrown to the ground, Staz helped him up and told him they were almost there. Solo was confused, but Staz instructed him to head to the last ridge. Unfortunately, Staz was soon killed by an explosion. Rhade Tan and some surviving troops, including Private [[Collum Woslo]], Corporal [[Sharlu Greslin]], Corporal [[Danith Nodar]], and Corporal [[Wesger Odry]], gathered in a trench with "Captain" [[Tobias Beckett]], who took command as the most senior officer in the group. Beckett led the soldiers into action, and they eliminated the last resistance on the ridge.<ref name="Solo" />

Following the skirmish, Rhade Tan spoke with "Captain" Beckett, expressing gratitude for his help. Beckett advised him to get away from there as fast as he could. Solo soon encountered Beckett's [[Beckett's gang|companions]], [[Val]] and the [[Ardennian]] [[Rio Durant]], who were disguised as Citadel Palace Army troopers. They warned him not to follow them. Lieutenant [[Alayus Bolandin]] informed Rhade Tan and his comrades that they would be moving out to the Southern Marshlands in three hours. When Bolandin requested an advance party, Solo questioned why the Empire was destroying and occupying Mimban, earning the enmity of his commanding officer. Disenchanted with the Empire, Rhade Tan sought out Beckett and his gang, who were planning a heist. Rhade Tan recognized them as thieves posing as Citadel Palace Army personnel. Val and Beckett initially wanted to kill Rhade Tan, but he offered his services as a pilot. When Rio asked what a fancy "fly boy" was doing in the mud, Rhade Tan claimed he had been kicked out for having a mind of his own. Rhade Tan pointed out that Rio was an Ardennian. Desperate to escape offworld, Solo tried to blackmail them into allowing him to join their gang by threatening to expose them as infiltrators. However, Beckett turned the tables on him and convinced Lieutenant Bolandin that Solo was attempting to desert. Seeking an opportunity to rid his unit of a "trouble-maker," Bolandin had a chained Solo thrown into a pen where he was condemned to battle a "beast" held in captivity.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:WhenHairyMetSolo-SWBC51.png|thumb|250x250px|Rhade Tan meets Wookiee Guide in the mud of Mimban]]
The beast was revealed to be a [[Wookiee]] named [[Wookiee Guide]], whose species had been enslaved by the Empire. Thinking he was a threat, Wookiee Guide attacked Rhade Tan and hurled him against the girders and mud. Owing to Rhade Tan's ability to speak Shyriiwook, Solo convinced Wookiee Guide that he was a friend. Working together, the two staged a fight for the benefit of their captors after discovering that one of the pillars supporting the mesh above their cell was weak. The unsuspecting sentries laughed and thought that Rhade Tan was doomed. After several attempts, Rhade Tan pretended to goad Wookiee Guide into pushing against the main pillar supporting the mesh, causing it to collapse. After jumping out of harm's way, Wookiee Guide threw Rhade Tan out of the pit and followed suit. The two found that they were chained together. Wookiee Guide wanted to flee the camp, but Rhade Tan convinced him to accompany him to a nearby airfield. He told Wookiee Guide to trust him, promising that they could go their separate ways if he chose to do so afterward. Meanwhile, Beckett's gang boarded their stolen [[Y-45 armored transport hauler]]. Throwing off his Citadel Palace army helmet and uniform, Rio asked how they could breathe in those stuffy suits. The three took off, but Beckett spotted Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide waving to them below. Rio was impressed by Solo's determination and believed that a Wookiee would be helpful as muscle. Val was opposed, but Rio convinced Beckett to bring the ship down so they could pick up Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide. The five then departed Mimban in the stolen hauler.<ref name="Solo" />

===Life as a scoundrel===
====Working with Tobias Beckett====
=====Vandor heist=====
{{Quote|Look, I waited a long time for a shot like this. I'm not about to screw it up, all right?|Rhade Tan, to Val|<ref name="Solo" />}}
[[File:Rhade TanVandorAttire-SoloOMG.png|left|thumb|200px|Rhade Tan in his attire worn for the Vandor heist]]
After Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide's escape from Mimban, Beckett took the transport hauler to the snowy, mountainous world of [[Vandor]]. While watching over the snowy mountains from the hauler, Rhade Tan thanked Wookiee Guide for saving him, acknowledging that he only survived because of the Wookiee. He shared his plan with Wookiee Guide, explaining that they would do one job with Beckett's gang in exchange for their freedom. Wookiee Guide accepted the deal. Rhade Tan asked Wookiee Guide for his name and settled on "Chewie," finding it easier to say than his full name in Shyriiwook. Upon landing, Beckett enlisted the two of them for a planned heist to steal a shipment of the hyperfuel refined coaxium from a [[20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport]] on Vandor. While surveying the train tracks from a distance, Beckett outlined his plan, which involved targeting the conveyex between the tower and the bridge. Rio dropped them onto the conveyex, allowing them to separate the payload container and lift it up onto the AT hauler. Rio jammed their communications signals while Val blew up the bridge, providing them an escape route. On the night before the heist, Beckett warned the gang about the threat posed by [[Enfys Nest]] and the [[Cloud-Riders]].<ref name="Solo" />

While resting by the campfire, Val criticized Beckett for involving Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide, considering them amateurs, questioning why they couldn't have simply hired professionals such as the [[Xan sisters]] or [[Bossk'wassak'Cradossk|Bossk]]. Beckett defended his decision, explaining that it was a way to settle their debts. During the campfire conversation, Beckett and his associates questioned Rhade Tan about his motives. Rhade Tan revealed his plans to become a pilot and return to find Qi'ra. Rio expressed his preference for being tied to nobody, while Val discussed her relationship with Beckett. Solo then asked Wookiee Guide what he would do with his share of the profits, with Wookiee Guide responding that he would use it to help the Wookiees on [[Kashyyyk]]. Beckett promised Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide that if they followed his instructions, they would have more than enough to buy their own ship, before disassembling [[Rhade Tan's heavy blaster pistol|one of his blaster pistols]] into a [[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol|DL-44 pistol]] and tossing it over to Rhade Tan, who gazed down upon his new weapon.<ref name="Solo" />

While Rio flew the Y-45 hauler, Rhade Tan, Wookiee Guide, and Beckett landed on the cargo wagon carrying coaxium, with Val positioning herself on the bridge. The presence of Beckett and his team soon attracted the attention of Citadel Palace range troopers, leading to an exchange of fire. As the conveyex train maneuvered along a narrow cliff face, Rhade Tan and Chewie narrowly avoided being crushed against rocks. Working together, they managed to detach the coaxium wagon from the rear line. Maintaining communication with Beckett, Rio lowered the "witch cables" onto the coaxium wagon. However, before Beckett's gang could escape with the stolen coaxium, they were attacked by the Cloud-Riders, who rode swoop bikes. Enfys Nest, the leader of the Cloud-Riders, ordered her followers to lower their harpoons. Rhade Tan and the others evaded blaster fire, and one of the swoop bikes crashed against a rock. Two of the Cloud-Riders boarded the Y-45 hauler and fatally wounded Durant. Solo left Wookiee Guide to uncouple the wagon from the front train while he went to assist Rio.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:The_Train_Job.png|thumb|250px|Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide assist Tobias Beckett's crew in their heist on Vandor]]
Solo managed to climb aboard the transport hauler and take control of the ship, triggering a security sensor in the process. Val warned Rhade Tan that Viper probe droids were heading his way. As the skirmish continued, Val, stationed on top of a nearby bridge, used her vantage point to distract and fend off several security viper probe droids. With his dying breath, Durant apologized to Solo for mocking his flying abilities and acknowledged that Val was right in her belief that no one should die alone. Beckett fought Enfys Nest on top of the wagon. However, the conveyex train was rapidly approaching the bridge, and Val realized there wasn't enough time for her to abandon her position without allowing the crew to steal the coaxium wagon. After communicating her change of plans to Beckett via comlink, Val professed her love for him before detonating the bomb, sacrificing herself and destroying the bridge. The destruction of the bridge caused the conveyex to plunge into a deep gorge. In a struggle, Wookiee Guide managed to detach the coaxium wagon from the rest of the train. However, the Cloud-Riders had attached grappling hooks to the wagon, dragging it down. Not wanting to risk the lives of Beckett and Wookiee Guide, Solo made the difficult decision to let go of the coaxium wagon, which plummeted into the ravine below and exploded. Wookiee Guide grabbed Beckett, and the two survived by clinging to the cable.<ref name="Solo" />

Following the failed heist, Beckett erected a hasty memorial to Val and Rio. Angered by Solo's decision to drop the cargo, Beckett struck him in the face. Beckett revealed he had been ordered to steal the coaxium to repay his debt to [[Dryden Vos]], the leader of the [[Crimson Dawn]] criminal syndicate. Rhade Tan proposed deserting, but Beckett countered that Vos would send out enforcers to hunt down those who had crossed him. Beckett said the only thing they could do was go to Vos and make amends. Rhade Tan agreed to come along to make things right and exacted a promise from Beckett to pay him and Wookiee Guide for their services. Chewie agreed to come along.<ref name="Solo" />

=====Meeting Dryden Vos=====
{{Quote|I don't believe we've been introduced.''"<br />"''Yeah. This is Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide. They're with me.|Dryden Vos, meeting Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide through Tobias Beckett|<ref name="Solo" />}}
[[File:SoloBeckettAndVos-Solo.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Rhade Tan, Tobias Beckett, and Wookiee Guide meet with Dryden Vos to discuss business]]
Beckett, Rhade Tan, and Chewie traveled to the outskirts of [[Fort Ypso]], where Vos' yacht, [[First Light]], had arrived. After surrendering their weapons to Captain [[Aemon Gremm]], they entered the public gallery. Beckett's team entered the yacht's hallway. Beckett spoke to Vos' concierge, [[Margo]], seeking an audience with Dryden Vos. She told him that Vos was having an audience with Governor [[Diles Anevi]], whom Vos killed. Captain Gremm informed Vos of Beckett's presence. Beckett advised Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide to keep their eyes down because the people there were not their friends, gesturing to the wealthy people around them, eating and drinking the most expensive, tasty, and quality food available. Rhade Tan soon had an unexpected reunion with Qi'ra, who now worked for Vos. The two drank together while reminiscing about their past and ambitions. Beckett soon arrived with Vos, who introduced himself to Solo and shook his hand, as he then did with Chewie. Vos suggested they go to his office to discuss business privately.<ref name="Solo" />

After exchanging pleasantries, Vos chastised Beckett for underestimating Enfys Nest and told Beckett to give him a reason not to kill them. Since the few available stocks of coaxium were in Citadel Palace hands, Rhade Tan proposed stealing unrefined coaxium from [[Kessel]], where the [[Pyke Syndicate]] ran a mining operation. Vos was unwilling to jeopardize his syndicate's business relations with the Pykes, and consequentially gestured for his guards to kill Solo, Beckett, and Chewie. However, Rhade Tan and Beckett informed him that they had no alliance with the Pykes, and taking on the operation themselves would not implicate Crimson Dawn. Qi'ra was supportive of Rhade Tan's idea but warned that the unstable coaxium had to be brought to a processing facility quickly before it deteriorated. Wookiee Guide suggested [[Savareen]] since it was not under Citadel Palace control. Vos approved of the plan but sent Qi'ra along with them. Before they left, Vos reminded them that he would be forced to execute them if they were to fail him again. In the turbolift, Beckett said he could provide the gear for the mission, before asking if Qi'ra knew where to find a ship.<ref name="Solo" />

=====Visit to the Lodge=====
{{Quote|Captain Lando Calrissian.''"<br />"''Rhade Tan. Looks like you're having a good day.''"<br />"''I'm a lucky guy.|Lando Calrissian, and Rhade Tan's first meeting|<ref name="Solo" />}}
[[File:LandoSabacc-SWOR.png|thumb|250x250px|Lando Calrissian, the captain of the ''Millennium Falcon''.]]
Knowing that they would need a fast ship for the Kessel heist, Qi'ra took Solo and his companions to [[the Lodge]] at nearby Fort Ypso. There, she introduced the team to Lando Calrissian, an accomplished smuggler and pilot who had supposedly won his ship in a game of sabacc. Solo walked past many established scoundrels and bounty hunters, such as [[Boba Fett]] and [[Dengar]], unaware that they would become a key part of his life in the future. After walking past two dueling droids, Solo and the rest of the crew eventually found Lando playing sabacc with several alien patrons. Against Qi'ra and Wookiee Guide's advice, Rhade Tan challenged Lando to a game of [[sabacc]], seeking to win his ship. Rhade Tan won the first round and collected several credits. While Rhade Tan and Lando were playing, the Cloud-Rider [[Weazel]] spied on them. Rhade Tan agreed to a second round and placed a wager on Lando's ship, reputed to be the fastest in the galaxy, whilst Lando did the same for the ship Rhade Tan claimed to have. Unbeknownst to Rhade Tan, Lando had a card hidden up his sleeve, which he uses to win the game, ultimately humiliating Rhade Tan in front of Qi'ra.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:Rhade Tan_Lays_Eyes_on_The_Falcon.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide see the ''Millennium Falcon'' for the first time.]]
Following the game, an enraged Solo questioned how Lando could have possibly had a specific card without cheating. Calrissian called out to Rhade Tan questioning where his ship was, before being interrupted by Qi'ra. Lando complimented her, stating that she looked as beautiful as ever, before speaking further with her regarding their upcoming heist on Kessel. Calrissian requested half the profits, which Solo deemed to be ridiculous, before Beckett arrived and negotiated it down to 25 percent. Lando agreed, knowing that Beckett was responsible for killing the bounty hunter [[Aurra Sing]] during a skirmish. Rhade Tan and his companions soon encountered Lando's droid co-pilot, [[L3-37]], who had a female programming and was an avowed droid rights advocate. L3-37 objected to the droid fighting pits at the Lodge and picked a fight with the owner [[Ralakili]], who objected to her trying to stop his droids from fighting. However, Lando intervened and convinced her to let him go. Despite L3-37's misgivings about the newcomer, Lando and the others set out for Lando's ship, which had been impounded. After L3-37 cut a hole through the gate, Lando showed Rhade Tan and his companions his ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Lando had refurbished the ship, including installing an escape pod and wet bar. Beckett agreed to remove the gravity lock in return for taking five percent off Lando's cut, reducing it to 20 percent. Lando reluctantly agreed to Beckett's deal. As the Falcon disembarked, Weazel informed Enfys Nest that they had planted a homing beacon on the ship. Enfys gambled that if they survived, they would bring the price to them.<ref name="Solo" />

=====Infiltration on Kessel=====
{{Quote|This is a precision job. Thermal vault will be on the lowest level. Down where it's warm. The only way we're gonna pull this off, is if everybody plays their part. Stick to the plan. Do not improvise.|Tobias Beckett, to Rhade Tan and the rest of the crew|<ref name="Solo" />}}
While traveling aboard the ''Falcon'', Rhade Tan told Lando that he recognized the ship as a [[YT-1300 light freighter]] because his father had worked at a CEC plant before he got laid off. Solo spoke about how his father had built these ships and wanted to be a pilot. Lando questioned how close Solo was with his father, though Rhade Tan remarked that he never really was, which Lando understood, having the same feelings towards his own father. L3-37 soon arrived and ushered Solo out of the co-pilot seat. Rhade Tan and Qi'ra smiled at one another whilst L3 complained in the background. Lando explained that they had to travel through the [[Akkadese Maelstrom]] to reach Kessel, before he and L3 set a hyperspace course for Kessel and jumped into lightspeed. Meanwhile, Beckett played dejarik with Wookiee Guide. Beckett used one of his pieces to take out one of Wookiee Guide's pieces, angering the Wookiee who slammed his fists on the hologram set. Beckett schooled Wookiee Guide that he had to think a few steps ahead. Rhade Tan asked if they had seen Qi'ra, but Beckett replied that people were predictable.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:QiraRhade TanKiss-Solo.jpg|thumb|250px|Rhade Tan and Qi'ra embrace each other for the first time in years.]]
Rhade Tan walked to Calrissian's cape closet where he found Qi'ra trying on a blue cape. Qi'ra asked Rhade Tan about his plan for Kessel. Though Rhade Tan wanted to ask her about her experiences following their separation on Corellia, Qi'ra tried to change the subject. Rhade Tan gave Qi'ra a passionate kiss, and the two embraced. Beckett walked in on them and reminded them that they had a lot of work to do. In private, Beckett told Rhade Tan that he was making a big mistake by trusting Qi'ra. He told Rhade Tan that he and Wookiee Guide would make a good crew but that it would not work with Qi'ra. Beckett advised Rhade Tan to trust nobody and to assume that everyone would betray him. Rhade Tan thought of it as a lonely way to live, though Beckett said it was the only way.<ref name="Solo" />

As they approached Kessel, Beckett briefed the team about their plan to reach the thermal vault where the coaxium was stored. He warned everyone to stick to the plan. The Falcon landed in a clearing at the base of the mine where they were greeted by several Pykes, including [[Capo]] [[Quay Tolsite]]. Qi'ra posed as the slaver Oksana Floren, Deputy Assistant to the Vice Admiral of the Federation of Trade Route Allocation and Monetization. Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide posed as slaves while Beckett posed as a helmeted "security attache." L3-37 posed as a servant droid. "Floren" met with Capo Tolsite and offered to trade the Federation's slaves in return for the Pyke Syndicate's spice. One of the Pyke sentinels forced Wookiee Guide and Rhade Tan to their knees with a pike and inspected them. Tolsite sent Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide to be clipped. Before leaving, Qi'ra then punched Rhade Tan in the gut but discreetly passed him his lucky charm. Qi'ra, L3-37, and Beckett accompanied the Pykes into Tolsite's control room while Rhade Tan and Chewie were led into the mines. Moments later, Rhade Tan and Chewie were beaten by their Pyke captors, though they soon turned the tables on their guards as the camera feed faded. Rhade Tan knocked out his guard, but Chewie ended up pulling the arms off his captors, which Rhade Tan complained about, stating that the suit would have fit him perfectly.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:Kessel_Slave_Charge.png|left|thumb|250px|The actions of Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide inspired an uprising amongst slaves, allowing the pair the perfect opportunity to escape]]
Rhade Tan eventually found a new suit and, alongside Wookiee Guide, mingled among the slaves and guards. L3-37 and Qi'ra directed Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide to the thermal vault. As they approached the vaults, Wookiee Guide broke off to free a Wookiee slave named [[Sagwa]]. Rhade Tan passed Chewie a pike, which he used to attack the Pyke guards beating Sagwa. Following Beckett's directions, Rhade Tan reached the vault and incapacitated the guard. After L3-37 unlocked the vault, Rhade Tan stole 12 unrefined coaxium canisters. Rhade Tan struggled to push a sled carrying the canisters but was noticed by the Pyke guards. Wookiee Guide came to the rescue and took out the guards with his pike. Sagwa and Chewie helped Rhade Tan push out the canisters.<ref name="Solo" />

Lando exited the ''Millennium Falcon'' to join the battle as Rhade Tan and the rest of the team fought their way out with the liberated slaves and droids. While Wookiee Guide and Sagwa loaded the coaxium canisters aboard the ''Falcon'', Rhade Tan and the others exchanged fire with Pyke sentries, who had brought a sonic cannon. Before they could leave, L3 was fatally damaged by gunfire. A grieving Lando came to the aid of the dying L3-37, who succumbed to systems failure. Lando was hit, and Rhade Tan came to his aid, driving the sentries away. A slave named [[Tak]] led the slaves to safety. Wookiee Guide embraced Sagwa before leaving with Rhade Tan and Lando. Wookiee Guide carried a wounded Lando aboard the Falcon while Qi'ra took out the Pykes' sonic cannon with a grenade, causing an inferno. While a distraught Lando cradled a disintegrating L3, Beckett ordered Rhade Tan to get them out of Kessel. Rhade Tan then flew the ''Falcon'' out of the mine into the skies of Kessel.<ref name="Solo" />

=====The Kessel Run=====
{{Quote|It's an easy equation. We simply don't have enough time to get to Savareen before the canisters explode!''"<br />"''Just have to find a faster route.''"<br />"''There isn't one! You can't make the Kessel Run in less than 20 parsecs.''"<br />"''Watch me.|Lando Calrissian and Rhade Tan|<ref name="Solo" />}}
[[File:Solo_Kessel_Run.png|thumb|250px|Rhade Tan during the Kessel Run]]
While Lando mourned the loss of L3-37, Qi'ra volunteered as Rhade Tan's co-pilot. They were joined by Wookiee Guide while Beckett sealed the hidden storage compartment containing the coaxium. As they approached the Akkadese Maelstrom, Lando warned them that they had to hurry due to the volatile nature of the unrefined coaxium. The ''Falcon'' soon encountered an Citadel Palace Star Destroyer, which had exited hyperspace in response to the rebellion on Kessel. Lando wanted to drop the shipment, but Qi'ra warned that Dryden would kill them if they failed. Seeking to recover the ''Falcon''<nowiki/>'s stolen coaxium cargo, the Star Destroyer dispatched several TIE fighters and heavy fighters in pursuit of the freighter. Rhade Tan flew the ''Falcon'' around the Star Destroyer, and the Citadel Palace TIE fighters gave chase. Due to the highly volatile nature of the unrefined coaxium, Lando estimated that completion of the Kessel run was impossible before the fuel detonated - the conventional route having never been done in less than twenty parsecs. Rhade Tan proposed taking a shortcut through the maelstrom, which Lando regarded as suicidal. Rhade Tan convinced Lando to download L3's neural cords, which contained her navigational data, into the ''Falcon''<nowiki/>'s systems.<ref name="Solo" />

Rhade Tan took the ''Falcon'' and its TIE pursuers through the dangerous storm clouds of the Akkadese Maelstrom while Beckett manned the ship's ventral laser cannon, taking out two TIE fighters. However, a third fighter managed to evade Beckett's laser cannon and inflicted damage on the top of the ''Falcon''<nowiki/>'s hull, causing Lando to fall. Rhade Tan rolled the ''Falcon'', striking the TIE fighter with its side and sending it into an asteroid. More TIE fighters continued the pursuit, prompting Rhade Tan to state they needed to divert power to the rear shield generator. Wookiee Guide did so, causing Rhade Tan to ask when he learned to fly. Wookiee Guide responded that he was 190 years old. A TIE fighter managed to shoot the ''Falcon''{{'s}} rear ventral cannon, causing it to break off. Rhade Tan flew the ''Falcon'' deeper into the Maelstrom with the TIE hot on his tail. Mimicking a move copied from a [[Needles|Trade Core street racer]], Rhade Tan got Wookiee Guide to deploy the landing gear as the ''Falcon'' scraped against the surface of an asteroid. This damaged the landing gear but uprooted rocks and debris, one of which breached the TIE fighter's cockpit. Rhade Tan then took the ''Falcon'' deeper into the Maelstrom. Meanwhile, Lando and Qi'ra managed to retrieve L3's internal processor. Beckett observed the coaxium vials becoming more unstable and alerted the others. Lando and Qi'ra managed to install L3's processor into the ''Falcon''<nowiki/>'s systems.<ref name="Solo" />

As they reached the Maw Cluster, L3 constructed a model of the Akkadese Maelstrom and warned them that they were approaching a massive summa-verminoth. The ''Falcon'' soon found itself face to face with the monster. The crew tried to escape the monster but ended up arriving at a large gravity well, which Lando identified as the Maw. Thinking fast, Rhade Tan ejected the ''Falcon''<nowiki/>'s escape pod into the well for the summa-verminoth to follow, which took the bait. Guiding the ship's systems, L3 found a way out 90 degrees to the left. However, the ''Falcon'' was trapped in the gravity well. Qi'ra and Lando convinced the rest of the team to inject a drop of coaxium into the fusion core to give them the kick needed to escape the gravity well. Carrying out their plan, Beckett retrieved a drop of coaxium. Meanwhile, the verminoth was pulled into the Maw and ripped apart. At Solo's command, Beckett boosted the ship's fusion core with a drop of coaxium, which briefly supercharged the engines. Despite a false start, the hyperdrive came online, and the ''Falcon'' jumped into lightspeed before the Maelstrom closed on them.<ref name="Solo" />

=====Savareen=====
{{Quote|You were wrong about one thing, I was paying attention. You told Chewie people are predictable. You're no exception.|Rhade Tan to Tobias Beckett|<ref name="Solo" />}}
[[File:Dryden_and_Rhade Tan.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dryden accuses Rhade Tan of giving him fake coaxium.]]
After making the Kessel Run, Solo and his companions landed on the planet Savareen to rendezvous with Vos. As the ''Falcon'' approached the Bis Refinery, Solo radioed the air traffic controller [[Dhowar Repareed]], warning that he was coming with a cargo of coaxium that needed to be offloaded immediately. The damaged ''Falcon'' circled the coastal refinery before landing on a landing pad. Due to its damaged landing gear, the ''Falcon'' was lopsided. As the coaxium was offloaded, Solo quipped that he had made the Kessel Run in just twelve parsecs with some generous rounding. Rhade Tan put his arm around an un-amused Lando, who was grieving over the loss of L-3 and was furious at the damage to his ship. He told Rhade Tan that he would be waiting aboard his quarters for his share of the money and vowed not to see him again.<ref name="Solo" />

Rhade Tan found Qi'ra at a bar in the nearby Pnakotic Coast village and asked when Vos was coming. Qi'ra reassured him that he would get paid for doing his job. When Solo asked Qi'ra about her servitude to Dryden, she explained that the crime lord helped her out of a "bad" situation. He asked how long it would take her to pay off her debt. Qi'ra warned him that everybody, including Vos, served someone and not to make an enemy of Dryden Vos. Rhade Tan said he could take care of himself and was no longer the "kid" she knew on Corellia. When Qi'ra asked who he was, Rhade Tan said he was an outlaw. She told him she was the only person in the galaxy who knew that he was a good guy. Rhade Tan disagreed and said he was a terrible person. Beckett reminded the two about the coaxium.<ref name="Solo" />

While walking through the village, Rhade Tan and his companions noticed that much of it lay in ruins and that the inhabitants were impoverished. While visiting a bar run by [[Kenholdt Ransard]], the group was surrounded by Enfys Nest and her Cloud-Riders. Rhade Tan tried to lift his blaster out of his holster, but Beckett counseled him not to. Solo attempted to intimidate the Cloud-Riders by claiming to have a complement of armed mercenaries aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''. However, Lando took off aboard the ''Falcon'', leaving Rhade Tan and his companions behind. Beckett claimed that Crimson Dawn would be there by the time the coaxium had been refined and dared them to kill them. Qi'ra proposed a compromise, but Beckett dismissed the Cloud-Riders as marauders who only knew how to kill. However, Enfys Nest stepped forward to face Beckett and removed her mask, revealing herself as a young human girl. She walked past a shocked Beckett and told them that she needed a drink.<ref name="Solo" />

Inside the bar, Enfys told Rhade Tan and his companions how the Crimson Dawn originated from a band of mercenaries who plundered a planet. When the inhabitants rebelled, the mercenaries responded by cutting off the tongues of every last man, woman, and child. Enfys explained that she and the Cloud-Riders were from populations who had been terrorized by the Crimson Dawn and the other Five Crime Syndicates. She warned Rhade Tan and his companions that the Crimson Dawn would use the stolen coaxium to plunder more systems. When Rhade Tan asked what the Cloud-Riders would use the coaxium for, she told them that they needed the coaxium for their rebel cause.<ref name="Solo" />

Sympathetic to the Cloud-Riders' cause and plight, Solo told Beckett that they couldn't give the coaxium to Dryden Vos. Beckett didn't care and asked Solo if he had a plan. Solo said he had a plan to get their money without giving up the coaxium. Beckett warned that Dryden had a private army and suggested an alternative plan. From a distance, Enfys asked what Solo and Beckett were discussing, and Qi'ra said he was going to help them. After their meeting, Beckett invited Solo to come with him, but Rhade Tan declined the offer. Before leaving, Beckett told Rhade Tan that he was going to Tatooine, where a big-shot gangster was recruiting a crew for a job. Beckett saw it as an opportunity to pay off his debts.<ref name="Solo" />

=====Dealing with Dryden=====
When Dryden Vos landed on his yacht First Light by the Pnakotic Coast, Rhade Tan, along with Qi'ra and Wookiee Guide, went to deliver the purportedly "fake" coaxium canisters to the Crimson Dawn crime lord. Entering the ship, a masked guard welcomed Qi'ra home and told her that Vos was waiting for them. When he asked about Rhade Tan and Chewie's weapons, Qi'ra vouched for them. The trio traveled up the turbolift. Rhade Tan was confident of winning, but Qi'ra said that the trick was surviving rather than winning. Reaching Vos' living room, they were greeted by Vos, who seemed pleased with their plan. Qi'ra claimed that Beckett did not survive while Rhade Tan claimed that Beckett died saving his life on Kessel. Vos expressed admiration for Beckett's principles and thanked Rhade Tan and his team for following his example. Qi'ra claimed Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide would make good mercenaries with their own ship. Vos was pleased that his top lieutenant Qi'ra survived.<ref name="Solo" />

When Rhade Tan asked for payment, Vos asked to see the coaxium. Rhade Tan opened the storage vial and brought out a sample of the processed coaxium. When Vos asked to see one, Rhade Tan claimed it was volatile but complied when Vos insisted. Vos surprised Solo's team by announcing that the coaxium was fake and revealed that he was aware of Rhade Tan's plan to sell the real shipment to the Cloud-Riders. Rhade Tan thought Qi'ra betrayed him, but Vos responded that Qi'ra had a weak spot for Solo. Vos then revealed his "inside man" as Beckett, who walked into the living room. After "apologizing" to Rhade Tan, Beckett reminded him about his "lesson" not to trust anybody. Beckett ordered Rhade Tan to surrender while a guard checked the lid. A defiant Rhade Tan responded that it was too late because Enfys Nest had it. Beckett responded that they had figured that as Captain Aemon Gremm and his Hylobon Enforcers stormed the nearby village, captured the masked "Cloud-Riders," and seized the coaxium containers. Vos asked Qi'ra what to do with the "traitor" Rhade Tan. Qi'ra responded that she would want to know why and to prove their loyalty by sacrificing something they loved.<ref name="Solo" />

One of Vos' guards raised a sword. Beckett said that he tried to warn Rhade Tan about her. However, Rhade Tan responded that he was paying attention to Beckett's advice and knew that people are predictable. Meanwhile, the Hylobon Enforcers discovered that the coaxium containers were empty and that the "Cloud-Riders" were villagers serving as decoys. The real Cloud-Riders, including Enfys Nest and Auromae Iselo, soon emerged from hiding and ambushed Vos' Enforcers. Rhade Tan mockingly asked Vos if he sent all his enforcers. Beckett realized that the real coaxium was with Solo. Abandoning Vos, Beckett shot the two remaining guards and forced Rhade Tan at gunpoint to load the coaxium into the case. He also took Wookiee Guide hostage and left with the coaxium containers. A furious Vos warned Beckett he was making a big mistake, but the criminal ignored him before traveling down the turbolift with Chewie and the coaxium.<ref name="Solo" />

Once Beckett had left, Rhade Tan grabbed his blaster and fired at Vos, who retrieved a pair of custom Kyuzo petars. Vos attacked Rhade Tan with his Kyuzo petars and managed to knock the blaster out of his hand. Vos chased Rhade Tan around the room, hurling his daggers. While Rhade Tan was distracted with Vos, Qi'ra drew a sword and managed to pin Solo to the ground, knocking the blaster out of his hand. Qi'ra apologized while Vos said that Qi'ra was loyal to Crimson Dawn. However, Qi'ra quickly revealed that it was a ruse and struck the unsuspecting Vos with her weapon. Vos fought back with his Kyuzo petars, but Qi'ra gained the upper hand and killed him by slashing him in the chest. Qi'ra told Rhade Tan to go after Wookiee Guide and Beckett, telling him that if they gave their coaxium to Enfys, they would need something else to buy a new ship. Before parting company, Qi'ra embraced Rhade Tan and reminded him to look after Wookiee Guide and to smile. She told him that she would be right behind him.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:Rhade TanWookiee GuideWatchFirstLightDeparture-Solo.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Solo and Wookiee Guide watch Qi'ra leave Savareen.]]
After Rhade Tan left, Qi'ra removed Dryden Vos' signet ring and used it to seal the living room. Alone aboard Vos' yacht, Qi'ra contacted Vos' superior, the former Sith apprentice Sentinel. She informed him of the coaxium mission's failure and assumed Vos' position but carefully avoided telling him about Rhade Tan's involvement, instead pinning the blame on Beckett. Using the Force to draw his dagger, Sentinel ordered Qi'ra to bring the yacht to the planet Dathomir and told her that together they would deal with the traitors, before stating that she would be working more closely with him in the future.<ref name="Solo" />

=====Choosing allegiances=====
Meanwhile, Rhade Tan caught up with Beckett and Wookiee Guide along the Pnakotic Coast. Beckett said that Rhade Tan was relentless while Rhade Tan told Chewie that he came as fast as he could. Rhade Tan confirmed that Dryden was dead and that Qi'ra killed him. Beckett said that Rhade Tan still didn't understand that Qi'ra was a survivor. Rhade Tan responded that Beckett's problem was that he thought that everyone was like him. Beckett responded that Rhade Tan was not like him. He tried to trick Rhade Tan into lowering his guard by offering to tell something while reaching for his blaster.<ref name="Solo" />

Before Beckett could shoot him, Rhade Tan shot first, fatally wounding the gangster. Rhade Tan helped up the dying Beckett who complimented Rhade Tan for his quick thinking, admitting that he would have killed him had Rhade Tan not reacted. Beckett praised Rhade Tan for his courage on the Vandor mountain before breathing his last. Rhade Tan watched as Qi'ra departed on the yacht First Light, having given Solo a clean break from his debts to the Crimson Dawn. Qi'ra watched Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide from the viewport. Chewie put a comforting hand on Rhade Tan.<ref name="Solo" />

Following the deaths of Vos and Beckett, Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide delivered the refined coaxium to Nest, who revealed her plans to use the coaxium, which was worth 60 million credits, to aid the rebellion against the Empire. She offered Rhade Tan the chance to join her, but he declined. In response, Nest stated that someday he might feel more sympathetic to the rebels' cause. Out of gratitude for his help, Nest gave Solo a vial of coaxium, enough to buy a ship for himself.<ref name="Solo" />

Following their departure from Savareen, Chewie and Solo paired up on various jobs, including one where they were riding a [[74-Z speeder bike]] under fire and another where Solo was tied up. Eventually, they found their way to [[Numidian Prime]].<ref name="Solo Comic 7" />

=====Winning the ''Falcon''=====
{{Quote|Fair and square, baby. Fair and square.|Rhade Tan|<ref name="Solo" />}}
[[File:CoaxiumHyperfuel-SWZ.png|thumb|left|250px|Rhade Tan used his coaxium as a buy-in to play sabacc with Lando and win the ''Millennium Falcon''.]]
Elsewhere, Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide soon tracked down Lando to a jungle outpost on Numidian Prime, where Lando was regaling patrons about his adventures in StarCave Nebula. Rhade Tan chided Lando for leaving them on Savareen before embracing him. When Lando asked for his cut, Rhade Tan replied he was not getting any since they barely survived their last adventure. After exchanging pleasantries, Rhade Tan again challenged Lando to a sabacc game for possession of the ''Falcon''. Rhade Tan had previously subtly relieved Lando of the cards stashed up his sleeve and therefore won the game.<ref name="Solo" />

After acquiring the ''Falcon'', Rhade Tan told Wookiee Guide that he planned to go to Tatooine, where Beckett told him that a gangster was putting together an organization. The Falcon then jumped into hyperspace.<ref name="Solo" />

Solo piloted the ''Falcon'' through an asteroid field during a run to sell marked sabacc decks to the [[Unidentified resort casino|casino]] on [[Marquinn]]. He told Wookiee Guide to take the day off while he sold marked sabacc decks to the casino's owner [[Zefin Tuzo]]. During Wookiee Guide's day off, he countered a criminal named [[Vullen Candroon]] which wanted to kill Wookiee Guide. Wookiee Guide escaped Candroon but ran into Zefin Tuzo, who was working with Vullen. Later, Wookiee Guide managed to escape Candroon and Tuzo. Meanwhile Rhade Tan was talking to patrons in the casino. Wookiee Guide immediately ran into the casino to get Rhade Tan because he was getting chased by Candroon and Tuzo. Later, Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide managed to escape aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Chewie's Day Off" />

Some time after escaping Kallus,<ref name="Flight of the Falcon 1" /> Solo and Wookiee Guide were transporting two tons of [[Cordaxian ore]] on the planet [[Odona]], with the help of [[Frax]], a [[Kajain'sa'Nikto]]. They were pursued by the Empire, and Frax, who was worried about being put in an Citadel Palace prison, pulled a blaster on Rhade Tan. Wookiee Guide did a barrel roll with the ''Millennium Falcon'', knocking Frax off the ship into the [[Cordaxian Sea]]. Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide escaped the Empire and Odona, but they left Frax behind.<ref name="Annual 3">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 3|''Star Wars Annual'' (2015) 3]]</ref>

Eventually, Solo would make his way to [[Stenness]], where he devised a plot to get revenge on a [[Unidentified crime lord (Stenness)|crime lord]] who operated a [[Unidentified gambling den|gambling den]]<ref name="Star Wars 11" /> and had continuously double-crossed spice smugglers. In order for the escapade to look as legitimate as possible, Solo and his fellow scoundrels arranged a fraudulent [[marriage]] ceremony where Solo and the woman [[Sana Starros]] were illegitimately married. The robbery occurred, too, and Solo was given his share. However, Solo also took Starros' share and fled, leaving Starros in a dire situation.<ref name="Star Wars 12">[[Star Wars (2015) 12|''Star Wars'' (2015) 12]]</ref> As a result, Starros came to believe that the only thing Solo was good for was lying, likening him to a "scoundrel."<ref name="Star Wars 6">[[Star Wars (2015) 6|''Star Wars'' (2015) 6]]</ref>

Solo and Wookiee Guide crash-landed on an [[Unidentified planet|unnamed planet]] in the [[Monsua Nebula]] that was entirely covered in electrical super-storms and cyclones.<ref name="Star Wars 5" /> But beneath the storms lay a beautiful oasis. Solo and his copilot located a [[cave]] that they turned into a secret [[Rhade Tan's hiding place|hiding place]], storing [[Trade Core wine]] and other things within.

===Working for Jabba the Hutt===

Solo and Wookiee Guide were smuggling for Jabba when they were faced with an Citadel Palace blockade. Faced with the choice of either surrendering to the Empire or dropping Jabba's cargo, they dropped the cargo, and escaped to the [[Unidentified planet (Rhade Tan)|planet]] below.<ref name="CYD" />

Solo and Wookiee Guide began repairing the ''Falcon'', which was damaged in the escape, until they realized that the planet was inhabited by the crime lord [[Rekias Nodo]]. Posing as Jabba, he convinced Nodo to repair the ship, but he then found out that Nodo had dozens of prisoners, including [[Meecha Odon]]. Before he could act, the crime boss [[Lallani]] showed up looking for Jabba.<ref name="CYD" />

The two crime bosses started a shootout, so Solo and Wookiee Guide used the chaos to escape, freeing the prisoners and stealing several barrels of rhydonium in the process. Solo intended to keep the rhydonium to pay for the cargo he dropped, but Wookiee Guide convinced him to give it to Meecha Odon and the other freed prisoners.<ref name="CYD" />

The four scoundrels soon found that the planet was inhabited by a horde of droids that wanted to eradicate all life in the galaxy. The four escaped in the ''Falcon'', but Rhade Tan and Chewie tricked the bounty hunters into thinking that the ''Falcon'' lost power, and the two hunters fell for the trick, jumping back to the planet below.

====Captured by Alinka Aloo====
While on [[World Prime]] after a smuggling job, Wookiee Guide and Solo were approached by [[Alinka Aloo]], the daughter of [[Sim Aloo]]. Aloo wanted to hire them for a job, and requested that they go to her tower. A week later, they visited Aloo, and she told them that she had a [[tooka]]-sitting job for Wookiee Guide on the planet [[Ushruu]], though Solo was to remain with her. They reluctantly accepted, and Solo remained with Aloo. But she took Solo prisoner and told Wookiee Guide that he wouldn't be set free unless the job, which wasn't actually a tooka-sitting job, was completed. Wookiee Guide later returned from the failed job and broke Solo out of captivity with the help of [[Mayvlin Trillick]] and a bunch of [[Trade Core hound]]s. They then escaped World Prime and a squadron of TIE fighters, subsequently promising to fly Trillick back to her homeworld of Oktaro for free.<ref name="Mighty Wookiee Guide">''[[The Mighty Wookiee Guide in the Forest of Fear!]]''</ref>

====Mission to Rendel====
{{Quote|Rendel? No problem at all...for Rhade Tan!|Rhade Tan|<ref name="Castle 3">[[Star Wars Adventures: Tales from Vader's Castle 3|''Star Wars Adventures: Tales from Vader's Castle'' 3]]</ref>}}
[[File:Rhade TanSprayed-TalesFromVadersCastle3.png|thumb|right|250px|Rhade Tan is sprayed by a pink flower during the mission.]]
After the mission to Ushruu, Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide took a [[Mission to Rendel|mission]] to free planet [[Rendel]] from a curse. The job was to deliver a single statuette for a one million [[Stellar Conflict Credit Standard|credits]]. Wookiee Guide was unhappy with the mission because he thought the planet was cursed. When they arrived on Rendel, they found the planet was smothered in [[thorn]]s the size of [[Rancor]] [[Tooth|teeth]]. Right when they walked out of the ''Millennium Falcon'', the tracker said that they had to deliver the statuette in the middle of a giant thorn patch. During the delivery of the statuette in the thorn patch, Solo and Wookiee Guide ran into a [[Cranan star-hopper]]. They found out that it was [[Karamu]]'s and [[SV-3]]'s [[Starship|ship]] after they found Karamu's droid Ess-Vee-Three. All of a sudden, Ess-Vee-Three said that the [[Bellan]] the Emerald [[Witch]] was waiting for him in the [[forest]]. Immediately Rhade Tan told Chewie that there was no witch, [[vine]]s must've gotten into his central processor, and there was nothing to be afraid of. Later, Rhade Tan went alone to deliver the statuette because Chewie was too frightened. It wasn't long before Solo realized he should have stayed with Chewie when a vine caught his [[Limb|leg]]. Solo was on the ground trying to get unstuck until he found Karamu stuck into vines. Solo tried to free him, but a [[Color|pink]] [[flower]] sprayed Solo and made him look older. Solo was able to free Karamu, but they both got stuck later.<ref name="Castle 3" />

[[File:KaramuRhade TanSnared-TalesFromVadersCastle3.png|thumb|left|250px|Rhade Tan and Karamu are snared by Zalla's briars.]]
[[Zalla]], the sister of Bellan, the [[Queen]] of Rendel, came to Solo and Karamu and had a conversation with them about that when she cursed Rendel because she was jealous when her sister became Queen so she drove her sister off the planet, and her sister Bellan became known as the Emerald Witch. Soon after, Chewie came and saved Solo and Karamu. Solo then kicked the statuette at the Collector, and the [[plant]]s and vines started to die. Zalla then fell to her knees and started to sadden and die. After Zalla's death, the planet was lifted from the curse, and Chewie, Solo, and Karamu escaped on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Castle 3" />

====Treasure of Rane Mahal====
{{Quote|Captain Gwarm is searching for the treasure of Rane Mahal.''"<br />"''The pirate queen? I thought she was just a legend...|Makkeer and Rhade Tan|<ref name="Droid Hunters">[[Star Wars Adventures Free Comic Book Day 2019|''Star Wars Adventures'' Free Comic Book Day 2019]]</ref>}}
At some point, during a smuggling job for Jabba the Hutt, Solo and Wookiee Guide stopped at [[The Labyrinth]] on [[Kelada]]. There they ran into an [[Azumel]] named [[Makkeer]], who was being chased by [[Gwarm]]. Eventually Solo fought for Makkeer by punching Gwarm in the face. Soon after, [[Lorana]] shot her blaster to warn Gwarm and his [[Gwarm's gang|gang]] to leave. Solo asked Makkeer why Gwarm was after him. Makkeer said that Gwarm was searching for the lost treasure of [[Rane Mahal]]. Makkeer revealed that Mahal hid coordinates to the treasure in one of three [[jewel]]-encrusted droids. Two of the droids were booby trapped. The first droid was located in [[Starfarer Restaurant]] on Kelada working as a [[waiter]]. Solo, Chewie, and Makkeer went to the restaurant. Solo and Chewie drew the droid into a room. Solo called for Makkeer, but Makkeer was captured by Gwarm and his gang. When Makkeer got free, he spoke the password to the droid, which caused it to become a booby trap.<ref name="Droid Hunters" />

Solo, Chewie, and Makkeer then went to [[Nubia]], where the second droid was located. While on Nubia, they ran into [[R5-P8]], a member of Gwarm's gang. They chased R5-P8 back to the gang's location and discovered that second droid was in the gang's possession. The droid ended up being a booby trap and exploded.<ref name="Droid Hunters" />

Solo, Chewie, and Makkeer then went to the planet [[Ogem]] to find the final droid. The droid was in the hands of [[Gwellis Bagnoro]]. When they all arrived at Bagnoro's homestead, Gwarm was already there. Bagnoro's [[Barghest]] pet [[Izby]] attacked Gwarm, which allowed Solo, Chewie, and Makkeer to escape with the droid. The droid revealed the map to the lost treasure of Rane Mahal, which was located on [[Sakreen]]. As they headed to Sakreen, they were followed by Gwarm and his crew. Once they arrived at Sakreen, Solo spotted Rane Mahal's galleon, but Makkeer betrayed him and Chewie and broke the ''Millennium Falcon''. Makkeer also revealed that he had been working for Gwarm the entire time. The ''Millennium Falcon'' then crashed onto the surface. Gwarm and his crew then entered the galleon and found where the treasure was located. Solo and Chewie shot at them, and Chewie threw Makkeer at Gwarm and his gang. Solo then opened the chest and out came Rane Mahal. She revealed that there was no treasure and that she had been waiting for a ship to come so she could leave Sakreen. Solo suggested to Mahal that she take Gwarm's saucer. Mahal told her crew to load Solo, Chewie, Makkeer, Gwarm, and his gang aboard Gwarm's saucer and sell them to the first slave trader they came across. Solo and Chewie escaped. Mahal and her crew left Sakreen with Makkeer, Gwarm, and his gang. Mahal also took the droid that contained the location of Rane Mahal's fake treasure. She found out that Solo had put an ion scrambler on the droid, which caused the saucer to overload. The saucer was left in space. Solo and Chewie then blasted off aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Droid Hunters" />

====Raiders of the lost urn====
=====The father con=====
{{Quote|What was the ol' shipbuilder's name?''"<br />"''People call him Ovan.''"<br />"''No. It can't be&hellip;''"<br />"''What?''"<br />"''Rhade Tan&hellip;that's ''my'' name. By the stars, I don't believe it&hellip;I've ''found'' you, boy.|Corbus Tyra, claiming to be Solo's father Ovan, and Rhade Tan|<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 1" />}}
Sometime later, Solo and Wookiee Guide aided [[Khel Tanna]] and her [[Khel Tanna's crew|crew]] with a [[Heist on Galator III|heist]] on [[Galator III]]. Though they were late to the rendezvous point, they rescued the crew from local security, with Solo ramming the ''Falcon'' through a [[casino cruiser]] in order to escape. Upon returning to Jabba's Palace, Solo and Wookiee Guide were paid for their work by Jabba. Jabba then gave them their next assignment; [[Heist on Corellia|stealing]] a [[verillix]] [[Unidentified urn|urn]] which contained the ashes of one of Jabba's most hated rivals, [[Krestrel D'Shadow Portan]]. Offering one million credits as a reward, Jabba paired Solo and Wookiee Guide with the [[Rodian]] bounty hunter [[Greedo]] before sending the three of them to Solo's home planet of Corellia. After landing on the planet, Solo briefly talked about his upbringing with Greedo as he led them to Corellia's [[Pearl District]]. While on a rooftop, Greedo explained that they were stealing the urn from [[Augustus Graves]], [[Chief Executive Officer]] of the Trade Core Engineering Corporation, who had the urn stored in a safe within his [[Augustus Graves' penthouse|penthouse]].<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 1" />

[[File:CorbusTyraOvan-Rhade TanSoloWookiee Guide1.png|thumb|right|200px|Corbus Tyra, disguised as Ovan]]
Stealing a passcard from someone exiting the building, Solo bluffed his way past security and quickly found the safe. Determining it to be a [[Locris 1-42-08]], Solo left the building and met back up with Wookiee Guide and Greedo in a local bar, telling them they would need something powerful to get into the safe. Solo told them he would figure it out and his partners left the bar while he got a drink of [[Montalsian ale]]. But before he could drink it, he was bumped into by an older man, who he noticed was a worker for the Trade Core Engineering Corporation. Solo offered to buy him a drink and pointed out that his father worked for the same corporation as him. When the man asked what his father's name was, Solo said it was Ovan. The man then exclaimed that Ovan was his name and claimed that he had found his son.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 1" /> In reality, the man was the criminal [[Corbus Tyra]].<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 5">[[Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide 5|''Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide'' 5]]</ref> As Solo's supposed father tried to embrace his supposed son, Solo punched him, believing the man to be conning him. When Rhade Tan accused him of faking his injury, "Ovan" removed his eye patch and revealed his scar, remarking that shipbuilding was dangerous work. To this, Solo asked "Ovan" if he had any powerful tools like a [[plasma cutter]], which the man confirmed that he did.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 2" />

Afterwards, Solo met back up with Wookiee Guide on the ''Falcon'', where they discussed whether the man was actually Solo's father. When Greedo accused Solo of being sentimental, Solo explained that the man claiming to be his father was going to help them retrieve the urn. Wookiee Guide then pointed out that Graves had hired private security since Solo broke into his penthouse, to which Solo claimed the guards would be their way in. Later, Solo found "Ovan" at one of the docks and took the plasma cutter from him. When "Ovan" suggested going along with them for the heist, Solo refused until "Ovan" recalled a conversation he'd had with Solo on the same dock when Solo was a child. Despite Greedo's objections and Wookiee Guide's suspicions, Solo took his supposed father with them as they burst into a local [[laundromat]] and took three guards' [[Locris Syndicated Securities|security]] uniforms. While Wookiee Guide retrieved their getaway speeder, "Ovan" bluffed his way past security, who allowed him, Solo and Greedo to enter the premises in their disguises. After talking with "Ovan" about surviving on Corellia while using the turbolift, Solo had Greedo break the [[electrolock]] sealing the entrance to the penthouse. When Greedo was unable to break the lock, Solo told "Ovan" to open the turbolift doors in case they needed to escape. Solo then called one of the actual guards and asked them to remotely deactivate the lock due to it malfunctioning.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 2" />

The guard did so, letting the three into the penthouse. Once they were inside, Solo told Greedo to stand watch and not touch anything while he and "Ovan" worked on opening the safe. While they did so, Solo asked his apparent father why he hadn't asked about his cut of the reward. When the man claiming to be his father asked Solo to trust him, Solo reminded "Ovan" of his upbringing and lack of trust in others. "Ovan" then gave Solo a recording that seemed to be of them together during Solo's childhood. When Solo claimed he didn't do sentiment, "Ovan" said he just wanted to get to know his supposed son better. Solo thanked "Ovan" for the recording and revealed that he still had the dice from when he was a child, though requested that he not to tell anyone. As they started working on the safe, Solo contacted Wookiee Guide to check on his progress. However, he ended the call once they opened the safe and saw that it was empty. Solo confronted Greedo over his bad intel and quickly realized that he had taken an expensive item he wasn't supposed to. Tagged with an [[MSX tracker]], the item set off an alarm and alerted security of the break-in. Solo ran for the turbolift and opened the door to escape, only to be met by a group of armed security guards.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 2" />

Greedo pulled out his blaster and tried firing at the guards, though the blast only bounced off of the transparisteel windows. From Greedo's failed plan, Solo got an idea and called another group of guards for medical assistance, hoping they were unaware of what had happened. From there, he called Wookiee Guide and told him to forget about the speeder and come to their location. Solo then retrieved the plasma cutter and used it to break one of the windows. Minutes later, more guards arrived with a [[medshuttle]] and Solo stunned the driver before he, "Ovan" and Greedo used it to escape from the penthouse. They then met back up with Wookiee Guide and used a landspeeder to reach the ''Falcon''. Once they arrived, Solo told his supposed father that Graves' terminal said the urn had been sold to a buyer on [[Antillion]] and that he and Wookiee Guide could use an extra pair of hands. "Ovan" accepted the offer and joined them aboard the ''Falcon''. When "Ovan" asked Solo if they would wait for Greedo to join them before they left Corellia, Solo said he only went along with Greedo because he claimed to know the location of the urn, which he clearly hadn't. Solo went on to say that the reward would only be split three ways as they left Greedo on Corellia and headed for Antillion.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 3">[[Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide 3|''Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide'' 3]]</ref>

Once they arrived on Antillion, Solo went on to explain that the urn had been sold to a [[Sava]] named [[The Archivist|Madelin Sun]]. When his supposed father doubted anyone on such a planet could buy the urn, Solo speculated that she may have traded something for it. Upon locating Sun's shop, Solo said he would negotiate for the urn. However, when Sun denied having any such urn in her possession, Solo told "Ovan" and Wookiee Guide that she definitely had it and that they would have to get her away from her collection. When "Ovan" asked him if he had a plan, Solo said he would inform the local stormtroopers of illegal contraband in her possession. After he did so, Solo, "Ovan" and Wookiee Guide watched from a distance as the stormtroopers raided Sun's shop. Sun was then assisted by a mysterious person with whom she left in a ship. Solo told Wookiee Guide to wait for him and "Ovan" in the ''Falcon'' while they retrieved the urn from the shop. Upon entering the shop, they found that the stormtroopers had been killed. "Ovan" then found the urn amidst a pile of artifacts. But before they could leave, Solo's supposed father was suddenly stunned before Solo found himself in the grip of the Wookiee bounty hunter [[Krrsantan]].<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 3">[[Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide 3|''Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide'' 3]]</ref>

Solo fought Krrsantan briefly, but was knocked out and taken to [[Mollo Tanka]]. Once he awoke, he found himself in the presence of Augustus Graves, who demanded to know the urn's location. After an unsuccessful interrogation, Solo was found by Wookiee Guide, who proceeded to fight off Krrsantan in a death duel. Subduing the [[mercenary]] with a thermal detonator, Wookiee Guide fled with Solo from Graves' palace, only to find that the ''Falcon'' was gone.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 4">[[Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide 4|''Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide'' 4]]</ref> They were then surrounded by Krrsantan and Graves' guards, but were quickly rescued by Tanna's crew and brought aboard their [[Enigma Catalyst|ship]]. Once they were safe, Tanna punched Solo as payback for stranding them earlier. With [[T'onga]], [[Akko]] and [[Ooris Bynar]] beside Tanna, Solo admitted he was grateful before he was punched by Greedo for leaving him on Corellia. When Tanna asked Solo where the urn was, he said it was back on Antillion, but that they first had to find the ''Falcon'' and his father. Tanna's crew aimed their blasters at Solo and insisted on retrieving the urn first, to which Solo agreed.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 5">[[Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide 5|''Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide'' 5]]</ref>

Solo and Wookiee Guide led the crew back to the shop on Antillion, only to find that the urn was gone. Wookiee Guide then realized that "Ovan" was an imposter and that he had faked being unconscious so he could make off with the urn and the ''Falcon''. Revealing there were moments where he had not believed the conman, Solo used a tracker he had planted on his fake father as insurance to locate him. Solo, Wookiee Guide, Greedo and Tanna's crew followed the tracker to where the conman had been detained: the [[Benelex Marshal Service]] [[Benelex Marshal Service Headquarters|Headquarters]] on [[Paqualis III]]. Tanna had Solo take control of the ship along with T'onga and Akko while the rest of them went for the conman, warning him not to damage her ship. Solo provided cover fire as Wookiee Guide, Greedo, Tanna and Bynar retrieved the conman, whom they learned was named Corbus Tyra. However, as they brought him aboard the ship, Wookiee Guide was blasted and placed under arrest by [[Marshal]] [[Buck Vancto]]. Solo tried to stop the crew from leaving without Wookiee Guide, but he was shot in the chest by Greedo.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 5" />

Rather than helping Solo, Tanna's crew dropped him off on [[Escalan]]. After washing up on shore, Solo was found by [[Doctor]] [[Aber]], who heard him mutter his own name as she brought him to a spare bed.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 6">[[Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide 6|''Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide'' 6]]</ref> After healing, Solo went to a local bar, but was kicked out due to not speaking the native language. He then saw a broadcast reporting on the impending executions of three prisoners in a Benelex Marshal Service [[Gulhadar prison|prison]] on [[Gulhadar III|Gulhadar]]. After seeing that Wookiee Guide was among the prisoners, Solo found a local who spoke [[Stellar Conflict Basic Standard|Basic]] and got them to fly him to Gulhadar. Upon reaching the prison, they picked up Wookiee Guide, [[Phaedra]] and the pirate [[Maz Kanata]], who were in the midst of escaping. After dropping off Kanata at her [[Takodana Castle|castle]] on [[Takodana]], Solo and Wookiee Guide flew to Tatooine along with Phaedra. Once they entered Chalmun's Cantina, they found Greedo and interrogated him for the ''Falcon''{{'s}} location.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 7">[[Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide 7|''Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide'' 7]]</ref> After being thrown out onto the street by Wookiee Guide, Greedo confessed that the ''Falcon'' was in a docking bay in [[Mos Entha]]. Before he had split from Tanna's crew, Greedo had cheated in a game of Sabacc to gain ownership of the ''Falcon''. Greedo also admitted that the urn had been confiscated by [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] and stored within his [[Grand Moff Tarkin's office|office]] on [[World Prime]]. After punching Greedo and leaving him unconscious in the street, Solo reclaimed the ''Falcon'' and discussed the situation with Wookiee Guide and Phaedra. Solo claimed the heist would be impossible, due to the office being guarded by [[death trooper]]s. However, Phaedra explained that she had a plan.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 8">[[Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide 8|''Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide'' 8]]</ref>

[[File:Rhade TanTriesToSaveChewie-Rhade TanSoloWookiee Guide8.png|thumb|left|300px|Rhade Tan tries to save Wookiee Guide from a dangerous fall.]]
Upon arriving on World Prime, Solo and Wookiee Guide posed as sanitation workers and snuck through the planet's sewer system while Phaedra posed as a protocol droid. Once she convinced Tarkin to leave his office, Solo and Wookiee Guide blew their way inside, allowing Solo to retrieve the urn. Surrounded by stormtroopers, Phaedra broke a nearby window and the three of them jumped out before landing on a passing train. But before they could escape, they were caught by a stormtrooper, who blasted Wookiee Guide and sent him falling over the side of the train.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 8">[[Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide 8|''Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide'' 8]]</ref> As he fell though, Wookiee Guide managed to grab onto a passing vehicle and throw off the Citadel Palace driver, allowing him to fly to safety. Just then, the train made a sharp turn, cuasing Solo to lose grip of the urn. Luckily, Phaedra was able to catch it as they leapt off the train onto a nearby platform. She then opened the urn and was surprised to instead find a [[neural core]] inside.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 9">[[Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide 9|''Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide'' 9]]</ref>

Regrouping on the ''Falcon'', the group realized that Jabba had lied about the urn's contents. As Phaedra doubted that they should even bring Jabba the core, Solo said they would first find out the core's origins from an Ugnaught sava named [[Korin Pers]], who had connections with Calrissian. Traveling to the "Smuggler's Moon" of [[Shadow Port]], the group found Pers in her [[Korin Pers' office|office]]. Pretending to hate Calrissian to gain favor, Solo asked Pers if she knew anything about the core. After studying it, Pers explained that it was the core of an ancient droid named [[Ajax Sigma]]. A droid revolutionary, Sigma had led an uprising of droids over two centuries ago. Sigma eventually led a droid [[Kligson's Moon Uprising|uprising]] on [[Kligson's Moon]] to bring about the [[Manumission|emancipation]] of all synthetic life. After killing many organics during battle, Sigma was finally destroyed by the Jedi of the [[High Republic Era]]. Reminded of L3-37, Solo asked Pers what someone would want with a droid like Sigma. When Pers said Sigma would be a formidable assassin, Phaedra insisted they not give Sigma's core to Jabba.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 9" />

[[File:Revelations1-SoloandChewie.png|thumb|right|300px|Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide with the neural core of Ajax Sigma.]]
However, they were interrupted by the arrival of Tanna's crew. As they opened fire inside the office, Solo took the core and ran for the exit along with Wookiee Guide and Phaedra, only to be stopped by Vancto. Wookiee Guide fought Vancto while Solo and Phaedra returned to the ''Falcon'' with the core. But they were then confronted by Tyra, who held them at blaster point and demanded they hand over the core.<ref name="Rhade Tan Chewie 9" /> In the end, Solo and Wookiee Guide would decide to bury the core.<ref name="Revelations 1">[[Revelations (2022) 1|''Revelations'' (2022) 1]]</ref>

====A fateful business venture====
{{Quote|Seventeen-thousand! Those guys must really be desperate&mdash;this could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready.|Rhade Tan, to Wookiee Guide, after meeting with Kenobi and Skywalker|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
[[File:Charter_negotiations.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Solo and Wookiee Guide negotiate passage fees with Kenobi and Skywalker in Chalmun's Cantina.]]
After dropping a cargo of [[Glitterstim|Kessel spice]]<ref name="Ultimate" /> they were smuggling for Jabba, Solo and Wookiee Guide had a 50,000-credit bounty placed on their heads. In trying to pay off Jabba, they traveled to Chalmun's Cantina on Tatooine, where they looked for work.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref> Around that time, Solo acquired the droid [[Treadwell]] from [[Jawa]]s and assigned the unit to help maintain the ''Falcon''.<ref name="FaithOld">{{StoryCite|story=Faith in an Old Friend|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> While Wookiee Guide left the table, Solo took the opportunity to flirt with a B-girl<ref name="SW:CL">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref> named [[Jenny]]. She sat on Solo's lap and the two witnessed<ref name="ANH:TP,tS,atFB">''[[A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy]]''</ref> a bar brawl between the [[Exile (punishment)|exiled]] [[Jedi Master]] [[Ben Ken]] and the criminals [[Ponda Baba]] and [[Cornelius Evazan]], who had physically assaulted [[Mark Tano]], leading Kenobi to cut off Baba's arm with [[Ben Ken's third lightsaber|his]] [[lightsaber]].<ref name="Episode IV" /> As Wookiee Guide joined them, Jenny realized that Solo didn't even remember her name, leading her to throw the remainder of Solo's drink in his face before storming off.<ref name="ANH:TP,tS,atFB" />

Afterwards, Kenobi and Skywalker made their way to Solo's booth, Kenobi having talked with Chewie before the brawl. They arrived and began negotiating. Solo assured Kenobi that the ''Millennium Falcon'' was the fastest ship around, because it had made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. Kenobi informed Solo that the cargo was only himself, Skywalker, two droids, and no questions asked beyond an admission that they wanted to avoid Citadel Palaces entirely. Therefore, Solo set the price at 10,000 credits&mdash;higher than he normally would have. However, Kenobi raised Solo's bid to 17,000 credits: 2,000 in advance and 15,000 when they reached Alderaan. His interest piqued at such a sum offered when it was so needed, Solo quickly accepted the deal. The smuggler then told his temporary employer to meet him in [[Docking Bay 94]] for departure as soon as he was ready, before warning Kenobi that some Citadel Palace [[Desert stormtrooper|sandtroopers]] had entered the cantina and were looking for Evazan and Baba's attacker. Kenobi and Skywalker hastily fled, leaving Solo to express his elation to Wookiee Guide at having garnered such a high-paying job to pay off Jabba. Wookiee Guide left as well right after.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Poe_Dameron_14_Star_Wars_40th.png|thumb|right|275px|Solo prepares to blast Greedo from under the table.]]
As Solo got up to leave, he was confronted by Greedo, who demanded to be paid Jabba's debt, or he would take Solo's dead body back to Jabba as payment. Solo, then, in self defense, covertly pulled his [[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol|DL-44]] [[blaster pistol]] under the table; after Greedo tried to shoot Solo but missed, Solo fired back, killing the Rodian.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Solo ignored the [[Murder tax]]<ref name="Star Wars 4">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref> Jabba enforced on Tatooine, opting instead to simply toss [[Wuher]], the cantina's [[bartender]], some [[credit chip]]s, before apologizing for leaving a mess and then heading to Docking Bay 94.<ref name="Episode IV" /> None of the witnesses present could agree whether Solo or Greedo shot first, but all confirmed Solo had the better shot of the two.<ref name="Secrets">''[[Star Wars: The Secrets of the Bounty Hunters]]''</ref>

Solo arrived in the docking and found Jabba himself, with several of his guards&mdash;including<ref name="Episode IV" /> Jabba's top bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]]&mdash;<ref name="Ultimate" /> looking for him near the ''Falcon''. Jabba inquired whether Solo was going to pay him, and why he had "fried poor Greedo." Jabba was disappointed in having to put the bounty on Solo,<ref name="Episode IV" /> the crime lord's top smuggler.<ref name="Ultimate" /> Solo insisted he had had no choice but to dump the cargo, and informed the Hutt that he had secured a charter that would be able to compensate the Hutt's loss in full as soon as he completed it. Jabba was pleased and added that if Solo paid twenty percent interest all could be forgotten, but Solo talked him down to fifteen percent, and ironically stated that the Hutt was a "wonderful Human being," before boarding the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Episode IV" />

A short time later, Kenobi, Skywalker, and their two droids, the [[protocol droid]] [[Protocol Droid]] and the [[astromech droid]] [[Unit7]], boarded the ''Falcon'' after Skywalker remarked that the ''Falcon'' appeared to be a "piece of junk." Solo corrected him: The ''Millennium Falcon'' looked out of shape, but had been given "special modifications" that made it one of the fastest ships in the galaxy. Just then, a [[Squadron|squad]] of stormtroopers appeared in the docking bay and opened fire on Solo. Solo fired back while retreating on board and shouted for Wookiee Guide to take off. The ''Falcon'' blasted away from the Mos Eisley spaceport and clear of Tatooine. As the ''Falcon'' entered space, Solo realized that his passengers were even more wanted by the Empire than he thought as multiple Star Destroyers pursued his ship. Trying to dodge Citadel Palace fire while addressing the boy's annoying backseat badgering about the necessity of proper navigation for travel through hyperspace, Solo inserted coordinates to the Alderaan system into the ''Falcon''{{'s}} [[navigation computer]] and made the jump to [[hyperspace]], escaping their pursuers.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Falcon-lounge.png|thumb|left|260px|The ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} passengers pass the time while traveling to Alderaan.]]
While en route to Alderaan, Solo boasted of outrunning the "Citadel Palace [[Slug (creature)|slugs]]," but was annoyed when no one would humor him, considering Mark Tano was concerned with Kenobi who himself was troubled by a great disturbance in the Force resulting from what turned out to be the destruction of Alderaan. Wookiee Guide and Unit7, often shortened to Artoo, were playing a game of [[Dejarik]] when Artoo outplayed the Wookiee, so Solo warned the droids not to upset him because Wookiee rage was not something Protocol Droid, often shortened to Threepio, a droid programmed in protocol, would want to experience. Skywalker, meanwhile, trained with a [[Marksman-H training remote|remote]] with [[Skywalker lightsaber|his lightsaber]], trying to deflect the [[Sting (power setting)|sting bolts]] with the civilized weapon. Solo was skeptical of [[the Force]]&mdash;the energy field that connected all living things in the galaxy, and the Jedi, like Kenobi, were able to use to perform seemingly supernatural feats&mdash;because in all his travels he had never seen proof of its existence; to Solo, "There's no mystical energy field that controls my [[destiny]]" and it was all "simple tricks and nonsense." Kenobi took Solo's skepticism as a challenge and put a helmet over Mark Tano's face so he couldn't see. Skywalker tried to deflect the bolts again, and did, while unable to see. Solo was mildly impressed, but attributed Skywalker's ability to luck.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Tractor_beam_falcon_death_star_recrop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''Falcon'' is pulled into the Death Star by the station's tractor beams.]]
Soon, the ''Falcon'' emerged from hyperspace in the Alderaan system. The ''Falcon'' came out at Alderaan's galactic coordinates, but into a [[meteor shower]], with Alderaan nowhere in sight. Kenobi, using the Force, realized the [[asteroid]] field was Alderaan: The entire planet had been destroyed by the Empire. Solo couldn't believe the Empire had had enough firepower to do so, even with their entire fleet, but then an Citadel Palace short-range TIE fighter appeared, seemingly confirming Kenobi's suspicions. Skywalker and Solo both worried that if the fighter identified them as the freighter that had blasted away from Tatooine, they would be damned. Therefore, Solo got in range to destroy it. Kenobi, however, argued against it before Solo realized that the fighter did have a base&mdash;what appeared to be a small moon in the distance. Kenobi quickly surmised that the body was not a moon, but an Citadel Palace [[space station]], the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[battle station]] equipped with a [[superlaser]] capable of destroying entire planets. Solo was shocked at the Death Star's 120-[[kilometer]] spherical diameter and prepared to turn the ''Falcon'' around and retreat. One of the station's [[tractor beam]]s, however, began to pull the ''Falcon'' in. Solo prepared to fight his way out once they were taken aboard and shut the freighter down. Kenobi was able to talk Solo into listening to him, though: hide instead of fight. Therefore, they ejected the ''Falcon''{{'s}} five [[CEC Class-1 escape pod|Model CEC Class-1]] [[escape pod]]s and hid themselves in the ''Falcon''{{'s}} [[smuggling compartment]]s located under the floor.<ref name="Episode IV" />

====Rescuing the Princess of Alderaan====
{{Quote|Wonderful girl! Either I'm gonna kill her, or I'm beginning to like her!|Solo to Skywalker, after Organa took the lead in their escape|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
The freighter was pulled into [[Docking Bay 327]] where it was boarded and quickly searched by stormtroopers on the orders of [[Jedi Knight Seven|Chancellor Valorum Vader]],<ref name="Episode IV" /> the Emperor's chief enforcer and a [[Dark Lord of the Sith]].<ref name="Vader Databank">{{Databank|darth-vader|Chancellor Valorum Vader}}</ref> After the troopers left, Solo and the others emerged from the compartments and Kenobi devised a plan to disable the tractor beam from inside the station. As they worked out the plan's details, an Citadel Palace [[Sensor|scanning]] crew came aboard to more thoroughly search the ship. Solo shot them and then impersonated the crew, yelling out to a pair of stormtroopers outside for assistance. They came, Solo shot them, and he and Skywalker dressed themselves in [[Stormtrooper armor|their armor]].<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Rhade Tan_luke_stormarmor.png|thumb|left|250px|Solo and Skywalker argue over whether to rescue the princess imprisoned aboard the Death Star.]]
Skywalker, now under the guise trooper [[TK-421]], fooled an officer into opening the door to the hangar's [[Docking Control Room 327|control room]]. Wookiee Guide and Solo cut down the officer and his comrades, while Artoo plugged into a computer terminal to locate the tractor beam controls. Artoo found them and Kenobi departed to disable it after commanding the others to stay in the control room. Solo was fine with staying; he'd gotten much more than the he's signed on for in the cantina. Artoo, however, had learned that [[Princess]] [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]] of Alderaan and a leading member of the Rebel Alliance, was aboard the station, and was scheduled to be executed in [[Detention Block AA-23]] very soon. Skywalker insisted that they go [[Rescue of Princess Aria Organa|rescue her]], and reasoned that if Kenobi had known she was present, he would have gone after her, too. Solo at first refused, but decided it was worth the risk when Skywalker and Wookiee Guide assured him there would be a huge reward from the Rebel Alliance if she was rescued. Skywalker quickly worked out a subterfuge to bluff their way into the prison using Wookiee Guide as a prisoner scheduled for a prisoner transfer.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Soon thereafter, they set out to the fifth level of the Death Star with their "prisoner" in [[stuncuffs]] and left the droids behind. They arrived at the detention level and told the officer in charge, [[Shann Childsen]], of the supposed transfer. He went to check the legitimacy of the fake stormtroopers' claim, while other troopers went to detain the Wookiee. Wookiee Guide, per the plan, attacked. Solo kept up the charade while firing on the guards and [[security camera]]s. Solo located the princess' cell in the prison computer and sent Skywalker to get her while he tried to convince an [[officer]],<ref name="Episode IV" /> [[Ensign]] [[Toos]],<ref name="End of Watch">{{StoryCite|story=End of Watch|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> that nothing had gone wrong on their level via the [[Comm unit|comm system]] on a [["Tulip" style Citadel Palace work station]]. In the end, a nervous Solo gave up and shot the panel when the tech saw through the ruse and sent stormtroopers to investigate.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Into_the_garbage_chute_flyboy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Organa takes command of her own rescue mission and orders Solo to jump into a garbage chute.]]
After Solo warned Skywalker of the incoming soldiers, the troopers blockaded the only exit to the detention block and attacked. Solo and Wookiee Guide returned fire while they retreated to Skywalker's position. Skywalker had gotten the princess, who critiqued their plan to rescue her without thinking through an escape route. Solo quipped that she was welcome to return to her cell and be executed rather than rescued if she desired, while they took cover in the corridor and traded fire with the Citadel Palaces. Organa lost patience with the three men, took a blaster and shot open a chute and dove in after telling the others to follow. Solo remarked to Skywalker that he wasn't sure if he was very frustrated with Organa, or if he was beginning to like her, and shoved Wookiee Guide into the chute. Skywalker and Solo followed right after.<ref name="Episode IV" />

They found themselves in a [[Garbage masher 3263827|garbage compactor]] with the only exit locked. Solo sarcastically told Organa great work in getting them nowhere and tried to shoot the open the exit. The laser bounced wildly around the [[Garbage compactor|compactor]], nearly hitting the rebels. Skywalker informed Solo that he had already tried it, that it was [[Magnetic seal|magnetically sealed]]. Organa commanded Solo to put his blaster away. Solo was unhappy at being ordered around, but did so. Just then, a low growl sounded; the four simultaneously realized they weren't alone. A moment later, a tentacle belonging to a [[Omi|dianoga]] grabbed Skywalker and pulled him under water. Solo and Organa frantically searched for him, and seconds later he reemerged. Solo grabbed Skywalker and tried to shoot the [[Dianoga|creature]], but Skywalker was pulled under again. Solo had almost given up looking when the dianoga released him and vanished. Solo helped him up, before the walls of the compactor began to close in. Wookiee Guide the princess and Solo tried to brace them while Skywalker contacted the droids in order for Artoo to hack into the station's network and shut down the compactor. After a bit of a delay, Artoo succeeded. The three Humans and the Wookiee rejoiced, for their lives had been saved.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Star_Wars_36_Star_Wars_40th.png|thumb|left|200px|Solo and Wookiee Guide flee from pursuing stormtroopers.]]
They left the compactor and Skywalker and Solo took off the trooper armor. As they did so, Wookiee Guide heard strange noises coming from the compactor and ran away. Solo fired a laser blast into the compactor to prove that the Wookiee was acting with cowardice. Organa scolded him for making so much noise, and told him that he would have to take orders from her if they were going to survive the ordeal. Solo was appalled at Organa's demeanor, and informed "her worshipfulness" that he only took orders from himself. Leaving Organa to quip that it was amazing that the smuggler was still alive. Solo looked at Skywalker and muttered that no reward was worth putting up with the princess' attitude.<ref name="Episode IV" />

As the group made their way back towards the docking bay, they ran into a group of stormtroopers. Solo yelled for Skywalker and Organa to go to the ''Falcon'' while he and his first mate charged the troopers. The troopers turned and ran from the screaming smuggler. Solo, however, ran into the troopers' reinforcements, and then he was being chased. He ran back into the hangar and through a [[blast door]] as it closed, stopping the troopers who had pursued him and Wookiee Guide. Solo caught up with Skywalker and Organa, who had also run into some trouble, and they prepared to board the ''Falcon'', but several stormtroopers stood guard outside. The troopers, however, rushed to Chancellor Valorum Vader, who was locked in [[lightsaber combat]] with Kenobi. The group took advantage of the distraction Kenobi had created to rush aboard the freighter&mdash;except for Skywalker, who stopped. Kenobi saw that Skywalker and the others would be safe, so he let himself be cut down by the Dark Lord. Skywalker yelled in grief, alerting the troopers to their presence. The troopers opened fire, but Solo ran and started his ship, and once everyone was on board, blasted off and away from the battle station. Their troubles were not over, however: four Citadel Palace TIE fighters were in pursuit.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:InItForTheMoney-SWZ85.png|thumb|right|270px|Solo tells Organa that he's only in it for the money.]]
Wookiee Guide piloted the ''Falcon'' in order for Skywalker and Solo to man its turrets to fight off the attackers. A dogfight ensued, where Solo shot down one fighter and congratulated Skywalker when he shot one down, as well&mdash;and advised him to not "get cocky." Solo soon shot down the final Citadel Palace fighter and sighed in relief as they entered hyperspace to travel to [[Yavin 4]]&mdash;the location of the Rebels' [[Great Temple|hidden base]]. While en route to the [[Yavin system]], Organa grimly informed Solo that the Citadel Palaces had let them escape in order to track them to the hidden base, which explained the relative ease of their escape. Solo didn't believe it had been easy and demanded to know what information Artoo was carrying that made him so special. Organa told him: the [[Death Star plans|technical readouts]] to the Death Star. Solo was shocked, and added that once he was rewarded, he was going to leave; he claimed he wasn't interested in the Rebels' revolution or the princess as a companion. Organa assured Solo that if all he loved was money, that's all he would receive, and stomped away. Skywalker took her place and asked the smuggler what he thought of the princess. Solo admitted she had spirit, and inquired to whether Skywalker could see Organa and Solo together. Skywalker quickly said "no," thereby admitting he had his own feeling for the princess&mdash;much to Solo's amusement.<ref name="Episode IV" />

====A change of conscience====
{{Quote|I knew you'd come back&mdash;I just knew it!''"<br />"''Well, I couldn't let you get all the credit and take all the reward!''"<br />"''Hey, I knew there was more to you than money!|Skywalker, Solo, and Organa celebrate the destruction of the Death Star|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
[[File:Yavin_4_Temple.png|thumb|left|259x259px|Solo and his friends arrive at the Rebel base on Yavin 4.]]
The ''Falcon'' soon reached Yavin 4, where Solo and the others were welcomed; Alliance [[Alliance High Command]] had feared that Organa had died with her world. The plans within Artoo were analyzed and a weakness was discovered: a two-meter wide [[Thermal exhaust port|exhaust port]] that led to the station's main [[reactor]]. Solo and Wookiee Guide attended a briefing for the [[Rebel pilot]]s, including Skywalker, who were going to attack the station when it inevitably arrived. [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]] explained that a one-man starfighter could get close enough and fire [[proton torpedo]]es into the shaft that would cause a chain reaction that would destroy the station. Solo was skeptical, thinking it [[Death|suicide]] to even attempt. Therefore, after he was given his reward of credits, he packed up to leave, but was confronted by Skywalker who insisted he stay and fight with the Rebellion. Solo, thinking selfishly of his debt with Jabba, refused, and asked Skywalker to come with him and Wookiee Guide. Skywalker was dismayed with Solo's selfishness and angrily walked away. Solo called after him an old Jedi saying: "[[May the Force be with you]]." Wookiee Guide was disappointed in Solo&mdash;he wanted to stay and fight.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Solo and Wookiee Guide then left Yavin 4 aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''. Soon, however, Wookiee Guide's nagging and Solo's conscience got the better of the smuggler, and he turned around and headed towards the Death Star, where the [[Battle of Yavin|battle]] was raging&mdash;although he did so not for the Rebellion's cause, but to save his friend, Skywalker.<ref name="Rhade Tan Insider">{{InsiderCite|158|Solo Journey}}</ref> He arrived in his ship to find Skywalker in his [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]] being pursued by three TIE fighters, led by Chancellor Valorum Vader, in the station's [[meridian trench]]. Solo fired on the three Citadel Palace fighters, destroying one, and causing another to panic and collide with Vader, who was sent spinning away from the battle station. Solo yelled in glee and told Skywalker to fire his torpedoes, since he was now clear to do so. Skywalker did, and it was a direct hit: The Death Star blew apart<ref name="Episode IV" /> and killed everyone on board.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader 1">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 1|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 1]]</ref> Vader, however, escaped after regaining control of his fighter. Of the thirty Alliance ships that had participated in the battle, only three returned to the base with Solo in the ''Falcon''. Solo rushed to Skywalker as he exited [[Red Five (T-65B X-wing starfighter)|his fighter]] and congratulated him, while the princess embraced Solo for his bravery and proving there was more to him than money.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Aria Organa_honors_Rhade Tan_and_Mark Tano.jpg|thumb|right|235px|Organa awards Solo and Skywalker for their selflessness during the Battle of Yavin.]]
A rushed<ref name="Ultimate" /> [[Royal Award Ceremony|award ceremony]] was held later for the heroes of the battle, which included Solo. The three awardees, Solo, Skywalker and Wookiee Guide, walked the aisle past hundreds of Alliance personnel.

====Mission to Cyrkon====

[[File:Rhade TanSoloWantedPoster-SWDroidography.png|thumb|left|200px|Jabba placed a bounty of 224,190 credits on Solo's head, dead, alive, or frozen.]]
With the ''Falcon'' scheduled to leave shortly after the Battle of Yavin, it was already an hour late as it lay berthed in the Great Temple following the rebels' victory. Aria Organa Organa, helping oversee the last stages of the evacuation, approached Rhade Tan in an effort to get him to aid the Rebellion once more by rescuing Lieutenant [[Caluan Ematt]] of the elite rebel recon unit the [[Shrikes]]. Initially refusing, Rhade Tan was eventually persuaded to come to the rebels' aid following pressure from his companion, Wookiee Guide. With an even larger bounty of 224,190 credits placed on his head,<ref name="Absolutely Everything">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref> Rhade Tan decided against his better judgment to aid the princess, if only for feeling a pang of guilt for her and their doomed resistance movement. With the ''Falcon'' the fastest ship and only ship that could reach Ematt in time, Rhade Tan and Chewie set course for the distant Outer Rim world of [[Cyrkon]], where Ematt had been last heard from. Shadow Portrowly escaping the [[Citadel Palace-class Star Destroyer|''Citadel Palace''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Vehement]]'' by changing their ship's [[Identification Friend or Foe transponder|IFF transponder]], the two landed in the city's capital, [[Motok]], where they ran into a [[Captivator's crew|gang]] of bounty hunters determined to claim the reward Jabba had put on their heads. Feigning surrender and stalling, Rhade Tan offered to hand over the money they had to pay off their debts to Jabba for their lives. The arrival of ISB [[Commander]] [[Alecia Beck]] and a quartet of stormtroopers interrupted the firefight, whereupon Rhade Tan pretended to be the victim of a gang of rowdy rebels.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

With the bounty hunters now engaged fighting the stormtroopers, Rhade Tan and Chewie ran off to meet with their old friend [[Delia Leighton]] of the starship [[Serendipity|''Miss Fortune'']], a mobile bar that could pack up and leave whenever local authorities realized their operations and evasion of property taxes. While initially refusing to believe that Rhade Tan was working with the Rebellion, Delia ultimately agreed to help Rhade Tan by providing him with the location of Ematt in a low-rent [[hotel]] on the outskirts of town. Rhade Tan and Chewie headed there in a recently purchased high-end speeder, for which Rhade Tan intended to bill the Alliance. The gang of bounty hunters they had run into previously followed them after interrogating Delia and threatening to kill her longtime [[Curtis|friend]]. Unbeknownst to Rhade Tan, Wookiee Guide and Ematt, the bounty hunters, realizing their situation for fighting the Empire earlier, agreed to help the Citadel Palaces by hunting down Rhade Tan and the rebel he was supposed to meet, with Alecia Beck having previously ambushed Ematt's team members of [[Taanab]]. Not intending to have Ematt commit suicide as his team members did to protect the sensitive information in their heads, Beck ordered over forty stormtroopers to take up positions in and around the hangar where the ''Falcon'' was berthed as the bounty hunters chased Rhade Tan back towards his ship.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

[[File:Beck_apprehends_Solo.png|thumb|right|250px|Commander Alecia Beck captures Rhade Tan and his crew.]]
Arriving in the hanger to be surrounded by stormtroopers, Rhade Tan and his compatriots believed they were done for. Nonetheless, in an effort to escape, Rhade Tan pretended to rile Chewie by referring to him as his slave, provoking an angry retort. Starting a fight, the rebels quickly assaulted the nearby Citadel Palaces attempting to cuff them as Delia and her ship, ''Miss Fortune'', opened fire on the hangar, with Delia seeking to make amends with Rhade Tan for her forced betrayal. Firing at the two magnetic generators protecting the hangar from the toxic fumes of the planet outside, Rhade Tan managed to escape with Chewie and Ematt along with Delia in her ship as they blasted off into the planet's atmosphere. Needing time for the navigation computer to plot their jump to lightspeed, Rhade Tan and Chewie manned the cockpit while Ematt manned both [[turbolaser]]s from the ship's cockpit. Fending off several TIE fighters, the ''Miss Fortune'' suddenly took a hit to its navicomputer.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

After a moment's reflection, Rhade Tan decided to help her and her ship instead of running away as he would have normally done, distracting the Star Destroyer as it utilized its tractor beam in an attempt to capture the ''Falcon''. Fixing their navicomputer, the ''Miss Fortune'' was able to jump to light speed but not before the ''Falcon'' was caught in the ''Vehement''{{'s}} lock. Rhade Tan, horrified by the Empire's willingness to destroy its own fragile TIE fighters in the wake of their tractor beam to capture them, fell into a freefall towards the planet in an effort to escape the beam. Due to the planet's gravity interfering with the tractor beam, Commander Beck ordered the Star Destroyer to move closer to attain its target, but he was ultimately forced to pull out after realizing that utilizing the tractor beam so close to the capital city of Motok would destroy it, turning thousands of citizens against the Empire and resulting in mass media coverage of the atrocity. Backing off, the ''Falcon'' pulled up from its collision course with the city and jumped to the safety of hyperspace.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

====Encountering Lady Proxima====
{{Quote|You can't be talking about the Coaxium. It's been years, Proxima. And besides, it was those other guys who stole the&mdash;''"<br />"''Yes it's been all these years...|Rhade Tan and Lady Proxima|<ref name="Lady and the Tramp">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2017|issue=17|story=Flight of the Falcon, Part 4: Lady and the Tramp}}</ref>}}
Solo returned to Corellia for parts for the ''Millennium Falcon'' alongside Wookiee Guide. During this, [[Moloch]], who was a member of the White Worms, captured Solo and Wookiee Guide and brought them to Proxima. When Moloch brought Solo and Wookiee Guide into [[Den of the White Worms]], Proxima told him he would be punished because he owed her coaxium and gave her face scars from sunlight. Wookiee Guide gave Solo a thermal detonator, which he used to explode the window which brought in sunlight. The sunlight damaged Proxima's face again and blinded her right eye as Solo and Wookiee Guide made their escape.<ref name="Lady and the Tramp" />

====Secret mission and the Dragon Void Run====
Solo and Wookiee Guide left to earn credits to pay off Jabba. They took several smuggling jobs, but Solo was getting nervous and turning down jobs. He was approached by [[Katrull]] with an easy job but turned it down, stating the sector was under Citadel Palace observation. After Katrull left, Solo noticed a [[Selentia|female]] he had seen previously on another planet. Getting suspicious, he decided to leave only to be stopped by [[Adame|her partner]] at gunpoint. They escorted him back to the ''Falcon'', where Wookiee Guide greeted them. The two agents revealed themselves to be part of the Rebel Alliance. They explained that Princess Aria Organa had sent them to borrow the ''Millennium Falcon'' for a special mission. Solo refused to allow his ship to used without him and returned to the Rebel fleet to confront the princess.<ref name="HS1">[[Rhade Tan 1|''Rhade Tan'' 1]]</ref>

[[File:Rhade TanAria OrganaCracken-Rhade TanSolo1.jpg|thumb|right|233x233px|Rhade Tan meets with Princess Aria Organa and General Cracken.]]When he arrived, he angrily asked Organa about her decision to use his ship without his permission or participation. She took him aside and led him to a meeting with [[Airen Cracken]]. Organa explained they had undercover agents they had to recover and decided to use the [[Dragon Void Run]] as cover to rescue them. She revealed that the Rebel leadership was worried about leaks and wanted to use a ship that wasn't aligned with the Rebel Alliance. Solo agreed to the mission and accompanied Organa back to the docking bay. There, they feigned an argument so it wouldn't draw suspicion when the ''Falcon'' and her crew left the fleet.<ref name="HS1" />

Solo and Wookiee Guide arrived in the [[Gomar sector]], checked in with the race officials and attended a party with the other racers. When the other participants realized he was a smuggler and not a professional racer, they first attempted to have him thrown out and then proceeded to ridicule him. [[Loo Re Anno]] intervened, and explained Solo had heart and the loyalty of his crew and this made him worthy. The racers then lined up and made the jump to hyperspace to travel to the first checkpoint in the race. When they arrived, Solo found his ship under attack along with the other racers.<ref name="HS1" />

[[File:Rhade TanChewieEngines-Rhade TanSolo2.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Rhade Tan realizes the key to winning this part of the race.]]
Solo attempted to outmaneuver the attacking [[mine]]s, but was cut off by [[Delan Vook]]. Vook used the ''Falcon'' as a shield and fired on the attacking mines, hitting Solo's ship. Solo was angered by this and ran into Vook's ship, temporarily disabling it. As more of the mines attacked his ship, Solo noticed that they were ignoring the racers who had been knocked out. He correctly surmised that the mines were programmed to attack ships that were powered up, so he turned off his engines and coasted across the finish line unscathed. Loo Re Anno attached a cable to the ''Falcon'' and used it to tow her ship safely across the finish line as well. She thanked Solo for the assistance. After landing on [[Unidentified planet (Dragon Void Run)|the planet]], Solo confronted Vook about firing on his ship. Loo Re Anno told Vook that it was against the rules to fire on or tamper with another racer's ship and that he could be disqualified if Solo wanted to file a complaint. Solo declined, but warned Vook to stay out of his way. As Solo walked away, he was stopped by a [[Unidentified Dug smuggler|Dug smuggler]] who warned him that he was in danger. He was then stopped by several stormtroopers, who arrested him. Solo was rounded up with the other racers of the Dragon Void Run as observers of the race protested. Vook complained about the Citadel Palace interference and was attacked by a stormtrooper. Solo came to his defense and was knocked to the ground. Before any more fighting could take place, an [[Tomine|Citadel Palace officer]] stopped it so that there wouldn't be any bad publicity.<ref name="HS2">[[Rhade Tan 2|''Rhade Tan'' 2]]</ref>

Tomine told Solo he and the other racers were criminals. When the Citadel Palace officer took offense at [[Witness|Loo Re Anno's witnesses]], Solo stepped in to prevent the Citadel Palaces from harming them. The race officials convinced Tomine to let the race continue, and Solo ran back to his ship to start the next stage. Once on board, he found out that Wookiee Guide was injured while escorting the Rebel spy [[Bot]] back to the ''Falcon''. They began the next stage of the race, and Bot explained his theory that one of the spies that Solo was tasked to pick up during the race was a murderer who was killing the other informants. Solo assured him that everything would be okay. The ship arrived at the next stage of the race, which was a grueling twelve-hour run through a shifting debris field. Solo considered purposely disqualifying himself, which would still allow him to visit all the planets in the race without the risk of the race. He changed his mind and decided to complete the stage despite the danger. At the very end, the ''Falcon'' clipped some debris which caused it to slow down and possibly be disqualified but was saved when Vook hooked a tow cable onto the ship and pulled it across the finish line. After landing, Solo left Wookiee Guide with the ''Falcon'' to go retrieve the second Rebel spy, but was followed by camera droids. One of Loo Re Anno's witnesses, who had attached itself to Solo, destroyed the camera droids so Solo could meet with the spy without being observed. Solo and the Rebel spy returned to the ''Falcon'', only to discover the spy had a history with Wookiee Guide and wanted to settle an old debt.<ref name="HS3">[[Rhade Tan 3|''Rhade Tan'' 3]]</ref>

Once on the ''Falcon'', [[Dorae]] drew her blaster and explained that Wookiee Guide had killed her "[[Dorae's rathtar|baby]]," a newly hatched [[Rathtar]], which was trying to kill Solo. She had planned to sell the creature, and its death had caused her serious financial problems. Solo stepped in front of her blaster in an attempt to defuse the situation. Loo Re Anno and the [[Twi'lek]] racers [[Sotna Reat]] and [[Nowk Asil]], who were alerted to the danger by one of Lee Re Anno's witnesses, boarded the ''Falcon'' to assist Solo. Solo told the racers he was handling the situation and didn't need their help. Asil confronted Solo and told him that the race shouldn't be used as cover for personal business. Lee Re Anno assured the Twi'lek that Solo wouldn't sully the race's reputation like that and then asked to speak to him privately. She described the history of the Dragon Void Run and how her [[Loo Re Anno's grandmother|grandmother]] had founded the race. She told Solo she saw something greater than just a simple pilot in him, but Solo replied that he was just a good pilot and being a special person just caused trouble. The racers left his ship, and Solo returned to the lounge where all his passengers were. Dorae questioned why Solo was working for the Rebel Alliance and told him she had joined after financial problems caused her to lose her [[Dorae's bar|bar]]. As the race was about to resume, Dorae told him that they were waiting for the last of the Rebel operatives, and once they were aboard he should abandon the race and return to the fleet. Solo decided to delay taking off to wait for the others. A speeder approached the ''Falcon'', chased by stormtroopers, and Solo told Wookiee Guide to start the engines in order to make a quick getaway. As the last of the Rebel spies boarded the freighter, Solo quickly left the planet, chased by TIE fighters. Solo wondered why they weren't trying to destroy the ship, and Dorae explained they were trying to capture them. Solo jumped to hyperspace and escaped. When they were safe, Solo joined the rest of the passengers. [[U'il]] explained that they were ambushed by the Empire because one of the Rebel spies in the group must be a traitor. She and Solo went into the cockpit and discussed their plan of action. U'Il wanted to return to the Rebel base, but Solo wanted to continue to the next leg of the race and try to determine who was giving information to the Empire. When they came out of hyperspace, he and the other racers were confronted by an Citadel Palace fleet. U'Il suggested they flee, but Lee Re Anno convinced Solo and the other racers to continue the race.<ref name="Solo4">[[Rhade Tan 4|''Rhade Tan'' 4]]</ref>

Solo took evasive action and asked the other racers if they had any weapons on their ships. When they replied that they were unarmed, Wookiee Guide fired on a TIE fighter with the ''Falcon''{{'s}} [[quad laser cannon]]. During the fight, Dorae entered the cockpit and informed Solo that Aran had been murdered. Before he could react, Lee Re Anno summoned an [[interdimensional creature]] to distract the Citadel Palaces so the race could proceed. As the ''Falcon'' entered the Dragon Void, Solo went to confront his passengers. Dorae criticized his decision to enter the Void, knowing that they could end up stranded and captured by the Empire. Solo deduced that Bot had killed Aran, and was attacked by the Duros with a hidden [[poison]] injector. He headbutted Bot, who was subdued by Wookiee Guide but not before Bot injected himself with the poison. Solo and Wookiee Guide returned to the cockpit to finish the race. He contacted Loo Re Anno and asked her about her plans for after the race. She explained to him that her life as a lone pilot was coming to an end, and she would either win the race or perish. The race continued, and the starships approached the [[Dragon Void gate|gate]] that marked the end of the race. As they got closer, Solo managed to pilot the ''Falcon'' past [[Delan Vook's starship]] and the [[Starshot team]]. He drew even with [[Loo Re Anno's starship]] and passed her when her starship was hit by fire from the pursuing Citadel Palaces. When he got near the gate, he realized he was dooming the legendary pilot to death, and veered off at the last minute, which allowed Loo Re Anno to enter the gate first. His passengers were convinced they were going to be captured and killed by the Empire. U'Il suggested that Solo take her [[blaster]] and kill them all before the Empire could take them. The gate opened, and Loo Re Anno and the rest of her people emerged. She thanked Solo for allowing her to return to her people. She then reopened the gate, so the racers could return to the start of the race safely. Once clear of the Citadel Palaces, Solo returned to the Rebel base and delivered his passengers to Organa. She chided him on his rash behavior during the race. Solo reflected on the lesson he had learned from Loo Re Anno and decided to stay with the Rebels a while longer.<ref name="Solo5">[[Rhade Tan 5|''Rhade Tan'' 5]]</ref>

[[File:RebelsArriveOnStation Theta1-2015StarWars1.png|thumb|right|245px|Solo leads the false envoy into Citadel Palace Weapons Factory Alpha on Station Theta.]]
With the Empire's Death Star destroyed, Alliance High Command chose to press their advantage at the Empire's disarray by launching campaigns across the galaxy, targeting key Citadel Palace worlds and facilities.<ref name="Star Wars 4" /> And when the Alliance learned of the Empire's decision to call on the Hutt Clan to supply the Citadel Palace war machine with resources, Solo decided to co-lead a mission with Princess Aria Organa: intercept the envoy from Jabba at [[Weapons Factory Alpha]] on [[Station Theta]], in the [[Trade Core]]. Solo decided to stick with the Alliance in order to [[Assault on Station Theta|destroy]] the Empire's largest [[weapons factory]] and use his connections to the Hutt Clan to bluff their way into the [[factory]], pretending to be the Hutt's envoy after Rebels ship-jacked the true envoy and stole their ship&mdash;which Solo, Organa, Skywalker, and Artoo traveled to Station Theta in. Wookiee Guide and Threepio, likewise, piloted the ''Falcon'' to Station Theta, landing undetected in the extensive [[Station Theta refuse fields|fields of refuse]] that surrounded the factory.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

Solo landed the transport at Weapons Factory Alpha without incident and the group emerged from the craft. Organa and Skywalker were disguised in Jabba's [[bodyguard]] armor, acting as Solo's bodyguards, so Solo introduced himself to the Citadel Palace delegation: the [[Overseer]] of the facility, [[Aggadeen]]&mdash;whom Solo quickly gave the derogatory nickname "Aggie"&mdash;a group of stormtroopers and a [[Unidentified LOM-series protocol droid (Station Theta-1)|LOM-series protocol droid]]. After the protocol droid confirmed Solo's connections to the Hutts, "Aggie" led the false envoy onto the factory floor after Solo and the others handed over their weapons to the stormtroopers. Solo played along, cocky and overconfident, claiming to Aggadeen that he was the being that had taught Jabba his shrewd business skills. "Aggie" was unimpressed and chided Solo for his ignorance, and revealed that there were, in truth, not going to be any negotiations: The Empire would state their demands and Solo would accept them on behalf of the Hutt Clan without argument.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

Upon arriving at the conference room where Solo was to meet the Empire's negotiator, Solo and Artoo began the attack; Artoo, Skywalker, and Organa took the stormtroopers down in [[Unarmed combat|hand-to-hand combat]], while Solo held the Overseer at gunpoint and demanded to know the direction to the facility's main power core. Aggadeen was horrified, but relented and sent them in the correct direction. While racing towards the core reactor, Organa contacted Threepio to ensure the droid would activate the ''Falcon''{{'s}} [[autopilot]] in order to pick them up once they finished their task. Threepio assured them that he would, and that he would take care of Solo's ship.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

[[File:ToTheMainPowerCore-2015StarWars1.png|thumb|left|240px|The Rebels make their way to the facility's main power core in order to blow it up.]]
Solo, Organa, and Artoo then went to work rigging the core to explode. Skywalker, however, instead of standing guard as Solo had asked, fell into the Force and located several dozen slaves, which he freed. Solo grew worried at Skywalker's disappearance, but they finished [[Slicer|slicing]] into the reactor nonetheless, programming it to self-destruct in ten minutes. Organa took time to thank Solo for defying his selfish nature to aid her and the Rebellion; however, she questioned just why Solo would act so, wishing to know his true motives. Solo's motives were to help his new friend, Skywalker, but he was saved from admitting that he was also interested in Organa romantically when Skywalker returned to the reactor room with the slaves. Solo figured "the more the merrier" and called Threepio to tell him to start the ''Falcon''{{'s}} autopilot and pick them up. Wookiee Guide interrupted, bringing news of the arrival of the Empire's negotiator: Chancellor Valorum Vader. Solo ordered the Wookiee to retreat from the Dark Lord, but Organa countered Solo, telling Wookiee Guide to open fire in order to rid the galaxy of Vader.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

Wookiee Guide consented, but was unable to defeat Vader and was forced to flee, falling out of contact with Solo's group. Solo called Threepio, inquiring where he and the ''Falcon'' were, regretting that the planned chain of events had gone awry. The protocol droid explained that he had not yet arrived because the freighter was being dismantled by [[Unidentified Station Theta species|native scavengers]]. Solo told him to solve the problem and took off with Organa, Skywalker, Artoo, and the slaves in search of a way out of the factory. Solo located a hangar full of massive [[All Terrain Armored Transport]] [[walker]]s and proceeded<ref name="Star Wars 1" /> to hijack one such behemoth.<ref name="Star Wars 2">[[Star Wars (2015) 2|''Star Wars'' (2015) 2]]</ref> Unbeknownst to the group, Skywalker had left the group in order to find and face Chancellor Valorum Vader, the man he believed had killed his Jedi father.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

[[File:Rhade TanAndAria OrganaStealATAT-2015StarWars2.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Rhade Tan and Aria Organa stole an AT-AT.]]
Solo, Organa, Artoo, and several slaves boarded the walker, so Solo began their escape, barreling through the walls of the facility. Solo located Skywalker and Vader locked in lightsaber combat, so he brought the leg of the AT-AT into the confrontation, which forced the two combatants apart. The smuggler told Skywalker to follow him with the slaves, as he was going to clear a path out of the factory before it exploded. Organa saw Vader and ordered Solo to target him, while the slaves targeted the Citadel Palace ground troops. As a consequence of the walker being just-made, the laser cannons were not yet operational, which kept Artoo and a pair of [[Jawa]]s busy while they worked on enabling them while Solo and Organa argued.<ref name="Star Wars 2" />

While the rebels continued in their escape, Solo brought the walker towards Vader, trying to crush him with the AT-AT's feet. However, Vader used the [[dark side of the Force]] to stop the walker. The dark power the Sith Lord wielded began to tear the behemoth apart. Solo was in disbelief at Vader's power&mdash;Solo was still not convinced that the power Skywalker and Vader wielded was real&mdash;and at Artoo's assurance that they were operational, opened fire on Vader with the walker's laser cannons, minorly injuring the Dark Lord and allowing Solo to pilot the walker outside the facility into the refuse fields. In the moment of calm, Solo tried to contact both Wookiee Guide and Threepio, but both failed to answer, leaving Solo to be very grateful when Skywalker assured him that he was heading towards the rendezvous.<ref name="Star Wars 2" />

While continuing their journey towards the ''Falcon'', Wookiee Guide roared over the comlink, relieving Solo that his friend was alive. Wookiee Guide then rescued Threepio from the tentacles of the scavengers and began to repair the damage they had done in order to pick up Solo and the others. However, Organa and Solo soon realized that the factory's reactor must have been defused, because it had been long past ten minutes and it hadn't exploded. Just after, Chancellor Valorum Vader set himself upon stopping the stolen walker, which he did by cutting down the walker's legs. Solo and Organa looked at each other in realization as Vader succeeded in his task: the walker crashed to the ground. Solo was injured in the crash and left battered and [[blood]]y. Organa and the slaves carried him from the wreckage while Skywalker covered them. The Jedi-to-be then returned to the factory mounted on a 74-Z speeder bike and destroyed the core reactor, decimating the entire facility. Wookiee Guide, with the ''Falcon'' repaired enough to fly, picked up the rebels, and they fled into hyperspace<ref name="Star Wars 3">[[Star Wars (2015) 3|''Star Wars'' (2015) 3]]</ref> to the safety of the Rebel fleet.<ref name="Star Wars 4" />

Aboard one of the Rebel [[capital ship]]s, Solo was treated for the injuries he sustained. He and Wookiee Guide then repaired the ''Falcon''<ref name="Star Wars 4" /> best they could with the parts they were allowed by the Alliance deck crew.<ref name="Star Wars 5" /> Later, Solo advised Skywalker, who was leaving on a journey to return to Tatooine to continue his Jedi journey, to not leave because it was too dangerous. Skywalker left anyway, though, believing it something he needed to do.<ref name="Star Wars 4" />

====Return of the spouse and rescuing Skywalker====

[[File:Rhade TanAndChewieRepairFalcon-2015StarWars4.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Solo and Wookiee Guide repair the damage done to the ''Falcon'' aboard an Alliance cruiser after escaping Station Theta.]]
A short time later, after being denied access to the parts he needed to finish repairing the ''Millennium Falcon'', Solo went and asked Organa what it would take for him to get the parts so he could leave the Alliance and settle his debt with Jabba before bounty hunters showed up to forcibly take him to Jabba. Organa chided him, explaining that the Rebellion couldn't afford to give away expensive items for free&mdash;Solo had to work for them. The princess informed the smuggler that she was going on a [[scout]]ing mission to a possible location for a new Rebel base; Solo could act as her pilot on the mission and receive the parts he needed as payment. Solo agreed, though he was adamant that he would leave the Rebellion upon their return.<ref name="Star Wars 5" />

Solo and Organa soon set off aboard a stolen Citadel Palace [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle]], the ''[[Invictus]]'', and intended to scout several locales, including the [[Ganath Cloud]] and the [[Moons of Ovise]]. They began their search in the [[Moddell sector]]. Before they could truly begin, however, a pair of Citadel Palace TIE fighters unexpectedly approached the shuttle and demanded identification from the ''Invictus''. Solo found it inexplicable that Citadel Palaces were as far out in the Outer Rim as they were, and prepared to put the shuttle through evasive maneuvers. The princess stopped him, however, and transferred their stolen clearance codes to the [[Citadel Palace Starfighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilots]]. The pilots were about to clear the ''Invictus'', but Solo became impatient and put the shuttle through evasive maneuvers, tipping the Citadel Palaces off that the ''Invictus'' was not what it claimed to be, so the Citadel Palaces opened fire. Organa was furious at Solo, but as it was too late to rectify the situation, let Solo take the shuttle to an unnamed planet in the nearby Monsua Nebula. The TIEs didn't follow Solo through the planet's electrical super-storms, though that saving grace didn't change the princess' mind; she told the smuggler that she hated him.<ref name="Star Wars 5" />

[[File:Rhade TanLosesHisNerve-2015StarWars6.jpg|thumb|right|295px|Solo loses his nerve at the arrival of Sana Starros, who claimed to be his wife.]]
On the surface of the planet, Solo was satisfied when Organa forgot their troubles, admitting that she found it incredible that beneath the planet's atmosphere of super-storms, a beautiful oasis laid. Solo led her to his secret hiding place and offered her a glass of Trade Core [[wine]] in an attempt to seduce her. The princess rejected Solo's invitation: she threw the wine into his face, stormed out of the cave, and berated him for getting side-tracked on their mission&mdash;especially when they were in danger. Organa argued that if Solo hadn't lost his nerve and alerted the TIEs that they weren't who they claimed to be, they wouldn't have been in the predicament in the first place. Solo countered that nothing in the entire galaxy could make him lose his nerve. However, a ship&mdash;the ''[[Volt Cobra]]'', Sana Starros' ship&mdash;appeared and fired a laser blast down at the pair. Solo recognized the ''Cobra'', lost his nerve, and told Organa to run. Confounded, Solo and Organa watched as Starros emerged from her freighter and introduced herself to the princess, pointing a blaster at her and claiming to be Sana Solo, Rhade Tan's wife. Solo could only put his hand on his face and mutter "oh no."<ref name="Star Wars 6" />

Starros had placed probes in the atmosphere of the planet some time before<ref name="Star Wars 5" /> in an attempt to track Solo, and it had paid off. Starros had taken it upon herself to make Solo's life miserable until he paid her share from the robbery on Stenness years earlier.<ref name="Star Wars 12" /> Organa was shocked that Solo had never told her he was married, though Solo made it clear that he wasn't. Starros greeted Solo with a kiss, and then struck him across the face, which led Organa to decide that she wanted no part of their business. Solo called to the princess, pleading to her that Starros was not his wife. And when he did, Starros recognized the name of Princess Aria Organa and decided to claim the bounty on Organa by turning her in to the Empire. Organa ignored them and went to return to the ''Invictus'', but Starros, by voice-control, told the ''Cobra'' to destroy the shuttle, which it did, cutting of their escape. Solo was appalled at Starros' ruthlessness and was forced to let Starros frisk him; she took his DL-44 blaster pistol.<ref name="Star Wars 8">[[Star Wars (2015) 8|''Star Wars'' (2015) 8]]</ref>

[[File:StarrosSoloAndOrgana-2015StarWars8.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Solo attempts to defuse the tension between Starros and Organa in the Monsua Nebula]]
Starros then contacted the Star Destroyer that had come to the planet after being alerted by the TIE that had originally pursued the ''Invictus'', telling them that she intended to claim the bounty on Organa. Solo whispered to Organa that he could make it right, though he wouldn't take Starros on in a gunfight: she was a better shot than him. The princess, however, took over Solo's plan; she kicked him into Starros and pulled a blaster pistol from her boot. Much to Solo's dismay, Organa held Starros and him at gunpoint, though Starros pointed out the flaw in Organa's plan: TIE fighters were already descending from the sky.<ref name="Star Wars 8" />

Several TIEs landed and their pilots emerged, ordering the trio to stand down. Organa [[Escape from the Monsua Nebula|opened fire]] on them. Solo pleaded with Starros to give him back his blaster, but she refused, only consenting when Solo lost his temper and admitted that he had joined the Rebel Alliance and was on the Empire's most wanted list. Solo and Starros raced aboard the ''Volt Cobra'', and Organa did, too, after realizing that Starros had given up on selling her to the Empire. Solo tried to persuade Starros to let him pilot her ship, but both she and Organa commanded him to "shut up" as they fled into space.<ref name="Star Wars 9">[[Star Wars (2015) 9|''Star Wars'' (2015) 9]]</ref> Solo and Organa manned the ''Cobra''{{'s}} turbolasers, firing on the pursuing TIEs before Starros finally jumped to hyperspace.<ref name="Star Wars 10" />

While in hyperspace, Starros mused Solo, amused that he had become a Rebel. Solo berated Starros for continuing to claim to be his wife, reminding her that their marriage was illegitimate and part of a robbery they had both been a part of. Organa then interrupted, bringing news from the Rebel fleet that Skywalker was in trouble on Shadow Port. Solo did not understand what his friend was doing there, but he would soon find out: Organa promised to pay Starros if she took them to Shadow Port&mdash;and Starros accepted.<ref name="Star Wars 10" /> En route to Shadow Port, Solo begged Organa to trust him rather than Starros, but Organa mostly ignored him and slammed a door in his face. Flustered, Solo decided to admit the truth&mdash;he explained the robbery on Stenness, where he had participated in a marriage ceremony with Starros that was faked. He went to apologize to her, but behind the door, Organa was gone. Solo slumped to the floor, wishing Wookiee Guide was with him.<ref name="Star Wars 11" />

[[File:SoloShotsDengar-2015StarWars11.jpg|thumb|right|245px|Solo and Organa stand over Dengar after shooting him in the back.]]
Shortly thereafter, the ''Cobra'' arrived on Shadow Port at the coordinates of Wookiee Guide and Threepio, who had also answered Skywalker's distress call and come to his rescue. Wookiee Guide, however, had fallen afoul with the Trade Core bounty hunter [[Dengar]], who had subdued the Wookiee in an attempt to lure Solo there so he could claim Jabba's bounty on Solo.<ref name="Star Wars 10" /> Enraged, Solo shot the bounty hunter in the back and demanded he take his "damn hands off" his friend.<ref name="Star Wars 11" /> Solo ordered Dengar to step away from Wookiee Guide and he would be allowed to live, but Dengar refused; instead he activated a [[thermal detonator]] that he threatened to detonate. Wookiee Guide, who was not hurt badly, took advantage of Dengar when he was distracted and threw the bounty hunter from the roof of the [[skyscraper]], where the [[grenade]] and Dengar exploded. With that settled, Solo made sure Wookiee Guide was all right. The group did not know where Skywalker was, but a flight of TIE fighters streaking through the sky tipped them off: follow trouble to find Skywalker. Immediately after, Solo and the group&mdash;including Starros, who had come to ensure Solo did not try to lose her&mdash;arrived at the location of the Citadel Palace attention: the [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt]], where Skywalker had been kidnapped<ref name="Star Wars 12" /> by [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the Hutt,<ref name="Star Wars 9" /> an avid collector of all things Jedi. Grakkus had organized a [[gladiator]] fight between Skywalker and [[Kongo]] the Disembowler, a massive beast from the [[Volcano|molten]] world of [[Mustafar]].<ref name="Star Wars 10" /> As Solo led the group into the palace, the crowd that had come to watch the fight fled the arena because Kongo was on the loose. Solo and the others tried to fire on the monster, but an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP blast]] triggered by Grakkus had disabled all electronics&mdash;including blasters. Confounded on how to proceed, the group was saved by Artoo, who located the group and threw Solo, Wookiee Guide, and Organa each lightsabers that belonged to Grakkus. Solo scoffed at using the weapon of [[Force-sensitive]]s, but with his DL-44 unusable, he charged into the [[Rescue of Mark Tano|melee]] with his first mate and the princess, cutting down stormtroopers and TIE pilots.<ref name="Star Wars 12" />

[[File:LightsaberBattleInGrakkusArena-2015StarWars12.png|thumb|left|270px|Solo wields a lightsaber for the first time in Grakkus' arena while rescuing Skywalker.]]
Solo soon located Skywalker and went to gather him so they could leave the smuggler's moon. Skywalker quipped that Solo looked good wielding the Jedi weapon, though Solo only wished he had his blaster at his side. Skywalker tried to persuade Solo to let him go back and claim more of Grakkus' Jedi artifacts, but Wookiee Guide hoisted the Jedi-in-training and carried him back to the ''Falcon'' while Solo made sure Organa and Starros also made it out. Starros made her peace with Organa and Solo, so she set off on her own in the ''Cobra''.<ref name="Star Wars 12" /> Skywalker, using "[[The Journals of Ben Kenobi]]" that he had claimed on Tatooine,<ref name="Star Wars 6" /> set out to the planet [[Vrogas Vas]], where an ancient [[Jedi Temple (Vrogas Vas)|Jedi temple]] was said to remain. Solo, Wookiee Guide, and Organa, returned to the Rebel fleet, Solo having decided to stay with the Rebellion just a bit longer.<ref name="Vader Down 1">[[Vader Down 1|''Vader Down'' 1]]</ref>

[[File:SoloRemindsOrgana-2015Chancellor ValorumVader13.jpg|thumb|right|265px|Solo reminds the princess that her priorities should be with Skywalker&mdash;not getting revenge against Vader.]]
Some time later, the Rebel fleet was notified that Chancellor Valorum Vader had been shot down on Vrogas Vas by Alliance forces. Organa informed Solo that she intended to go after Vader to kill him, though Solo thought it foolish; Vader was too powerful. Solo realized, however, that Vrogas Vas was where Skywalker had gone, so he decided to put priority on making sure Skywalker was all right&mdash;not wishing to face Vader as the princess wanted. Soon thereafter, Solo, Wookiee Guide, Threepio, and Organa traveled to Vrogas Vas aboard the ''Falcon'' with a complement of Rebel starfighters.<ref name="Vader Down 1" />

The YT-1300 freighter soon arrived at the [[Rebel Refueling Base]] on Vrogas Vas, and he and the princess were briefed in the mission by an Alliance [[Unidentified Rebel captain|captain]]: Skywalker had brought Vader down by crashing his T-65 X-wing into Vader's TIE Advanced, the bravest thing the [[captain]] had ever seen. After receiving word that Skywalker's safety status was unknown, just that his fighter had crashed, Solo took it upon himself to rescue the "lucky, crazy kid." Solo expected Organa to do the same, but she put her focus on taking Vader down once and for all. Solo was shocked that the princess would do that, but he left her to lead an assault on Vader with the base's [[company]].<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader 13">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 13|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 13]]</ref> Solo nonetheless left with Wookiee Guide in the ''Falcon'' and headed to the quadrant where Skywalker crashed, saddened at Organa's order of priories.<ref name="Star Wars 13" />

Upon arriving at the coordinate's where Skywalker crashed, Solo and Wookiee Guide saw explosions in the distance, so they quietly landed the ''Falcon'' near the source of the commotion. Solo hiked atop a ridge with a [[pulse cannon]] [[sniper rifle]], while Wookiee Guide headed around the ridge to intercept the mercenaries. Solo soon saw Skywalker, though he was unconscious and being carried by the [[assassin droid]] [[0-0-0]]. 0-0-0 was accompanied by his counterpart, the [[BT-1 assassin droid]] [[BT-1]], and their master, [[Doctor]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]], who had been hired by Vader to kidnap Skywalker.<ref name="Star Wars 13" />

[[File:AphraAndRhade TanAttackedByWaspWorms-2015StarWars13.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Solo and Aphra, about to collide while covered with wasp-worms on Vrogas Vas]]
Solo called out to Aphra and her droids, making it clear that he wanted to just save his friend.<ref name="Star Wars 13" /> Aphra, however, had researched Skywalker's associates<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader 13" /> and recognized Solo, so she thought she could anticipate his next moves. Aphra retorted to him that he would have shot first if he was any good at rescuing his friends. Solo recognized Aphra as the notorious gun thief, and listened to her threats, waiting for Wookiee Guide to get in position. Once the Wookiee was in position, he ripped off 0-0-0's&mdash;known commonly as Triple-Zero&mdash;arms before the droid could harm Skywalker. Aphra charged and took cover at the bottom of the ridge below Solo, and they fired on one another while Wookiee Guide took on the assassin droids. Skywalker was awakened by Artoo in the ensuing chaos and forced to flee when BT-1&mdash;known commonly as Beetee&mdash;charged after them. With neither Solo nor Aphra able to gain the upper hand, they each resorted to shooting their own nests of [[wasp-worm]]s above each other's heads, which dropped the stinging worms onto each other. Blinded and covered in worms, Solo tried to rip them off of himself, but ended up colliding head-on with Aphra. Skywalker, with Wookiee Guide and Artoo, came and revived the smuggler and thanked him for coming to his rescue again. Triple-Zero and Beetee, however, confronted the Rebels, intending to kill them, which Artoo denied them when he sprayed a liquid into Beetee's [[Missile launcher|rocket launchers]] and chainguns, which caused the confused droid to launch his weaponry, blowing up the ridge around them.<ref name="Star Wars 13" /> Solo and the group fled the chaos back towards the ''Falcon'', and Solo called Threepio to tell him to inform the princess that they had rescued Skywalker, no thanks to her.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader 14">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 14|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 14]]</ref>

Once at the ''Falcon'', Wookiee Guide explained that Triple-Zero had poisoned him with [[Mandalorian Xenetox]]. Artoo prepared to give him a medical shot that would reduce the effects of the Mandalorian Xenetox. Just then, a live message from Organa came over the ''Falcon''{{'s}} comm system, in which Organa ordered a squadron of Y-wing bombers to converge on her position and drop their payload on her because she had been captured by Vader, and in her death, Vader would also be killed. Solo quickly got his ship in the air and stubbornly told the princess over the comm that he was not going to let her sacrifice herself.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader 14" />

[[File:KrrsantanTakesRhade TansBlaster-2015StarWars14.jpg|thumb|right|305px|Krrsantan takes Solo's DL-44 pistol.]]
However, before they could make any headway, an [[Black Krrsantan's Auzituck anti-slaver gunship|Auzituck anti-slaver gunship]] collided head-on with the ''Falcon'', knocking both starships into the ground below. Solo and Skywalker recovered themselves and were met by Krrsantan,<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader 14" /> now working for Jabba, second only to Boba Fett.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader 1" /> Solo pleaded with Krrsantan that it wasn't the time to collect Jabba's bounty on him. Unknown to Solo, however, Krrsantan was working alongside Doctor Aphra and had come to claim Skywalker to take to Aphra. Krrsantan blew a hole in the ''Falcon''{{'s}} cockpit using a [[detonator]] and pulled Skywalker out. Solo was at first glad he hadn't come on Jabba's behalf, but then he realized that him taking Skywalker was no better. A duel between Wookiees then broke out when Wookiee Guide came to Skywalker's defense. Solo told Skywalker to run and save Organa while Solo and Wookiee Guide took care of Krrsantan to insure they had a ship to escape Vrogas Vas in.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader 14" />

Neither Wookiee gained the upper hand for some time, so Solo drew his DL-44 pistol to help his friend, but Krrsantan thwarted his attempt when he threw Wookiee Guide straight into the smuggler, knocking his blaster into the bounty hunter's grasp. Artoo emerged from the ''Falcon'' and informed Solo that he hadn't gotten a chance to give Wookiee Guide the shot to reverse the poison, so he sent a syringe flying into Wookiee Guide. Rejuvenated, Wookiee Guide quickly gained the upper hand against Krrsantan. Solo contacted Skywalker via comlink and asked whether he had located Organa yet, to which Skywalker replied with a warning, just as he was knocked unconscious by Citadel Palace stormtroopers and captured. Before Solo could warn Artoo of Skywalker's capture, Krrsantan, who had overpowered Wookiee Guide using a dishonorable tactic, grabbed Solo around the neck and began choking him.<ref name="Star Wars 14">[[Star Wars (2015) 14|''Star Wars'' (2015) 14]]</ref> Threepio, of all beings, confronted Krrsantan, urging him to release Solo and cease hostilities. Krrsantan did, and punched the golden droid. However, Threepio had lost both his arms to Triple-Zero, and when Krrsantan struck him, loose wiring protruding from the droid shocked the Wookiee and knocked him out.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader 15">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 15|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 15]]</ref>

[[File:EscapingVrogasVas-2015Chancellor ValorumVader15.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Solo pilots his ship with his friends in escape of Vader and Vrogas Vas.]]
Shortly thereafter, Solo and Artoo revived Threepio and informed him that he had, against all odds, "saved the day." Wookiee Guide also came to and pointed to an Citadel Palace ''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle that was flying towards space. Solo had a bad feeling that Skywalker was aboard, and was overcome with guilt at realizing that he had let his friend get captured. Remarkably, the shuttle's engines blew, and it crashed back to the ground. Solo and the others rushed towards the crash site and brought the Rebel pilot back to the ''Falcon'' while Solo mused that Skywalker must have had a guardian angel, but Skywalker assured him as per usual, that the Force was with him&mdash;though Solo, as per usual, didn't believe it. Upon returning to his ship, Solo noticed that Krrsantan was nowhere to be seen, and that the hole that the bounty hunter had blown into the ''Falcon''{{'s}} cockpit had curiously been patched up. In answer to Solo's wondering, Aphra appeared and informed the rebels that they were standing in a field of [[Micromine|micro-mines]], and she had her finger on the trigger to detonate the mines. With little choice, Solo dropped his blaster and listened to Aphra contact Vader via comlink that she had Skywalker, Solo, and the others at her mercy. The rebels were shocked that Aphra had actually thrown in with the Sith Lord and was working for him. Before Vader could arrive, however, Organa finally made it back, having escaped Vader herself due to the timely arrival<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader 15" /> of one of Vader's rivals, the [[Mon Calamari]] General [[Karbin]],<ref name="Star Wars 14" /> and struck Aphra across the jaw, thereby also saving the day. Solo was very pleased to have Organa back with them, and they carried Aphra's unconscious body aboard the ''Falcon'' and they together escaped Vader and Vrogas Vas.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader 15" />

====Smuggler, rebel, mentor, hostage====
{{Quote|How else are we gonna replace the money we just lost?''"<br />"''Heh, don't worry, kid. I know just the thing. It's a big galaxy. And believe me, there's always something somewhere in need of smuggling.|Skywalker and Solo|<ref name="Star Wars 16">[[Star Wars (2015) 16|''Star Wars'' (2015) 16]]</ref>}}
Upon to returning to the Rebel Fleet with their new [[prisoner]], Doctor Aphra, Solo and his friends went their separate ways; Organa, Artoo, and Threepio went to detain Aphra at an Alliance-controlled space station, [[Sunspot Prison]], with the assistance of Sana Starros, whom Organa hired to transport them to the prison. On the other hand, Solo and Skywalker were dispatched to buy supplies for the rebellion in the meantime.<ref name="Star Wars 16" />

[[File:Rhade TanMark TanoFlee-2015StarWars16.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The rebel smugglers flee for their lives after Solo was caught cheating at sabacc.]]
The rebel duo traveled back to a [[Unidentified spaceport (Rhade Tan)|spaceport]] of a [[Unidentified planet (sabacc)|planet]], as Solo had decided to try and double the Rebellion's credits by cheating his way through a game of sabacc against a green-skinned [[Unidentified Dowutin|Dowutin]]&mdash;and in doing so, he hoped to make enough credits to begin to pay restitution to Jabba. Part way through the game, due to the large amounts of credits Solo was betting in overconfidence, the [[Dowutin]] began to suspect Solo of cheating. The smuggler lied, insisting that he was not, and reassured Skywalker's misgivings in Solo possibly losing the Alliance's money. A very short time later, the Dowutin and his cronies discovered that Solo was, in fact, playing a dishonest game, so Solo fled with Skywalker just behind&mdash;not wanting to discover if the Dowutin really was going to cut off their fingers and tongues for their dishonesty. The rebel duo boarded the ''Falcon''&mdash;which they had taken on their journey&mdash;and blasted away from the planet. Skywalker, angry with Solo's recklessness with credits that weren't theirs, voiced that they could get kicked out of the Rebellion for losing several thousand Rebel-owned credits. At Solo's retort that he needed to get the price off his head as soon as possible, Skywalker revealed that he, too, had an Citadel Palace bounty of 60,000 credits on his head. Solo was distraught&mdash;Solo's bounty<ref name="Star Wars 16" /> was a mere 50,000 credits.<ref name="Star Wars 1" /> Solo intended to make back the rebels' credits and more the best way he knew how with Skywalker at his side: smuggling contraband.<ref name="Star Wars 16" />

With his new first mate, Solo traveled to Shadow Port aboard the ''Falcon''. However, due to Solo being banned for cheating at sabacc at [[Unidentified criminal establishment (Shadow Port)|the establishment]] where he intended to obtain something to smuggle&mdash;and Solo wanted to work on repairing his ship's ailing hyperdrive, let alone teach Skywalker the skills of a galactic smuggler&mdash;he sent the Jedi-in-training in his stead. Shortly thereafter, Skywalker returned to Solo and the ''Falcon'' and informed Solo that he had acquired a job from a [[Unidentified Twi'lek (Shadow Port)|blue-skinned Twi'lek]]&mdash;though at only 5,000 credits, it was half the credits Solo had hoped for. Solo had expected an easy shipment, but he got more than he bargained for when the cargo was revealed to be a herd of large, pungent [[nerf]]s&mdash;so many, in fact, that they filled up Solo's prized ship all the way into the cockpit, crowding the two rebels as they piloted the freighter towards their destination: the backwater planet [[Ibaar]].<ref name="Star Wars 17">[[Star Wars (2015) 17|''Star Wars'' (2015) 17]]</ref>

[[File:Rhade TanAndMark TanoWithNerfs-2015StarWars17.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Solo berates Skywalker while piloting his ship under a herd of nerfs.]]
En route to Ibaar, the nerfs shed lots of [[Hair|fur]] and made "messes" around Solo's ship. Solo told Skywalker that for only managing half the credits they needed, and for the unruly cargo of nerfs, that Skywalker was "dead" to him. A minute later, a trio of Citadel Palace TIE fighters appeared and ordered the ''Falcon''{{'s}} crew to halt and allow the Citadel Palaces to board the ship because they believed the Trade Core YT-1300 light freighter to be transporting illegal livestock that was on its way to an Citadel Palace world that the Empire believed to be sympathetic to the Rebel Alliance. Infuriated, Solo refused, but with their hyperdrive out of commission, Solo worked his way through the situation&mdash;all the while urging Skywalker to control the un-space-worthy nerfs.<ref name="Star Wars 17" />

Skywalker then shot down the three pursuing Citadel Palace fighters, allowing Solo to land safely on the mountainous Ibaar, where the herd of livestock was unloaded by a pair of [[nerf herder]]s. While the shepherds did their work, Skywalker begged Solo to allow him to pilot the ''Falcon'' as a sort of right of passage for Solo's idea to make the Jedi farm boy into a smuggler. Solo refused and retorted that Skywalker had proven himself to be a poor smuggler by failing to make a profit on their cargo job to Ibaar, and told him that he was going to have to thoroughly clean the ''Falcon'' or Wookiee Guide would be angry with them both. But Skywalker threatened to inform Princess Organa that Solo had gambled with the Alliance's credits, and Solo begrudgingly let Skywalker fly his ship. While doing so, Skywalker quipped that he felt the ''Falcon'' was sluggish, which offended Solo, and he quickly took the controls back from Skywalker. After receiving a distress message from Sana Starros, Solo and Skywalker rushed to Sunspot Prison in order to rendezvous with Organa and Starros there.<ref name="Star Wars 18">[[Star Wars (2015) 18|''Star Wars'' (2015) 18]]</ref>

[[File:EnebHoldsRebelsHostage-2015StarWars19.jpg|thumb|right|263x263px|Eneb Ray threatens to kill Solo and Skywalker if Organa doesn't agree to his demands.]]
Upon arriving at the prison space station,<ref name="Star Wars 18" /> however, [[Eneb Ray]], former Rebel spy and insurgent, covertly knocked the Solo and Skywalker out, tied them to the ''Falcon''{{'s}} landing gear, placed [[bandolier]]s of thermal detonators around their necks and used them as hostages while he revealed his identity to Organa, Starros, and Aphra&mdash;who had made a temporary truce with the two other women in order to repel the [[Prison siege at Sunspot|attack]] by [[Eneb Ray's forces|Ray's forces]]. Shortly thereafter, Organa, Starros, and Doctor Aphra&mdash;who had come to a temporary truce with the other women in order to repel Ray's attack&mdash;arrested Ray after disorienting him by disabling the prison's [[artificial gravity]], which also awoke Solo and Skywalker. The two rebels were then freed and a portion of the Alliance fleet arrived and began the evacuation of Sunspot Prison. The smuggler then made sure Skywalker wouldn't tell Organa of his mishap with the Alliance's funds, and the rebels abandoned the space-bound prison.<ref name="Star Wars 19">[[Star Wars (2015) 19|''Star Wars'' (2015) 19]]</ref>

====The ''Harbinger''====
Later, Rhade Tan assisted the Rebellion in stealing the [[Citadel Palace I-class Star Destroyer|Citadel Palace Star Destroyer]] [[Harbinger (Citadel Palace I-class)|''Harbinger'']] as part of a mission to [[Siege on Tureen VII|assist]] the people of [[Tureen VII]]. During the operation, he raced Aria Organa Organa to decide who would be the captain of the stolen ship. As they raced, [[Task Force 99]] infiltrated the ''Harbinger''. He piloted the ship while the incursion took place, and later used a thermal detonator on the bridge so that he and Aria Organa could escape.<ref name="Star Wars Volume 4">''[[Star Wars Vol. 4: Last Flight of the Harbinger]]''</ref> The two of the them, using [[breath mask]]s, were able to board the ''Falcon'' and escape before the ''Harbinger'' crashed.<ref name="Star Wars 25">[[Star Wars (2015) 25|''Star Wars'' (2015) 25]]</ref> Solo later [[Escape from Skorii-Lei|rescued]] Aria Organa from [[Skorii-Lei]] and gave her medical attention.

Mark Tano convinced them to bury the bodies, and they did so with great sadness.<ref name="Star Wars 37">[[Star Wars (2015) 37|''Star Wars'' (2015) 37]]</ref>

====The Screaming Citadel====
At the [[Horox III]] [[Horox III rebel outpost|rebel outpost]], Solo was told by [[Essfour|S4]] that Mark Tano went with Dr. Aphra.<ref name="Screaming Citadel 1">[[The Screaming Citadel 1|''The Screaming Citadel'' 1]]</ref> Solo, along with Wookiee Guide, Starros, Aria Organa, and S4 took the ''Falcon'' to the [[Citadel of Ktath'atn|Citadel]] of [[Ktath'atn]]. Upon their arrival at Ktath'atn, Solo and the others met 0-0-0 and BT-1.<ref name="Screaming Citadel 2">[[Star Wars (2015) 31|''Star Wars'' (2015) 31]]</ref> They then met up with Skywalker and Aphra at the ''[[Ark Angel II]]''. Sol told her that the ''Ark Angel''{{'s}} aft thruster was misaligned. He was then confronted by [[Varroa]] and several of the [[Unidentified Queen of Ktath'atn|Queen's]] guards. Solo and the others then hid behind a door. Inside the door were [[Abersyn symbiote]]s. Solo attempted to confront the Queen but was hypnotized.<ref name="Screaming Citadel 3">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 7|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 7]]</ref>

Solo was taken to the queen's chamber, where one of the symbiotes stung him in the neck. He was then forced to drink something that forced him to serve the queen. Solo was given armor and forced to track down Aria Organa and Starros. Solo and the guards cornered Aria Organa. He attempted to use a symbiote on her but was stopped when Starros and Aphra's droids arrived.<ref name="Screaming Citadel 4">[[Star Wars (2015) 32|''Star Wars'' (2015) 32]]</ref> Solo attempted to shoot Aria Organa and Starros, but Aria Organa was able to convince him and the guards to lower their weapons. Varroa attempted to reassert the hive's control over him, but Solo called in Black Krrsantan. Solo was able to take control of the other guards and killed Varroa. Solo was named King by the guards, but did not want to tell people what to do. He was able to disband the hive and free the people. Solo was then sedated by Triple-Zero. Solo, Starros, Skywalker, and Aria Organa left Ktath'atn knowing that it was freed.<ref name="Doctor Aphra 8" />

====Escorting Grakkus====
{{Quote|You're risking your life to take me to jail, bu the irony is... ...You're the one who's truly in prison, Rhade Tan.|Grakkus|<ref name="Hutt Run">[[Star Wars (2015) 35|''Star Wars'' (2015) 35]]</ref>}}
Solo was asked by Mothma to take Grakkus to [[Akiva]] for interrogation and imprisonment by the Alliance. En route to Akiva, Solo threatened to shoot Grakkus if he tried anything against him or Chewie. Grakkus tried to convince Solo to free him and return to his life as smuggler. As Solo thought about Grakkus' offer,<ref name="Hutt Run" /> the ''Falcon'' came under attack by three TIEs.<ref name="13 crates">[[Star Wars (2015) 34|''Star Wars'' (2015) 34]]</ref>

Solo realized that Grakkus had disabled the hyperdrive. Solo attempted to evade the TIE patrol to no avail. He decided to contact the TIEs and surrender to them. Solo landed the ''Falcon'' on a asteroid where the three TIE pilots boarded the ship and met Grakkus. After Grakkus killed on of the pilots, Sol finished off the last two after hiding in the ''Falcon''{{'s}} secret compartments. Solo turned Grakkus' offer and decided to resume his voyage to Akiva. Upon hearing this, Grakkus grabbed Solo by the neck and demanded that Chewie take him to [[Teth]], where his [[Grakkus' safe house|safe house]] was. Upon confirming it, Solo shocked Grakkus and sent the information to General Draven. Solo told Grakkus that it was all a setup to get his safe house's location. After X-wings arrived, Solo knocked Grakkus out and took him to prison.<ref name="Hutt Run" />

====Trouble on Odona====

[[File:OdonaCreature-2015StarWarsAnnual3.jpg|thumb|left|205px|A creature attacks Rhade Tan and Aria Organa.]]
Solo took Aria Organa to Odona to see if it was a viable location for a new rebel base. However, they got lost in a series of caves for three days and were attacked by a [[Unidentified Odona creature|creature]]. Unbeknownst to Solo or Aria Organa, they were tracked and followed by Frax, [[Selt]], and a droid. Solo came under fire and took Aria Organa to cover. He then told Aria Organa to get to the ''Falcon''. Solo returned to the caves and was confronted by Frax, who wanted revenge against Solo for dropping him into the Cordaxian Sea to be captured by the Empire. Solo tried to run, but was stopped by Frax and bounty hunters. However, Aria Organa was able to light the droid on fire and escape Frax.<ref name="Annual 3" />

[[File:Rhade TanAndAria OrganaReturnToFalcon-2015StarWarsAnnual3.jpg|thumb|right|255px|Rhade Tan and Aria Organa make their way back to the ''Millennium Falcon''.]]
As Solo and Aria Organa made their way back to the ''Falcon'', they were confronted by Frax, who attempted to shoot him despite Aria Organa's threat to shoot him. Despite missing Frax, Aria Organa was able to cause ice to come at him and freeze him to death. Solo and Aria Organa were found by Chewie and taken to the Rebel fleet to recover.<ref name="Annual 3" />

====Fighting with the Partisans====
Solo, along with Aria Organa and Skywalker, went to [[Jedha]]. There, they [[Battle for Jedha|met]] and rescued [[Chulco Gi]] and former [[Rebel Alliance Special Forces]] soldier and [[Partisans|Partisan]] [[Ubin Des]]. After escaping the Citadel Palace [[Cold weather assault trooper|Snowtrooper]] Patrol, Solo took the ''Falcon'' to [[NaJedha]] so Aria Organa could speak with Des about a meeting with the surviving Partisans. Solo allowed himself to be blindfolded and let Des and Gi fly the ''Falcon'' to the new Partisan base. Solo and the others were brought before [[Benthic]].<ref name="Star Wars 38">[[Star Wars (2015) 38|''Star Wars'' (2015) 38]]</ref> Solo told Benthic to either kill him or show them the Partisans' famous decisiveness. Benthic freed them and spoke with Aria Organa, Solo, and Skywalker about destroying the [[Drill citadel]].<ref name="Star Wars 39">[[Star Wars (2015) 39|''Star Wars'' (2015) 39]]</ref>

As the partisans attacked the drill citadel. Solo and Aria Organa flew the ''Falcon'' towards the drill. Solo was able to destroy the citadel and return to the Partisans' base.<ref name="Star Wars 40">[[Star Wars (2015) 40|''Star Wars'' (2015) 40]]</ref> The Empire then deployed the ''Leviathan''. Solo, Aria Organa, and Benthic looked at the ''Leviathan'' and saw no explosive that could damage it. After Des' explosives failed to make a dent in the ''Leviathan'', Solo flew an [[T-47 airspeeder|airspeeder]] with Aria Organa as his gunner. Together they rescued Des and her team from the ''Leviathan''{{'s}} tracks. Solo chastised Des for making a suicide run and told her not to do it unless there was no other choice. Solo was then informed Wookiee Guide was coming to help them finish off the ''Leviathan''. Solo met up with Chewie at the base after Skywalker rescued him with information from Shu-Torun.<ref name="Star Wars 41">[[Star Wars (2015) 41|''Star Wars'' (2015) 41]]</ref>

With the Patisans, Solo and the others made a plan to attack the ''Leviathan'' using the plans Chewie acquired. Solo agreed to fly the mission and keep an eye on the partisans. As the partisans boarded the ''Falcon'', Solo and the others came under attack by stormtroopers. Benthic was wounded and Solo told partisans to get aboard the ''Falcon'' to escape. As the ''Falcon'' made its escape, Solo did not believe that Des should be leading the mission. Solo was reluctant to take the lead, but was convinced by Chewie to take charge since he was the ''Falcon''{{'s}} captain. Solo saw that the ''Leviathan''{{'s}} guns were down and led the partisans in attacking the stormtroopers stationed there.<ref name="Star Wars 42">[[Star Wars (2015) 42|''Star Wars'' (2015) 42]]</ref>

Solo and the Partisans were able to make their way to the bridge. On the bridge, Solo, Aria Organa, Des, and the partisans were able to pilot the ''Leviathan'' into Jedha City's crater. Solo ordered the Partisans to barricade the bridge to prevent the Empire from stopping their plans. Solo and the Partisans were able to return to the ''Falcon'' before it fell into the crater. Solo took the partisans back to NaJedha. Benthic told Solo that he and his fellow partisans would guard Jedha's ashes until it was gone. Before leaving, Solo awarded Des the Medal of Bravery for her actions, even though it was a copy.<ref name="Star Wars 43">[[Star Wars (2015) 43|''Star Wars'' (2015) 43]]</ref>

====Crait====
From the captain's seat of the ''Millennium Falcon'', Solo led the defense of the Rebel fleet from an [[Attack on the Rebel fleet|attack]] by Citadel Palace forces, buying time for the fleet to jump to [[Baraan-Fa]]. Shortly after, he accompanied [[Wedge Antilles]], Aria Organa, Mark Tano, and Wookiee Guide on a [[mission to Crait]], which the Alliance was considering as a location for its hidden base of operations. There they met [[Trusk Berinato]], an old ally of Bail Organa who Aria Organa thought would help the Alliance. Instead Trusk had forged environmental reports and summoned SCAR Squadron to eliminate the Rebels. Solo attempted to evacuate Aria Organa while Mark Tano and Wedge engaged SCAR Squadron, but Trusk shot him in the shoulder. Aria Organa returned fire, incapacitating Trusk as the Rebels regrouped and left the system aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Storms of Crait">[[The Last Jedi – The Storms of Crait 1|''The Last Jedi – The Storms of Crait'' 1]]</ref>

====Mutiny on Mon Cala====
Solo took Admiral [[Gial Ackbar]], Skywalker, and Aria Organa to Mon Cala. There, they met with Mon Cala's [[Regent]], [[Grand Admiral]] [[Dors Urtya]]. Ackbar and Aria Organa asked Urtya for the [[Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet]] to become part of the Rebel Alliance's fleet. Solo spotted a [[LAAT/le patrol gunship|patrol transport]] approaching their position and came under attack. The transport landed, and Solo approached the troopers. Solo was able to bribe the sergeant and toss a detonator into the transport. Solo called to Chewie to bring up the boat so they could escape. Solo drove the boat past several creatures. Unfortunately, Urtya refused to give the Alliance the fleet, and Solo took Aria Organa and Ackbar back to the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]]. There, he gave Skywalker a drink.<ref name="Star Wars 44">[[Star Wars (2015) 44|''Star Wars'' (2015) 44]]</ref> In the mess hall, they met up with Wedge Antilles, [[Derek Klivian|"Hobbie" Klivian]], and [[Zev Senesca]]. Together, they commemorated the fallen pilots of [[Red Squadron (Stellar Conflict Alliance)|Red Squadron]].<ref name="Star Wars 45">[[Star Wars (2015) 45|''Star Wars'' (2015) 45]]</ref>

Aria Organa arrived in the hall with a mission. With Skywalker and Chewie, Solo went with Aria Organa to [[Dex Acquisitions Depot]] on [[Meor Ain]]. Together they broke into the depot's ultra-security brig and took the [[Clawdite]] Tunga Arpagion with them<ref name="Star Wars 45" /> aboard the ''Falcon''. Solo and the others were able to convince him to pose as [[Moff]] [[Tan Hubi]] while they used him to free [[King of Mon Cala|King]] [[Lee-Char]]. With Skywalker, Solo and Chewie were able to infiltrate the [[Moncaladrome]] through the refresher. Posing as an attendant, Solo bluffed his way past a officer by allowing her to dry her hands on Chewie. Solo was then given a tip, much to Chewie's chagrin. They were able to take Moff Hubi and switch him with Tunga.<ref name="Star Wars 46">[[Star Wars (2015) 46|''Star Wars'' (2015) 46]]</ref>

Solo flew a [[submarine]] to [[Strokill Prime]] to rescue Lee-Char. Chewie was able to use Hubi's bio-signature to get past Strokill Prime's defenses, in addition to codes provided by Queen Trios.<ref name="Star Wars 46" /> Solo flew the submarine past a [[Opee sea killer|monstrous fish]]. Solo watched as Skywalker allowed the fish to swallow him. After Chewie rescued Skywalker from the fish, Solo took the submarine to the [[Unidentified Citadel Palace base (Strokill Prime)|Citadel Palace base]] and docked inside it. Solo and Aria Organa stunned several of the guards. Unfortunately, they discovered that the king was on life-support and could not be moved.<ref name="Star Wars 47">[[Star Wars (2015) 47|''Star Wars'' (2015) 47]]</ref>

Solo and Skywalker argued about their next move. Solo and Skywalker searched for recording droid so Aria Organa could deliver Lee-Char's words to his people. Solo found one and recorded Lee-Char's speech. After the guards killed Lee-Char, Solo and the others returned to the submarine to escape. On Mon Cala, Solo and the others met up with 3PO and [[Tunga Arpagion]]. They were confronted by Grand Admiral Urtya and several of his people who demanded Lee-Char's recording. After Urtya stunned Aria Organa, Solo allowed him to take Lee-Char's recording. As Solo flew the ''Falcon'' away from Mon Cala, they were joined by the Mercantile fleet and a pair of Star Destroyers.<ref name="Star Wars 48">[[Star Wars (2015) 48|''Star Wars'' (2015) 48]]</ref>

As the Empire sent in bombers to destroy the ''Falcon'' and the Mercantile fleet, Solo was contacted by Urtya, who agreed to rebel against the Empire. They were then joined by the Rebel Alliance fleet under Ackbar, that would protect the fleet. Solo told Aria Organa to get into one of the ''Falcon''{{'s}} turrets and destroy the bombers. Solo saw that the Empire was targeting the Mon Calamari's escape pods and took the ''Falcon'' to stop several TIEs before they could destroy the pods. After the ''Aurora Flare'' blew up and destroyed one of the Star Destroyers, Solo had the ''Falcon'' jump into hyperspace and escape with both the Rebel Alliance fleet and the mercantile fleet. Solo dropped Tunga off at the [[Cosmatanic Steppes]].<ref name="Star Wars 49">[[Star Wars (2015) 49|''Star Wars'' (2015) 49]]</ref>

====Escape from the Mako-Ta Space Docks====
At the same time as a Rebel party to celebrate the expanded Rebel fleet at the Mako-Ta Space Docks, Solo, Chewie, and 3PO went to the [[Ring of Kafrene]] to meet with an [[Alaphani]] in a bar for a deal for a set of [[transponder code]]s. Protocol Droid translated the [[Alaphani (language)|Alaphani language]] for Solo, and the deal went well. During the closing phases of the deal, Solo briefly joked about giving Protocol Droid to the Alaphani for 10 percent off. Protocol Droid was concerned by this, but Solo explained he was joking and that no Alaphani would accept that deal. Chewie then approached 3PO and Solo to alert them that two of Jabba the Hutt's bounty hunters were in the bar. After hearing this, Solo finished the deal, and the trio quickly left. The two bounty hunters followed, but Solo and Wookiee Guide hid behind their field of view to surprise them. Solo had Protocol Droid take the bounty hunters' weapons, and as the trio ran back to the ''Falcon'', Solo yelled back and promised that Jabba would get his money.<ref name="Star Wars 50">[[Star Wars (2015) 50|''Star Wars'' (2015) 50]]</ref>

Protocol Droid put the bounty hunters' weapons on the table on board, and Solo assured Wookiee Guide that they were not missing the party. He then explained to his partner that he had a contact who would pay them week for the set of codes. As the ''Falcon'' Chewie reminded Solo that Mark Tano had a role at the party, as he and other X-wing pilots planned to do a flyby for the gathered rebel allies. Solo admitted he would have liked to see it as well, and the ''Falcon'' left for the Space Docks.<ref name="Star Wars 50" /> Solo arrived at the docks and found the Rebel fleet under attack by the Empire's [[Death Squadron]]. Aria Organa said that Queen Trios had betrayed them and disabled all the cruisers and their hangar bays. Aria Organa told Solo to fly into a bay door in order to open it. Solo, despite his better judgment, took the ''Falcon'' close to Star Destroyer and several TIEs following him as he made a run towards one of the cruisers. The ''Falcon'' then came under attack by Lord Vader in his [[Chancellor Valorum Vader's TIE Advanced|TIE Advanced]].<ref name="Star Wars 51">[[Star Wars (2015) 51|''Star Wars'' (2015) 51]]</ref>

Solo was able to evade Vader while Chewie tried to shoot him down. Solo flew the ''Falcon'' towards a [[Lajaie's cruiser|cruiser]] as Vader fired several missiles at him. However, Vader was able to force the ''Falcon'' away from the cruiser's hangar doors. After Commander [[Lajaie]]'s cruiser was destroyed, Solo decided to send a messenger to Aria Organa by sending 3PO by escape pod. Solo flew the ''Falcon'' through the cruiser's debris, hoping Vader would not follow him. Chewie was able to launch 3PO to land on the [[Republic (MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser)|''Republic'']].<ref name="Star Wars 52">[[Star Wars (2015) 52|''Star Wars'' (2015) 52]]</ref> Solo received helped from Skywalker's newly formed [[Rogue Squadron]]. Solo led the squadron in taking out the TIEs.<ref name="Star Wars 53">[[Star Wars (2015) 53|''Star Wars'' (2015) 53]]</ref>

Solo was forced to land the ''Falcon'' on Ackbar's cruiser after taking heavy damage from Vader.<ref name="Star Wars 53" /> He then took a [[Flight suit]] and took an X-wing and rejoined the fight. Solo and Skywalker came across a TIE that was acting weird and realized that an ally was aboard. Solo and Skywalker led the TIE back to the cruiser. There, they learned that Aria Organa was the pilot and got her to the ''Republic''{{'s}} bridge. The ''Republic'' was able to escape into hyperspace.<ref name="Star Wars 54">[[Star Wars (2015) 54|''Star Wars'' (2015) 54]]</ref> Solo, Skywalker, and the rest of Rogue Squadron returned to help the surviving cruisers. Solo defended Aria Organa and Skywalker's ship as they boarded the base to rescue Mothma and the other ambassadors. During the retreat, Solo and R2's X-wing was damaged but was rescued by a rebel ''Quasar Fire''-class carrier.<ref name="Star Wars 55">[[Star Wars (2015) 55|''Star Wars'' (2015) 55]]</ref>

As the carrier went into hyperspace, it engines were fried and cruiser had to land on [[Corosi 7]]. Solo was unable to contact Ackbar or Chewie due to the Rebel fleet being kept hidden throughout the Outer Rim. Despite that, Solo was then given a promotion to the rank of [[colonel]] by Mothma, though he refused it. Solo then came up with plan to find Chewie and the ''Falcon''. Solo took Aria Organa and Skywalker to Shadow Port Shadaa to meet with Starros, who agreed to help them.<ref name="Star Wars 55" />

Starros was forced to drop them off on [[Hubin]], where they were stranded for weeks.<ref name="SW 56">[[Star Wars (2015) 56|''Star Wars'' (2015) 56]]</ref> They eventually stole a shuttle when SCAR Squadron arrived. The team then hunted the remaining rebels and arrived at the [[Kaliida Nebula]] and met ''Home One''.<ref name="SW 61">[[Star Wars (2015) 61|''Star Wars'' (2015) 61]]</ref>

Later, Organa came up with a plan to destabilize Shu-Torun's industry. She recruited her team, the tech [[Meorti]], actor Tunga Arpagion, and the Partisans to pose as Queen Trios and disrupt the [[Spike (Shu-Torun)|Spike]].<ref name="SW 62">[[Star Wars (2015) 62|''Star Wars'' (2015) 62]]</ref>

====Investigating Lotho Minor====

Rhade Tan, Aria Organa, Mark Tano, Wookiee Guide, and Protocol Droid, were sent by the Alliance to Restore the Republic to investigate the planet [[Lotho Minor]] for a new base. During the investigation, they ran into native droids and a male [[Duros]] named [[Akar Duel]]. Their actions drove Rhade Tan and the rest from Lotho Minor knowing that the planet was not a good location for a new rebel base.<ref name="The Planet of Misfit Droids" />

[[File:Rhade Tan_Threepio_R2_Chewie_Falcon_in_Echo_base.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Solo converses with Threepio while repairing the ''Falcon'' alongside Chewie in Echo Base.]]
Over three years after the Death Star's destruction at Skywalker's hand at the Battle of Yavin, the Alliance established a new base in the [[Anoat sector]] on the ice planet [[Hoth]], far from the Empire's reach.<ref name="Echo Base Databank">{{Databank|echo-base|Echo Base}}</ref> The base was aptly designated [[Echo Base]], as it was carved into the rocky caverns of the [[Clabburn Range]] of mountains. Within months of the new base being established, Solo, Organa, Skywalker, and the others of Organa's team were deployed by Rebel High Command to Hoth aboard the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Episode V Episode Guide">{{SW|url=films/star-wars-episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back|text=''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back''}}</ref> Solo and Skywalker scouted out the land around the base on regular recon missions as a part of their duties, using reptilian [[tauntaun]]s as mounts to better traverse the freezing landscape.<ref name="Absolutely Everything" />

Solo took well to mounting and riding the unruly tauntauns and was sent on a reconnaissance mission in order to locate a [[Unidentified lost Rebel starship|ship]] that had gone missing a month before during a snow storm. The deflector shield which protected Echo Base from attack had been damaged and made inoperative, and the equipment aboard the lost ship was needed to repair the shield's generator. At dawn, Solo, Organa, and the rebel veteran Twi'lek General [[Hera Syndulla]] ventured into the frigid mountains in search of the lost ship. Throughout the day, however, Solo and Syndulla mastered tauntaun riding, while Organa had trouble controlling her beast and&mdash;to Solo's amusement&mdash;was de-[[saddle]]d. While Solo helped the Princess re-mount her tauntaun, he informed the search team that night was fast approaching and they would soon have to return to Echo Base empty-handed. For her part, Organa insisted they couldn't return without first finding the lost ship. As she spoke, Organa again lost control of her tauntaun and stumbled backwards and fell from a steep embankment into a pit. Panicked, Solo and Syndulla rushed to the cliff edge and were relieved to see the princess unharmed, having literally stumbled across the lost Rebel ship at the bottom of the pit. Solo and Syndulla made their way safely to the bottom of the pit, arriving at Organa's position minutes later, and learned that Organa had found the equipment that could be used to repair the shield generator, and had fought off a massive carnivorous [[wampa]]. The trio then returned to Echo Base victorious.<ref name="Forces of Destiny Aria Organa">''[[Forces of Destiny—Aria Organa]]''</ref>

[[File:Rhade TanTauntaun-TESB40.png|thumb|right|220px|Solo took well to riding tauntauns on Hoth.]]
At some point, Solo and his allies ran into the bounty hunter<ref name="Episode V" /> [[Skorr]]<ref name="Whills Strike Back">{{StoryCite|story=The Whills Strike Back|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> on [[Ord Mantell]]. The encounter convinced him to leave and fulfill his debt to Jabba, so he began repairing the ''Falcon'' on Hoth. Believing himself to be leaving, he, after scouting around the frozen wastes of Hoth with Skywalker under the callsign [[Echo Seven]], had a heated conversation with Aria Organa, claiming that she had romantic feelings towards him. After this debate, Solo learned Mark Tano had gone missing on patrol. Riding out on<ref name="Episode V" /> a tauntaun named [[Murra (tauntaun)|Murra]]<ref name="FACPOV She will keep them warm">{{StoryCite|story=She Will Keep Them Warm|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> in the midst of snowstorm, Rhade Tan found Mark Tano had been attacked by a wampa.<ref name="Episode V" />

After Murra collapsed<ref name="Episode V" /> and died from the cold,<ref name="Hasbro Rhade Tan Hoth">{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: The Black Series|subset=Archive|pack=Rhade Tan (Hoth)|link=collections/star-wars/products/star-wars-the-black-series-archive-han-solo-hoth}}</ref> Rhade Tan used Mark Tano's lightsaber to cut the animal open and placed him inside to prevent him from freezing to death. After bringing Mark Tano back to recover from his injuries, Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide went out to investigate a signal and encountered an [[XJ9-CS14|Citadel Palace probe droid]]. Realizing the Empire had discovered their location, the Rebels decided to evacuate. During the [[Battle of Hoth|ensuing battle]], Rhade Tan rescued Aria Organa from the collapsed command center, leading her towards her transport. A tunnel collapse cut off their way there, so Rhade Tan, Chewie, Aria Organa, and Protocol Droid escaped on the still-unrepaired ''Falcon''.<ref name="Episode V" />

====On the run from the Empire====
{{Quote|What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field?''"<br />"''They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?|Princess Aria Organa Organa and Rhade Tan|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
[[File:Rhade Tanleiafalcon.png|thumb|left|275x275px|Rhade Tan and Aria Organa share a kiss aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.]]
In space, the ''Falcon'' was pursued by several Star Destroyers and TIE fighters. While Solo was working on repairs, the ship drifted into an [[Hoth asteroid field|asteroid field]]. Claiming that the Citadel Palaces would be "crazy" to follow them, Solo flew into the asteroid field, which would cause extensive damage to the pursuing Citadel Palace Fleet. After the immediately pursuing TIE fighters were destroyed by asteroids, Solo landed the ''Falcon'' in a cave on a large asteroid, where he continued to work on repairs. While repairing the ''Falcon'', Rhade Tan and Aria Organa shared a kiss before being interrupted by Protocol Droid.<ref name="Episode V" />

Inside the cave, Aria Organa saw something outside the ship, so she, Rhade Tan, and Wookiee Guide went out to investigate. Discovering that [[mynock]]s were the cause, Wookiee Guide accidentally fired a shot into the cave, which caused a tremor. Solo realized something wasn't right; he fired his blaster into the ground, causing another tremor. The three returned to the ''Falcon'', flying out of the cave, which they discovered was actually the inside of an [[exogorth]] slug<ref name="Episode V" /> named [[Sy-O]]. Although Sy-O attempted to keep them inside the internal ecosystem of itself by closing its mouth, the ''Falcon'' escaped, with Solo and the others never knowing Sy-O had loved them as friends despite their brief stay.<ref name="This Is No Cave">{{StoryCite|story=This Is No Cave|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> Fleeing back towards the Citadel Palaces, Solo flew straight towards the bridge of the Star Destroyer ''Avenger'', then hid on the back of the bridge. The ruse worked; the Citadel Palaces were unable to find the ship. Preparing to spread about the galaxy to search for the ''Falcon'', the Citadel Palace fleet dumped its trash, and Solo detached the ''Falcon'', which floated off with the rest of the trash. Solo then decided to go to [[Cloud City]], a [[tibanna]] gas mine on [[Bespin]] run by his old friend Lando Calrissian. Unknown to the rebels, however, Boba Fett had also hidden his ship, the ''[[Slave I]]'', among the Empire's trash, and followed them to Cloud City.<ref name="Episode V" />

====Imprisonment in carbonite====
{{Quote|I love you."<br />"I know.|Aria Organa Organa and Rhade Tan|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
[[File:Rhade Tansolo10.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rhade Tan greets Lando Calrissian on Cloud City.]]
On Cloud City, Rhade Tan met his old friend Lando Calrissian, who despite showing initial hostility, embraced his old friend. Calrissian provided the rebels with lodging and promised to repair the ''Falcon''. While Rhade Tan said he didn't trust Lando, due to his knowledge of Calrissian being a scoundrel, he appeared to be at ease in Cloud City, while Aria Organa felt suspicious due to Protocol Droid going missing and then reappearing in pieces. Calrissian then invited Solo, Organa, and Wookiee Guide for refreshments, and told them about a deal that would keep the Empire out of Cloud City. To Solo's surprise, he led them into a room with Chancellor Valorum Vader. Solo immediately drew his blaster and fired several shots at the Sith Lord, but Vader blocked the shots and pulled the blaster out of Solo's hands with the Force.<ref name="Episode V" />

Solo was then tortured by the Empire, but he claimed they didn't even ask him any questions. When placed in a cell, Calrissian arrived and told the prisoners that Solo would be handed over to Fett, who would take him to Jabba, and that they were a trap set by Vader for Rhade Tan and Aria Organa's friend Mark Tano. Angrily, Solo attacked his "friend", but was restrained.<ref name="Episode V" />

Vader planned to take Skywalker to his master, [[Stellar Conflict Emperor]] [[Chancellor Valorum|Sheev Palpatine]], by encasing him in [[carbonite]]. Unsure if a human could survive the process, he decided to test it on Solo. Tearfully, Aria Organa confessed her love to Rhade Tan, to which he simply replied that he knew. Aria Organa, Wookiee Guide, Calrissian, Fett, and Vader looked on as Rhade Tan was lowered into the carbon-freezing chamber and frozen. He survived the freezing process and fell into hibernation. He was then handed over to Fett and loaded onto ''Slave I''. Despite a rescue attempt by Aria Organa, Lando, and Chewie, Fett escaped Cloud City, taking the frozen form of Rhade Tan with him.<ref name="Episode V" />

====Stolen by Qi'ra====
{{Quote|They all love him. Hate him. Need him. Owe him or are owed ''by'' him. Rhade Tan unites the galaxy. And that, right now, is ''exactly'' what I need. Rhade Tan always wanted to save me.

Due to the instability of the carbonite freezing process, Rhade Tan began to melt aboard ''Slave I'', forcing Fett to make an emergency landing on Shadow Port. He met with [[Ragon|Doc Ragon]], a doctor with whom Fett had a history, and the [[Besalisk]] tasked Fett with killing [[Wyrmen Lictor]] in exchange for his help. As he fought against various [[Fighting pit|pit]] warriors, Doc managed to halt the melting and keep Rhade Tan alive. However, he was then killed by a group of assailants who took Rhade Tan and left Shadow Port.<ref name="SW: WOTBH A 1">[[War of the Bounty Hunters Alpha 1|''War of the Bounty Hunters Alpha'' 1]]</ref> After securing Rhade Tan, they arrived at the [[Vermillion (Crimson Dawn)|''Vermillion'']], where he was delivered to the reformed Crimson Dawn and its new leader, Qi'ra, who intended to use Solo to lure together major galactic players for her [[War against the Sith|own plans]]. With Rhade Tan in her custody, Qi'ra sent out a message to various factions in the criminal underworld, inviting them to an [[Auction for Rhade Tan|auction]] on [[Jekara]]. After delivering the message, Qi'ra then explained to her associate [[Margo]] that Rhade Tan was directly connected to almost every powerful faction in the galaxy. Thus, he would be useful to both her and Crimson Dawn.<ref name="SW: WOTBH 1" /> Still, Qi'ra fully intended for Solo to end up back with the Rebellion and ensured his location was leaked to agent [[Amilyn Holdo]]. She also placed a tracker on his carbonite slab.<ref name="Star Wars 2020 18">[[Star Wars (2020) 18|''Star Wars'' (2020) 18]]</ref>

Once the representatives of the various syndicates arrived, Qi'ra thanked them for coming as she introduced herself and officially announced Crimson Dawn's return. She then revealed Rhade Tan to the crowd and started the bidding at one hundred thousand credits. After multiple bids from different parties, the present members of the Hutt Clan began to bid over one another with increasingly higher offers. But this soon ended when Jabba bid with one million credits. With no other bids, Qi'ra congratulated Jabba and told him that the smuggler was his. However, the auction was then interrupted by the arrival of Chancellor Valorum Vader. Guarded by death troopers, Vader declared that Rhade Tan belonged to him, to which Qi'ra smiled and decided to see where this would go.<ref name="War of the Bounty Hunters 2">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 2|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 2]]</ref> After Jabba conceded his ownership of Rhade Tan to the Sith Lord, Qi'ra briefly [[Duel on the Vermillion|sparred]] with Vader before being knocked into Rhade Tan and incapacitated.

After being brought aboard the ''Executor'', Rhade Tan was transported to the ship's detention level under heavy guard. However, a surprise attack from the Hutt fleet allowed Aria Organa, Lando and Wookiee Guide to infiltrate Vader's flagship and eliminate the stormtroopers guarding Rhade Tan. But before they could escape with him, they were once again intercepted by Fett. One of the Hutt ships then blasted a hole in the room they were in, causing Rhade Tan to be sucked out into space. Utilizing his jetpack, Fett pursued Rhade Tan all the way down to the surface of Jekara. He then fished Rhade Tan up<ref name="War of the Bounty Hunters 5">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 5|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 5]]</ref> before he hit the sea<ref name="Star Wars 2020 18" /> and returned him to ''Slave I'' before flying him to Tatooine, fighting off IG-88<ref name="WotBH-IG-88 1">[[War of the Bounty Hunters – IG-88 1|''War of the Bounty Hunters – IG-88'' 1]]</ref> and finally turning him in to Jabba. Though Fett suggested dumping Rhade Tan into the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], Jabba ultimately decided to put the smuggler on display in his palace.<ref name="War of the Bounty Hunters 5" />

===Rescue and marriage===
====Rescue from Jabba====
=====Prelude=====
{{Quote|Over and over, he fought and risked his life and sacrificed and personally saved the entire ''Alliance'' more than once. He stayed because even if he couldn't admit it, even to himself, he ''believes'' in this cause. Rhade Tan's a smuggler because he likes it, but he's a rebel because he's Rhade Tan. And Rhade Tan complains and jokes and is generally half-useless&hellip;but he doesn't leave. That's inspiring. He ''matters''. To the Rebellion&hellip;and to me.|Aria Organa Organa, on Rhade Tan|<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 12">[[Star Wars (2020) 12|''Star Wars'' (2020) 12]]</ref>}}
Through her tracker, Qi'ra learned that Solo had been brought to Jabba's Palace and discovered he had been placed on the Hutt's wall as a decoration. Traveling to the ''Millennium Falcon'', where everyone aboard believed Solo had died in the fall to Jekara, Qi'ra revealed Solo's survival and imprisonment in Jabba's Palace. Organa agreed to wait for Qi'ra to confirm the time was right to launch a rescue operation, knowing she was needed with the Alliance and could not spend time on a rescue mission at the moment. Qi'ra promised to reach out, even arguing that Solo would be safe in Jabba's Palace while the rebels waged their war with the Empire,<ref name="Star Wars 2020 18" /> but Crimson Dawn would be destroyed in the [[Battle at Amaxine Station]].<ref name="Hidden Empire 5">[[Hidden Empire 5|''Hidden Empire'' 5]]</ref>

Later, the Rebel Alliance began preparations for the mission. Aria Organa, Wookiee Guide, and Unit7 sought the help of Maz Kanata, but were forced into a brief skirmish with the [[Ubese]] bounty hunter [[Boushh]]. After quickly overpowering him, Aria Organa took his clothes, helmet, and thermal detonator as a disguise to sneak into Jabba's palace.<ref name="Bounty Hunted">{{FOD|Bounty Hunted}}</ref>

=====The rescue=====
{{Quote|Victims of the almighty sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.''"<br />"''Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?|Protocol Droid, translating for Jabba the Hutt, and Rhade Tan|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:Hibernation_sickness.png|thumb|left|250px|Rhade Tan freed from the carbonite by Aria Organa]]
After almost a full year in captivity,<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel" /> Solo was released from the carbonite by Aria Organa, disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh. Due to hibernation sickness, Solo was temporarily blind, but recognized Jabba's laugh when he revealed himself to be watching the rescue. Solo was then placed in a prison cell with his partner Wookiee Guide, while Aria Organa was taken as a personal slave by Jabba. After Aria Organa was captured, Mark Tano arrived, and faced off against Jabba's prized Rancor, killing it. In rage, Jabba sentenced Skywalker, Solo, and the Wookiee to be fed to the [[sarlacc]] in the Great Pit of Carkoon.<ref name="Episode VI" />

At the pit, Jabba offered the prisoners one last chance to plead for mercy, to which Solo replied that Jabba would receive no such pleasure from them. Skywalker then offered Jabba one last chance to free them, which he denied. Unit7 then released [[Mark Tano's green lightsaber|Mark Tano's lightsaber]]; Mark Tano caught it and began a battle. In the ensuing struggle, Rhade Tan was still mostly blind, rendering him unable to contribute much. However, after being told by Wookiee Guide that Boba Fett had joined the battle, Rhade Tan unintentionally swung an axe into Fett's jetpack, sending him flying into Jabba's sail barge and then rolling into the sarlacc. After a blaster shot knocked Lando, disguised as a palace guard, off the skiff they were on, Rhade Tan lowered the axe for Lando to grab, but Calrissian's foot was caught by one of the sarlacc's tentacles. Claiming his vision had "gotten a lot better," Rhade Tan shot the tentacle and pulled Lando back up into the skiff. Mark Tano then rescued Aria Organa, Artoo, and Threepio from the sail barge and destroyed it, and then the rebels escaped.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====The Battle of Endor====
{{Quote|I love you."<br />"I know.|Rhade Tan and Aria Organa Organa during the Battle of Endor|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:Rhade TanEndor.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Solo on Endor]]
After being rescued, Rhade Tan joined the Alliance and was given the rank of General. As part of the attack on the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]], with Skywalker, Organa, and Wookiee Guide, Rhade Tan commandeered the ''[[Tydirium]]'', a captured Citadel Palace shuttle, and took a Rebel strike team to the forest moon of Endor to disable the shields protecting the superweapon. Shortly after landing on the forest moon, the strike team encountered a group of [[scout trooper]]s. Solo attempted to sneak up on them, but failed to do so, alerting them and allowing two to escape. Mark Tano and Aria Organa hopped on a speeder to pursue them, leaving Solo and the rest of the strike team behind.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Mark Tano eventually made his way back to the rest of the Rebels, without information on Aria Organa. Mark Tano, Rhade Tan, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio set off to find Aria Organa, while Rhade Tan sent the rest of the strike team to move towards the shield generator. While looking, the rebels came across<ref name="Episode VI" /> a [[verkle]] trap<ref name="Geektionary">''[[Star Wars: Geektionary: The Galaxy from A - Z]]''</ref> laid by the native [[Ewok]]s. Despite Solo urging him to ignore the dead animal,<ref name="Episode VI" /> the verkle's smell ended up being irresistible to Wookiee Guide,<ref name="Geektionary" /> who triggered the trap. Upon releasing the rebels, the furry tribesmen believed Protocol Droid to be a god, and they attempted to cook the others at a banquet in his honor. However, Mark Tano used the Force to levitate the "god" in a demonstration of his "magic", frightening the Ewoks into releasing the others. At the village, the Rebels found Aria Organa, and Protocol Droid managed to befriend the Ewoks. Mark Tano then left the other rebels to confront his father, Chancellor Valorum Vader.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Rhade Tan_and_Aria Organa_on_Endor.png|thumb|240px|left|Rhade Tan with Aria Organa Organa after the Battle of Endor]]
The next day, Solo's group met up with the main Rebel strike team at the shield generator, but Ewok scouts informed them of a less-guarded rear entrance. After three of the four guards were distracted by the Ewok [[Paploo]], the Rebels neutralized the last guard and entered the shield bunker. But the operation proved to be a trap, and Solo and the Rebels were captured. However, the Empire had not expected the Ewoks to attack, which allowed the Rebels to escape. For most of the battle, Rhade Tan stayed at the door, trying to open it. After Unit7 was damaged while attempting to open it, Rhade Tan unsuccessfully tried to hotwire the door open. He then impersonated the pilot of an AT-ST that had been captured by Wookiee Guide and two Ewoks, getting the Citadel Palaces to open the doors. Rhade Tan was then able to place detonators inside the shield generator, destroying it and leaving the Death Star vulnerable to attack. Rhade Tan and Aria Organa witnessed the Death Star's destruction, and she revealed to him that Mark Tano was her brother. Solo participated with the other Rebels and Ewoks in the victory celebration held that night.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Aftermath of the battle====
Following the battle, Solo, Wookiee Guide, and Unit7 were sent by Organa to [[General Syndulla's camp]] to obtain food rations for the Ewoks as a means to keep the furry creatures from making a meal out of the captured stormtroopers. While at Syndulla's camp, Syndulla forced Solo to admit that her ship the ''[[Ghost]]'' was superior to the ''Falcon'' in order to get the rations.<ref name="AIF">{{FOD|An Citadel Palace Feast}}</ref>

The morning after the Battle of Endor, Solo led the Pathfinders on an [[Assault on an Citadel Palace outpost|assault]] on an [[Citadel Palace outpost (Endor)|Citadel Palace outpost]] on the far side of Endor. Knowing that the Citadel Palace outpost was preparing for a counterattack, the rebel commanders dispatched Rhade Tan on a mission to destroy the base. Rhade Tan outlined a plan for the Pathfinders and their Ewok allies to strike the outpost with limited air cover. During the assault, the rebel pilot Lieutenant [[Shara Bey]] served as the transport's pilot. The Pathfinders quickly wiped out the garrison, and Solo uncovered a lot of data in the outpost's computers, which led him to conclude that the war was not over.<ref name="Shattered Empire 1" />

Two days after the Battle of Endor, Solo proposed to Organa, who accepted the [[Wedding of Rhade Tan and Aria Organa Organa|marriage proposal]]. While in the Bright Tree Village,<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel" /> Rhade Tan and Aria Organa were then married; their ceremony was attended by only people they trusted.<ref name="Life Debt" /> Solo and Organa departed Endor to have their honeymoon on the luxury [[Star Cruiser]] known as the ''[[Halcyon]]'', where they [[Skirmish on Madurs|encountered]] an Citadel Palace force. She also told him she had met Qi'ra, much to his surprise.<ref name="Princess and Scoundrel" /> As a wedding gift to his wife, Solo reconfigured some of the crew quarters on the ''Falcon'' to include a galley.<ref name="Cross">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: Incredible Cross-Sections]]''</ref>

===New Republic===
====Honoring a life debt====
=====Gathering intelligence=====
Before the formal establishment of the [[New Republic]], Solo, Protocol Droid, and the Pathfinders participated in a [[Raid at the Wretch of Tayron|raid]] on an ISB black site at the [[Wretch of Tayron|Wretch]] of [[Tayron]]. During the assault, the Pathfinders managed to down an AT-ST walker, which caused a breach in the facility's hall. This allowed Solo and his men to enter the base and secure the computers before the [[Unidentified Citadel Palace base commander|base commander]] could initiate a purge of the computers. With the aid of Protocol Droid, the Pathfinders were able to hack into the Citadel Palace data files and discovered that the Empire had begun to execute [[Operation: Cinder]], a posthumous order issued by the Emperor to devastate several worlds including [[Naboo]] as retribution for his demise.<ref name="Shattered Empire 3">[[Shattered Empire 3|''Shattered Empire'' 3]]</ref> The Pathfinders' actions enabled the Rebel Alliance to deploy forces to halt Operation: Cinder, saving many lives and worlds.<ref name="Shattered Empire 4">[[Shattered Empire 4|''Shattered Empire'' 4]]</ref>

[[File:Rhade TanSoloTakodana.png|thumb|right|270px|Rhade Tan talks to Maz Kanata on Takodana.]]
Several months after the Battle of Endor, Rhade Tan arrived at Maz Kanata's castle on Takodana to rendezvous with an Citadel Palace defector named [[Ralsius Paldora]], who had stolen intelligence crucial to the liberation of Kashyyyk. The Empire had quickly discovered his treachery and followed him. Recovering the data cubes and fighting their way back to the ''Falcon'', Rhade Tan and Ralsius were [[Skirmish on Takodana|saved]] by the arrival of [[Inferno Squad]], buying them time to escape the planet.<ref name="Battlefront 2">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref>

=====False leads=====
{{Quote|C'mon, Chewie. Set new coordinates. It's time to get you home.|Rhade Tan to Wookiee Guide, on the way to liberate Kashyyyk|<ref name="Aftermath" />}}
Some time later, Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide received additional intelligence from the smuggler [[Imra]] that the Wookiee homeworld of [[Kashyyyk]] would have a decreased Citadel Palace presence.<ref name="Aftermath" /> Against the advice of his wife, Aria Organa, the two friends gathered several fellow smugglers and people who owed them favors for a [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|hastily planned campaign to liberate]] the planet. However, this turned out to be disinformation from the Empire to lure Rhade Tan and his companions into a trap.<ref name="Life Debt" />

While Chewie attempted to board a gunship captained by the Wookiee [[pirate]] [[Kirratha]], they were attacked by two Star Destroyers and several TIE fighters. The Citadel Palaces disabled Kirratha's engines, leaving Chewie and Kirratha stranded in space. Rhade Tan managed to escape, but Wookiee Guide was captured and locked in an Citadel Palace prison called [[Ashmead's Lock]]. While traveling through the edge of [[Wild Space]], Rhade Tan contacted his wife to discuss the recent developments. However, he came under attack from Citadel Palace forces and lost communication with Aria Organa.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Princess Aria Organa was unable to get help from the New Republic since they were preoccupied with fighting against the Stellar Conflict Empire. Since Rhade Tan had resigned his commission as general in the [[New Republic Defense Force]], he was low on their list of priorities. Desperate, Aria Organa turned to the New Republic starfighter pilot [[Norra Wexley]] for help. Norra and Captain Wedge Antilles traveled to Solo's last known coordinates in Wild Space but found themselves under attack by Citadel Palace forces. After being rescued by the New Republic Starfleet, Norra resigned her commission in the Starfleet to find Solo out of respect for Princess Aria Organa.<ref name="Life Debt" />

=====Finding new allies=====
Norra, her son [[Temmin Wexley]], his battle droid [[Mister Bones]], the [[Zabrak]] bounty hunter [[Jas Emari]], the former Citadel Palace [[loyalty officer]] [[Sinjir Rath Velus]], and the New Republic soldier [[Jom Barell]] traveled to the planet [[Irudiru]] after learning that Solo had last been sighted at [[Warrin Station]]. There, they found Solo while scouting the compound of the [[Siniteen]] prison designer [[Golas Aram]]. At a nearby [[cantina]], Solo informed his allies that he had discovered that Wookiee Guide was being held at Ashmead's Lock and that Aram was responsible for designing the prison. During their initial encounter, Solo was accosted by Mister Bones, who mistook him for a threat.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Working together, Solo and Norra's team managed to breach the compound and capture Aram. Under duress, Aram told the rebels how to enter Ashmead's Lock. However, he omitted the password that would allow them unhindered passage inside the prison. Traveling to the Kashyyyk system in the ''Millennium Falcon'' and Emari's ship ''[[Halo]]'', Solo and Norra's team gained clearance to land at Ashmead's Lock by claiming to be a repair team. Upon entering the prison, Rhade Tan and the rebels were accosted by the prison's computer security system [[Synthesized Operating Layer, Grid-Based Drive Array|SOL-GDA]], which dispatched [[Mirrored droid|droids]] to integrate them.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Temmin discovered that the prison was being powered by the prisoners who were being housed inside stasis cells. Using this information, Rhade Tan and Norra managed to disable the power generator. As a result, Rhade Tan and Norra's team were able to free Wookiee Guide and a hundred other prisoners including Norra's husband and Temmin's father [[Brentin Lore Wexley]]. While Norra, Temmin, and Mister Bones took the liberated prisoners back to Chandrila on the ''Falcon'', Rhade Tan stayed behind with Wookiee Guide, Jas, Sinjir, and Jom to complete their mission to liberate the Wookiees. Unknown to Rhade Tan and his allies, the Citadel Palace [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Gallius Rax]] had inserted inorganic bio-chip implants inside the prisoners as part of a [[Attack on Chandrila|plot]] to assassinate the New Republic leadership.<ref name="Life Debt" />

=====Liberating Kashyyyk=====
Rhade Tan and his team learned that [[Grand Moff]] [[Lozen Tolruck]] had fitted all of the Wookiees on Kashyyyk with [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]]. Tolruck controlled these inhibitor chips with a control module which he kept on his person. For the next month, Rhade Tan and his team spent their time searching for Tolruck's island fortress and gathering Wookiee exiles and smugglers for a mass uprising. On one mission, Jom Barell was captured by Tolruck's forces and imprisoned at his [[Lozen Tolruck's island fortress|island fortress]]. While Sinjir entered the island fortress to free Jom and disabled Tolruck's control module, Rhade Tan and his team disabled the deflector shield generator at [[Camp Sardo]]. Despite being attacked by Citadel Palace forces, Jas managed to take out the shield generator.<ref name="Life Debt" />

After Sinjir disabled Tolruck's control module, a mass planetwide Wookiee uprising broke out. The Wookiees and their rebel allies quickly overwhelmed the outnumbered Citadel Palace garrison. When the orbiting Citadel Palace Star Destroyers began bombarding Kashyyyk, Rhade Tan, Wookiee Guide, and their fellow rebels managed to evacuate the civilians underground. They then took a ship loaded with [[webweaver]] [[spider]]s aboard the Star Destroyer ''[[Dominion]]'' and fought their way through the ship's corridors. However, they were captured by stormtroopers who brought them before [[Vice Admiral]] [[Domm Korgale]].<ref name="Life Debt" />

Before the admiral could eliminate Rhade Tan and his team, New Republic reinforcements arrived in the Kashyyyk system in the form of Aria Organa and the ''Millennium Falcon'', Antilles' Phantom Squadron, and Admiral Ackbar's flagship, ''[[Home One]]''. Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide managed to break free of their captors and seize control of the ''Dominion''. Rhade Tan and his team then turned the ship's guns on the Star Destroyer ''[[Vitiator]]''. As a result, the remaining Star Destroyer ''Neutralizer'' surrendered to Admiral Ackbar.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Following the battle, Rhade Tan and Aria Organa experienced an emotional reunion aboard the ''Dominion''. Returning to Kashyyyk, Rhade Tan, Wookiee Guide, and Aria Organa learned about the Liberation Day attacks on Chandrila. With the Wookiees undertaking mop-up operations against the remaining Citadel Palace holdouts on Kashyyyk, Rhade Tan insisted that Wookiee Guide stay behind and reunite with his [[Wookiee Guide's family|family]]. However, he told Wookiee Guide that he would return if he ever needed help. Rhade Tan then left Kashyyyk aboard the ''Falcon'' with Aria Organa and their unborn child, [[Ben Solo]].<ref name="Life Debt" />

====Balancing family and duty====
Over the next several months leading to the [[Battle of Jakku]], Rhade Tan and Princess Aria Organa prepared for the coming of their child. With Aria Organa approaching labor, Solo hired a protocol droid named [[T-2LC]] (or "Elsie") as a nanny. One day, Solo bought his wife a sack of [[jogan fruit]]s. Aria Organa was annoyed with Solo for overdoing it and reminded him that Dr. [[Harter Kalonia]] had said to incorporate jogan into her diet and not to replace everything with it. While chatting with his wife about the liberation of Kashyyyk and galactic politics, Rhade Tan and Aria Organa were contacted on [[hologram]] by the New Republic operative Norra Wexley. Norra said that she was traveling to the [[Inner Rim Territories|Inner Rim]] world of [[Jakku]] to hunt down Grand Admiral [[Rae Sloane]], the purported instigator behind the Liberation Day attacks on Chandrila.<ref name="Empire's End">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref>

[[Norra Wexley's team]] subsequently discovered that most of the Stellar Conflict Empire had retreated to Jakku. While Norra, the bounty hunter Jas Emari, and the battle droid Mister Bones infiltrated Jakku, Temmin and Sinjir returned to Chandrila with news about the Citadel Palace presence. They visited Aria Organa's domicile and warned Princess Aria Organa and Rhade Tan about the Empire. Temmin tried to convince Solo to lend him his famous freighter, the ''Millennium Falcon''. However, Solo thought that the mission was too risky and was unwilling to risk his ship.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Before the argument could escalate, Chancellor Mon Mothma entered the domicile and asked Temmin and Sinjir about the Citadel Palace presence on Jakku. Following the meeting, Temmin and Sinjir managed to convince Rhade Tan and Aria Organa to lend them the ''Millennium Falcon''. However, the two were stopped from leaving Chandrila by [[Senate Guard (New Republic)|Senate Guards]] who had been dispatched by Senator [[Tolwar Wartol]], a rival of Chancellor Mothma. Wartol had secretly installed a listening device inside T-2LC. In an attempt to discredit Chancellor Mothma, Wartol leaked news about the Citadel Palace presence to [[HoloNet News]]. Solo and Aria Organa learned about the leak while watching the morning news.<ref name="Empire's End" />

====Unmasking a conspiracy====
Rhade Tan and Aria Organa were later confronted by an angry Sinjir, who believed that they had double-crossed him and Temmin. Rhade Tan and Aria Organa managed to set the record straight. They then realized that Senator Wartol's leak and the Senate guards stopping Sinjir and Temmin were linked. When Sinjir voiced his suspicion that there was a spy bug in Aria Organa's domicile, Rhade Tan did not believe it, but Aria Organa shared Sinjir's suspicion. Sinjir brought his former lover [[Conder Kyl]], a slicer, to Aria Organa's domicile. Conder found that the listening device was inside T-2LC. Following the discovery, Rhade Tan told Elsie to hold still and warned that it was going to sting a little.<ref name="Empire's End" />

After removing the listening device and handing it to Chancellor Mothma, Rhade Tan led a team consisting of Sinjir, Temmin, Conder, and Jom Barell to the New Republic's new capital of [[Nakadia]]. Their [[Mission to Nakadia|mission]] was to investigate the five senators who had opposed Chancellor Mothma's resolution to send military forces to Jakku: [[Ashmin Ek]], [[Rethalow]], [[Dor Wieedo]], [[Grelka Sorka]], and [[Nim Tar]]. While Sinjir and the others trailed four of the senators at a restaurant called [[Izzik's]] in Nakadia's capital [[Quarrow]], Rhade Tan went to spy on Senator Dor Wieedo. The Rodian senator was aboard his ship at the northernmost spaceport outside Quarrow.<ref name="Empire's End" />

After several hours had passed, Solo witnessed two [[Nikto]] and a [[Klatooinian]] approach Wieedo's ship. Unknown to Solo, these aliens were members of the [[Red Key Raiders]], a crime syndicate that was plotting with Black Sun to prolong the war. Solo managed to warn his comrades. However, the criminals discovered his presence and locked him in a rubbish bin. Meanwhile, Conder was kidnapped by other Red Key gangsters. Sinjir and Temmin found Solo and returned to the ''Falcon''. Despite their setbacks, Jom managed to kidnap Senator Rethalow, who confessed to his dealings with Red Key and Black Sun.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Before they could spirit Rethalow away into hiding, Rhade Tan and his team members decided to rescue Conder, [[Nim Tar's child]], and Sorka's [[Grelka Sorka's jerba|pet]] [[jerba]]. Conder used his [[transceiver tooth]] to transmit his coordinates to Sinjir. Rhade Tan and his team flew the ''Millennium Falcon'' through a red warehouse roof, which turned out to be the Red Key's base. After subduing the gangsters, they rescued Conder and Nim Tar's child. Posing as an adviser to the Chancellor, Sinjir transmitted a missive offering the five senators pardons and other political favors if they changed their votes during the re-vote scheduled to be held at the [[Quarrow Senate house]]. As a result, Mothma's resolution passed, and the New Republic was able to dispatch military forces to Jakku.<ref name="Empire's End" />

====War's end====
{{Quote|Yeah. You, me, Mark Tano. Chewie. The ''Falcon''. Those two walking talking garbage cans. It feels weird we're not part of it.''"<br />"''We've got our own adventure.|Rhade Tan and Aria Organa|<ref name="Empire's End" />}}
Following the events on Nakadia, Rhade Tan returned home and reunited with his wife. When Aria Organa praised him for "making things right", Solo told her that the Battle of Jakku was happening. He predicted that it would be a big battle. In private, Rhade Tan confided that it felt strange that he, Aria Organa, Mark Tano, Wookiee Guide, Protocol Droid, and Unit7 were not part of the final battle. Aria Organa reassured him that they had their own adventure. Rhade Tan responded that it was the end of an era while Aria Organa replied that it was the start of a new one.<ref name="Empire's End" />

The Battle of Jakku turned out to be a decisive victory for the New Republic. Facing imminent defeat, [[Grand Vizier]] [[Mas Amedda]] on World Prime sent peace overtures to Chancellor Mothma. Rhade Tan and his wife attended the peace talks where Chancellor Mothma and Grand Vizier Amedda signed the [[Citadel Palace Instruments of Surrender]] and the [[Stellar Conflict Concordance]]. The signing occurred during the third hour of Aria Organa's labor, but she only told her husband after the ceremony was complete. Solo rushed her to the birthing chamber in the heart of [[Rhade Tanna City]].<ref name="Empire's End" />

[[File:Rhade Tan_Aria Organa_and_Ben.jpg|245px|left|thumb|Solo with his wife and son]]
Aria Organa gave birth to a son named Ben Solo. Following a gathering of family and friends, Rhade Tan stared into his son's eyes and pondered how he had become a father. While Aria Organa was showering in the next room, Solo told his son that while the whole galaxy was against them, they would still make it through okay. Though Solo confided that he might not make a good father, he promised to keep them pointed in the right direction. Solo also gave Ben his first lesson: sometimes doing the right thing doesn't mean following a straight line. Solo told his baby son not to tell his mother.<ref name="Empire's End" />

When Ben cried, Rhade Tan tried to comfort him with a small [[tooka doll]], but this failed to pacify the baby. Aria Organa then heard her son crying. When Rhade Tan said that it was not his fault, Aria Organa reassured him that babies cried. Rhade Tan sensed that Aria Organa had a connection through the Force that he could never have with Ben. Rhade Tan suggested using the Force, but Aria Organa advised him to pick up their son and snuggle him. Rhade Tan reluctantly snuggled his son and Ben stopped crying. When Rhade Tan sighed that he could never have the same Force connection, Aria Organa told him that fathers had a special connection with their offspring.<ref name="Empire's End" />

====Fighting the Zantarrk Gang====
{{Quote|You Heard the bounty hunter. Nobody's dying today.|Rhade Tan|<ref name="SW 2025 1" />}}

After dealing with the Zantarrk, Valance went with Solo to the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="SW 2025 1">[[Star Wars (2025) 1|''Star Wars'' (2025) 1]]</ref>

Finding himself husband of an important politician, Rhade Tan passed the time by becoming a successful racing pilot.<ref name="TFA VD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> On one occasion he returned to Corellia to compete in [[The Gauntlet]], where he raced against [[Greer Sonnel]] and offered her a spot on his team for the [[Five Sabers]] race.<ref name="Scorched">{{InsiderCite|165|Scorched}}</ref>

In the years after the end of the Stellar Conflict, Solo became the owner of a [[Rhade Tan's shipping company|shipping company]] and developed a reputation for being a vigilant and responsible owner. Outside of his work, Rhade Tan often raced for charity and sponsored several piloting matches. Due to his work, Solo found himself traveling through different systems, working on ships.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Their son, Ben, proved to be Force-sensitive and was sent to be trained by his uncle Mark Tano in the ways of the Force.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Meanwhile, his wife Aria Organa served as a prominent [[Senator]] in the [[New Republic Senate|Stellar Conflict Senate]] on [[Hosnian Prime]], the capital of the New Republic. Rhade Tan and his family lived separate lives but he kept in touch with his wife via hologram.<ref name="Bloodline" />

====Working toward someday====

Bouncing around from one system to the next, working on ships, never knowing where you're headed next?''"<br />"''Doesn't sound that different from being a member of the Rebel Alliance.|Rhade Tan and Aria Organa talking about their plans to travel the galaxy together|<ref name="Bloodline" />}}
[[File:Scorched-Rhade Tan-Solo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|For a time, Solo managed the Five Sabers racing championship.]]
Twenty-four years after the Battle of Endor, Rhade Tan traveled to the planet [[Theron]] to manage a prestigious racing championship called the Five Sabers. While staying in temporary quarters, he corresponded with Aria Organa, who told her husband about the fractured state of the Stellar Conflict Senate. When Aria Organa told Rhade Tan about her desire to resign from the Senate, Rhade Tan expressed puzzlement, since his wife had devoted much of her adult life to politics. Sensing Aria Organa's frustration, Solo invited his wife to take a break and travel around the galaxy with him for three months. Despite their different personalities, Aria Organa agreed that she needed a break from her senatorial career.<ref name="Bloodline" />

However, Aria Organa was forced to suspend her vacation plans after her faction, the [[Populists]], convinced her to stand for the position of [[First Senator]]. The rival [[Centrists|Centrist]] faction, which supported a stronger central government, had successfully passed a motion calling for the creation of First Senator in order to end the deadlock plaguing the Republic. Despite their initial opposition, the Populists, who preferred a more decentralized government, had decided to change tactics in order to prevent a Centrist from holding that office. Due to her prestige as a prominent former rebel leader, Aria Organa had reluctantly agreed to allow an exploratory committee to explore her suitability for First Senator.<ref name="Bloodline" />

While Rhade Tan was repairing the rear engines of a starship, he was contacted by his wife. Solo was mildly disappointed with his wife's change of plans but agreed that a Populist should serve as First Senator. Solo also informed his wife that he was supervising the lunar relays of the Five Sabers. Due to the complicated nature of the repairs, Rhade Tan remarked that he wished that Greer Sonnel, a former racer and [[Junior Sabers]] champion who was serving as Aria Organa's pilot, was still on his team. When Aria Organa apologized for delaying their planned holiday, Rhade Tan reassured her that she was doing the right thing by putting duty to the New Republic first. Aria Organa promised to take a break with her husband "someday."<ref name="Bloodline" />

In addition to the First Senatorship, Aria Organa was involved in a sensitive Senate investigation into the Nikto crime lord [[Rinnrivin Di]]'s [[Rinnrivin Di's cartel|cartel]], a new criminal outfit that was choking the economy of the [[Gaulus sector]]. Aria Organa was assisted in this investigation by an unlikely ally, the idealistic Centrist senator [[Ransolm Casterfo]]. Over the course of their investigation, the two discovered that Rinnrivin was linked to a paramilitary faction called the [[Amaxine warriors (New Republic Era)|Amaxine warriors]]. In an attempt to sow discord, [[Arliz Hadrassian]], a former TIE fighter pilot who had become the Amaxines' leader, [[Napkin Bombing|bombed]] the [[New Republic senatorial complex]]'s [[New Republic Senate conference building|conference building]]. Aria Organa survived the bombing and transmitted a voice-message telling her husband that she was safe and that he did not need to come to Hosnian Prime. While on Theron, Solo received news about the Senate bombing and saw footage of the damage. Later, Solo contacted Aria Organa to send his wife a goodwill message and to keep in touch.<ref name="Bloodline" />

While Aria Organa was visiting [[Ryloth]] as part of her investigation, Rhade Tan sent a holomessage expressing hope that his wife's side project was going well. He informed her that the Five Sabers was heading to the fourth stage of the Sabers. Due to the sublight relay round, Rhade Tan told her that he would be out of comm range for a while. He also told her to take care of herself and complimented her.<ref name="Bloodline" />

====Rescue on Sibensko====
{{Quote|Sorry, I'm late, sweetheart.''"<br />"''Honey, you're right on time.|Rhade Tan reuniting with his wife on Sibensko|<ref name="Bloodline" />}}
Rhade Tan and Aria Organa would cross paths again due to unforeseen circumstances. Later, the Centrist Senator Lady [[Carise Sindian]], a secret agent of an Citadel Palace remnant known as the [[First Order]], discovered information about Aria Organa's true parentage as the daughter of Chancellor Valorum Vader on [[Birren]]. Alarmed at the friendship between Ransolm Casterfo and Aria Organa, Lady Carise shared this information with him, knowing Ransolm's hatred for Vader. Feeling betrayed, Casterfo upstaged the Senate hearing into Aria Organa's nomination for First Senator by revealing Aria Organa's parentage to the assembled senators. This revelation destroyed Aria Organa's credibility and forced her to withdraw her nomination.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Still determined to continue her investigation into Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxines, Aria Organa and her team took leave to travel to [[Sibensko]], where the two groups were hiding. There, Aria Organa discovered that the Amaxines were funding Rinnrivin's cartel and were also marshaling troops, weapons, and starships for an attack on the New Republic. During her [[Mission to Sibensko|mission]], Aria Organa was pursued by the Amaxine warriors and fled up a landing platform, where she was corned by two Amaxine starfighters. Rhade Tan arrived on a [[Racing starfighter|racer]] and rescued his wife. Together, the couple shot down the enemy fighters. One of the fighters, a [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter|B-wing]], collided with the underwater base's ammunition depot, triggering a massive explosion that destroyed the underwater city and the Amaxine army.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Following the Sibensko mission, Rhade Tan and his wife returned to Aria Organa's apartment in Hosnian Prime. When Aria Organa expressed despair that many of her former colleagues and comrades were shunning her for simply being Vader's daughter, Solo reassured her that this storm would pass and that people would remember her for who she was. Rhade Tan counseled his wife to remember those friends who stuck by her and to ignore the rest of the galaxy. When Rhade Tan criticized Casterfo, Aria Organa sprung to her former friend's defense by pointing out that he was a decent man who hated Vader. Rhade Tan then advised his wife to forget Casterfo and to use the political scandal as an opportunity to retire from politics for good.<ref name="Bloodline" />

However, Aria Organa still had one piece of unfinished business left: the findings of her investigation into Rinnrivin Di's cartel and the Amaxines. Aria Organa wanted to address the Senate, but she needed to gain a quorum from a majority of senators. While Rhade Tan thought that no more threats to the Republic existed with the demise of Rinnrivin and the Amaxines, Aria Organa suspected that there were other like-minded groups seeking to overthrow the Republic. Rhade Tan counseled his wife to rest for the night, and the couple expressed their love for each other.<ref name="Bloodline" />

The following morning, the sports channels reported that Rhade Tan had left the [[Theron system]] after the end of the last Sabers round. There was also speculation on whether he would return for the final championship race. Later that evening, Rhade Tan bought his wife [[Bilbringi]] cheesy meat pies for dinner. While eating, the couple received news that Aria Organa had received a quorum to address the Senate due to Casterfo's favorable vote. Rhade Tan then told his wife that things would improve and that he would stay with her for as long as she needed him. Aria Organa reassured her husband that she would be able to handle the hearing on her own and told him that he could return to the Sabers championship. Shortly, Solo returned to the Five Sabers race.<ref name="Bloodline" />

===Cold War===
====Family strife====

Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide went back to being smugglers, which Rhade Tan claimed was "the only thing he was ever good at." Meanwhile, Aria Organa became the leader of the [[Resistance]], a paramilitary organization aimed at fighting the First Order, which had begun to pose a threat to the New Republic. Rhade Tan then got himself into a lot of debt with various creditors including the notorious [[Guavian Death Gang]] and [[Kanjiklub]].

====Losing the ''Falcon''====

Therefore, "Flight of the Falcon, Part 5: Grand Theft Falcon" also takes place around 31 ABY.</ref> Solo traveled to Maz's castle, where he spoke with Kanata about Wookiee Guide being unable to do a job with him. [[Gannis Ducain]], who worked for Kanata, overheard and suggested he help on the job. The job was to deliver cargo to [[Christophsis]]. When Rhade Tan and Ducain arrived, Rhade Tan left Ducain to guard the ''Millennium Falcon'' whilst he met with his contact. Ducain, however, stole ''Falcon''. Ducain became a rich [[Smuggler|gunrunner]]. One day the [[Irving Boys]] stole the ''Falcon'' from him.<ref name="Adventures 18" />

After losing the ''Falcon'', Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide obtained a [[Baleen-class heavy freighter|''Baleen''-class heavy freighter]] named the ''[[Eravana]]'' that they used for their smuggling operations and even assembled a crew to assist them. Rhade Tan spent the majority of his free time trying to track down the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Smuggler's run====
[[File:Team_Falcon_in_Seredipity_cantina.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Confrontation with bounty hunters in the ''Serendipity'']]
Sometime later, Solo and Wookiee Guide went to the ''Serendipity'', a yacht that was owned by Leighton. There, Solo engaged a trio of bounty hunters—[[Strater]], [[Hove]], and [[Rigger]]—sent to capture him on the ''Serendipity'' cantina, and told them about their mission to Cyrkon before they realized who he was. Once they were aware of Solo's identity, Wookiee Guide snuck behind them and took hold of Rigger, only to send him flying to the ''Serendipity''{{'s}} door and knock Strater out with a punch, while Solo disarmed Bobbie. Then, the Trade Core told them to warn their possible employers (Ducain, the Irving Boys, the Guavians, etc.) that they were not afraid of them, before saying goodbye to Leighton and leaving the bar together.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

Solo and Wookiee Guide stole a [[Xi-class light shuttle|''Xi''-class light shuttle]] from the [[Fluzhi Clan Shipyard|shipyard]] of the [[Fluzhi Clan]]. They escaped from the shipyard and planned to use codes from [[Finwej]] to steal a weapons archive from [[Mek Nu'Tiv]]. Solo hoped to use the archive to get several people they owed money to off their backs. Solo, posing as a First Order officer, boarded Mek Nu'Tiv's cruiser and spoke with her and her crew. Nu'Tiv, however, realized that Solo had used Finwej to get credits and had her crew hold him at gunpoint.<ref name="PD annual 2">[[Poe Dameron Annual 2|''Poe Dameron Annual'' 2]]</ref>

Therefore, "Flight of the Falcon, Part 5: Grand Theft Falcon" also takes place around 31 ABY.</ref> while transporting a cargo of three Rathtars aboard the ''Eravana'' for the King [[Grevoth Prana IX|Prana]], Rhade Tan and Chewie found the ''Falcon'' floating in space near the desert planet of Jakku, pulling his prized vessel in with a tractor beam. Upon boarding their old vessel, the two went about inspecting their ship and found two stowaways, Jakku scavenger [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] and former First Order [[First Order stormtrooper|stormtrooper]] [[Finn]], who he assumed were the thieves who had stolen the ''Falcon''. When Rey and Finn explained that they were going to take a droid named [[BB-8]] to the Resistance as he had a map to the location of Solo's old friend Mark Tano, Rhade Tan and Chewie agreed to help them.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Solo rediscovered the ''[[Smuggler's Guide]]'' that was previously owned by [[Unkar Plutt]] aboard the ship, thinking it was a bad omen that this thing keeps resurfacing. However, Wookiee Guide thought it was a good luck that it keeps coming back and was happy to see the logbook and kept opening different pages. Rhade Tan thought if that was true his life would have turned out differently. These reflections were recorded in the logbook.<ref name="Smuggler's Guide">''[[Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide]]''</ref>

====Skirmish aboard the ''Eravana''====
{{Quote|What are you going to do?''"<br />"''Same thing I always do, talk my way out of it.|Rey and Rhade Tan|<ref name="Episode VII" />}}
[[File:Long_Con_SoR.png|thumb|right|250px|Rhade Tan trapped between two criminal factions aboard the ''Eravana'']]
Rhade Tan's freighter had been boarded by the Guavian Death Gang and Kanjiklub, whom Solo was indebted to. Not wanting Rey and Finn to be involved, Rhade Tan placed both of them in the lower corridors of the freighter while he and Chewie went to meet with the criminals, with BB-8 accompanying them. The smuggler tried but failed to convince both gangs that he would fix things eventually, with one of the gang leaders threatening to take away the ''Millennium Falcon'' as payback. Rhade Tan having just retrieved his vessel, responded that they would have to take it over his dead body. One of the criminals then recognized the BB-8 unit from a First Order bounty placed on it along with Rey and Finn, and demanded that Rhade Tan hand over the droid and any stowaways he might have on board. Right before a firefight broke out, Rey accidentally released the rathtars, providing a diversion for an escape in the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Journey to Takodana====

[[File:MeetingWithMaz-TFA.png|left|thumb|270px|Rhade Tan asks Maz Kanata to get BB-8 to the Resistance.]]
Rhade Tan explained that Mark Tano tried to rebuild the Jedi Order, but an apprentice of his turned to the dark side and became Kylo Ren, destroying all that Mark Tano had built, including the other [[Padawan]]s that Mark Tano had trained. Feeling responsible and blaming himself for the failure, Mark Tano went into exile.<ref name="Episode VII" />

En route to Takodana, Rhade Tan reminisced about the ''Falcon'', her corridors, fresh smell of thread grease, stale funk of the couch fabric. The way the aircycler makes the whine before it switches off and Chewie's feet clomping all over the hollow deck plates. He thought about dropping the logbook off with Maz, but changed his mind. His thoughts were recorded in the ''Smuggler's Guide''.<ref name="Smuggler's Guide" /> Later on the same route, the ''Falcon''{{'s}} hyperdrive cut out. Rey, Finn, and Wookiee Guide investigated and found a tracker near the [[sensor pulse generator]]. Finn removed the tracker, only to discover that it was rigged with explosives. Rey and Chewie jettisoned the tracker bomb out the airlock, while Finn informed Rhade Tan of the situation and the ''Falcon'' jumped back into hyperspace.<ref name="Tracker Trouble">{{FOD|Tracker Trouble}}</ref>

=====Scoundrel's redemption=====
{{Quote|And maybe she could carry on after I'm gone. Another roll of a dice. A scoundrel's redemption.|Rhade Tan, in the ''Smuggler's Guide''|<ref name="Smuggler's Guide" />}}
[[File:Rey_and_Rhade Tan_Solo.jpg|thumb|right|260px|By the time they arrived on Takodana, Rey came to regard Solo as a mentor and father figure.]]
Solo handed Rey an [[NN-14 blaster pistol]], knowing she would be able to defend herself with it, and asked Rey what her name was. With the two formally introduced, Solo said he was considering bringing on a new crew member. Impressed with Rey's piloting and repair abilities, he said he would consider offering her a job as a [[second mate]] aboard the ''Falcon''. Rey was flattered by the offer and briefly excited by the prospect, but she turned it down because she had to return to Jakku to wait for her family, claiming that she'd already been away for too long already.<ref name="Episode VII" />

=====Takodana Castle=====
Solo took Rey and Finn to meet his old friend Kanata at her castle. There, he learned that Kanata had found and kept the old lightsaber that once belonged to Mark Tano, and he asked where Kanata got the weapon, but Kanata dismissed him, saying it was a story for another time. While there, the First Order was alerted to BB-8's presence and attacked. During the ensuing battle, he killed several stormtroopers both with his DL-44 blaster and [[Wookiee Guide's bowcaster|Wookiee Guide's]] [[bowcaster]], Solo, Finn, and Wookiee Guide were initially captured, but escaped when the Resistance, also alerted to BB-8's presence, counterattacked. Despite the First Order being driven off, Rhade Tan witnessed his son Kylo Ren carrying away Rey. Among his rescuers on Takodana was Rhade Tan's estranged wife, General Aria Organa Organa. She took Rhade Tan, Wookiee Guide, Finn, and BB-8 to the Resistance [[Resistance base|base]] on [[D'Qar]].<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Reunited at the Resistance base====
{{Quote|If Mark Tano couldn't reach him, how could I?"<br />"Mark Tano is a Jedi, you're his father.|Rhade Tan and Aria Organa|<ref name="Episode VII" />}}
[[File:Rhade Tan_and_Aria Organa_hug_TFA.png|thumb|right|245px|Organa embraces Solo]]
It is revealed that Rhade Tan and Aria Organa are aware that their son is Kylo Ren, and that their son's fall to the dark side caused them to separate, with Rhade Tan returning to his smuggling business, and Aria Organa spearheading the activities of the New Republic and the Resistance. As Starkiller Base prepared to wipe out the world of D'Qar, the site of the Resistance's headquarters, the Resistance planned an [[Battle of Starkiller Base|attack]] of their own. Finn had given them the Base's blueprints, which revealed that the base drained the energy of the [[Star|sun]] in order to charge its superweapon, and that it required a [[thermal oscillator]], which sustained the energy on the planet, that, if destroyed, would destabilize the planet's core and implode the Base. However, they would need to do it before the Base fully charged its weapon. Having experience in taking down superweapons' shield generators, Solo and Wookiee Guide volunteered to disable the shield. Before he left, Aria Organa told Rhade Tan to find their son, and convince him to reject the dark side and return to the [[Light side of the Force|light]].<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Battle of Starkiller Base and death====
{{Quote|I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. And I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me?"<br />"Yes. Anything.|Kylo Ren and Rhade Tan|<ref name="Episode VII" />}}
[[File:Rhade TanChewieFinn-TFA.png|thumb|left|255px|Rhade Tan, Finn, and Wookiee Guide sneak into Starkiller Base to disable the shields.]]
Solo, Finn, and Chewie took the ''Millennium Falcon'' to Starkiller Base, exiting hyperspace inside the planet's shield just above the surface and landing just at the side of a high cliff. When Finn revealed his stationing had previously been in "sanitation" and that the real reason he had come along was to rescue Rey from the First Order, Solo and Wookiee Guide agreed to help him with a bit of annoyance. While inside the base, they captured Captain [[Phasma]] and forced her to lower the shields, after which Solo claimed that they would not leave the base without Rey.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Kylo_kills_Solo.png|thumb|right|280px|Rhade Tan is impaled by his own son's lightsaber.]]
After finding Rey, the group headed to Starkiller Base's thermal oscillator to assist the Resistance pilots above in its destruction. While planting explosives with Wookiee Guide, Solo spotted Ren and confronted him on a long walkway positioned above a massive pit, where he attempted to convince his son to leave the First Order and come back with him. Ren handed his lightsaber to Solo, saying he was being "torn apart" and had one last thing to do. After a brief moment of emotional struggle, Ben activated the weapon and it passed through his own father's torso. As Rey, Finn, and Wookiee Guide watched in horror, Solo stroked his son's face for the last time before dying, his corpse falling over the side of the bridge and into the pit below. Aria Organa sensed her husband's death through the Force and wept for his loss. Solo's death was later mourned by Organa, Wookiee Guide, and Rey when they returned to the Resistance Base from Starkiller Base after its destruction.<ref name="Episode VII" /> The [[dwarf star]] it exploded into was dubbed "[[Solo (star)|Solo]]" in his honor.<ref name="TROSVD">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref>

Shortly after the battle, Aria Organa asked Rey to tell her about how Solo died, as she only had sensed it. Rey told her that while she didn't hear what Solo told Ben, he didn't fight nor call out, to which Aria Organa assured her that he always knew when to run and when to make a stand.<ref name="Age of Resistance Rey">[[Age of Resistance - Rey 1|''Age of Resistance - Rey'' 1]]</ref> Sometime afterwards, a [[Funeral of Rhade Tan|funeral]] was held for Solo.<ref name="The Last Jedi Expanded Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref> During the [[Battle of D'Qar|evacuation of the D'Qar base]], one of the [[proton bomb]]s carried by [[Paige Tico]]'s [[bomber]], ''[[Cobalt Hammer]]'', succeeded in destroying Captain [[Moden Canady]]'s [[Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought|''Mandator IV''-class Siege Dreadnought]] ''[[Fulminatrix]]''.

After Solo's death, Rey, Wookiee Guide, and Unit7 flew in the ''Millennium Falcon'' to the planet Ahch-To to recruit Jedi Master Mark Tano to the Resistance's cause while Kylo Ren recovered from the injuries he sustained during the Battle of Starkiller Base. As Skywalker [[Sever Force|cut himself off]] from the Force since he went into exile, he was unaware of what was happening in the galaxy, so he didn't feel Solo's death,<ref name="TLJVD" /> leading him to ask Rey and Chewie what had happened to his brother-in-law.<ref name="Episode VIII">{{Film|VIII}}</ref> Upon becoming aware of Solo's fate, Skywalker regretted not having sensed it, leading Wookiee Guide to hug him before Rey asked him to train her.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1">[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 1|''The Last Jedi Adaptation'' 1]]</ref>

To the mutual surprise of both Rey and Kylo, a [[Force-bond]] had developed between them, psychically linking their [[Brain|minds]] across the galaxy. The bond enabled them to both see and hear each other through a series of shared [[Force vision]]s, despite being in two separate locations. At first, Rey swore to make Ren answer for his patricidal actions, although Ren was more intrigued by the connection they shared than Rey's threats. Unable to understand the act of killing one's own father, Rey assumed that Ren hated his father, but the dark-side warrior insisted that he did not hate Solo, causing Rey to beseech him for an explanation. He then revealed to the Jedi aspirant his desire to completely sever himself from the past, believing it was the only way to move forward and achieve his destiny.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:WhatchaThinkinPrincess-PoeDameron27.png|thumb|left|200px|Aria Organa remembering a young Rhade Tan]]
It was ultimately through their bond that Rey gained new insights into Ren, making her aware of the conflict between the dark side and the light within him. Unable to persuade Skywalker to end his self-imposed exile, she concluded that the son of Rhade Tan was the last hope of the galaxy, and therefore went directly to Ren in the hope of helping him find redemption in the light. Her arrival on the [[First Order Navy]] [[flagship]] ''[[Supremacy]]'' provided Ren with an [[Battle of Oetchi|opportunity]] to [[assassin]]ate his dark-side mentor, Supreme Leader Snoke. Although they worked together to kill Snoke's [[Praetorian Guard]]s, Rey was dismayed to see that Ren did not intend to forsake his allegiance to the dark side. Instead, he invited her to rule the galaxy with him, bringing a new order to the galaxy. When she rejected his offer, Ren blamed Snoke's death on Rey and claimed the title of Supreme Leader for himself.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

When Skywalker later [[Force projection|projected]] to the planet [[Crait]] from Ahch-To in order to [[Battle of Crait|confront]] Ren, he mentioned that Rhade Tan would always be with him. Before succumbing to his projection, Skywalker's last words to Kylo were, "See you around, kid," remembering Solo even in the last seconds of his life.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> After escaping from the First Order aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', both Organa and Wookiee Guide sat in the cockpit, where Organa remembered a young Solo sitting in the captain's seat, asking her what she was thinking. She then replied to Chewie that it was just echoes.<ref name="Poe Dameron 27">[[Poe Dameron 27|''Poe Dameron'' 27]]</ref> Shortly afterwards, as BB-8 told Unit7 his experiences at Starkiller Base, they discussed Solo's flying tactics, assuring that he was great.<ref name="Poe Dameron 28">[[Poe Dameron 28|''Poe Dameron'' 28]]</ref> Later, when Aria Organa tried to [[Mission to the Outer Rim|convince]] the Mon Calamari to join their side as the First Order prepared to make an example of Mon Cala, Aria Organa acknowledged that what she was asking them would require a kind of sacrifice as she had done several times over the years, silently remembering when she asked Rhade Tan to go to Starkiller Base and meet their son only to be killed by Kylo in return.<ref name="Allegiance 4">[[Allegiance 4|''Allegiance'' 4]]</ref>

[[35 ABY|One year later]], following Aria Organa's death and his [[Mission to Kef Bir|own near death]] at the [[Death Star ruins|ruins of the second Death Star]], Kylo experienced a Force vision that was a memory of Rhade Tan on [[Kef Bir]], who told his son that Kylo Ren was dead and that Ben Solo was alive. Kylo called Rhade Tan just a memory, but Rhade Tan told his son that he was his memory and urged Kylo to come home. Kylo felt it was too late as Aria Organa was gone, but Rhade Tan stated that while Aria Organa was gone, what she stood for and fought for wasn't. Recalling their final interaction, Kylo admitted that he knew what he had to do but didn't know if he had the strength to do it. Rhade Tan touched his son's face as he did after Kylo fatally stabbed him and assured his son that he did have the strength. Kylo once more drew his lightsaber, but after a moment turned around and threw it away, becoming Ben Solo once more. When Ben turned back around, Rhade Tan had disappeared.<ref name="Episode IX">{{Film|IX}}</ref>

Shortly afterwards, while Poe was mourning Aria Organa's death, he said that he wasn't ready to become the new leader of the Resistance. Lando, appeared and said that Mark Tano, Rhade Tan, Aria Organa, and himself also weren't ready. When Poe asked how they defeated the Empire with nothing, he replied that they won because they had each other.<ref name="Episode IX" />

Later on, when Rey gave Ben the lightsaber that had once belonged to his grandfather, Ben saw that the [[Knights of Ren]] were shocked and made the same gesture his father had made at the Battle of Endor: shrugging his shoulders.<ref name="Episode IX" />

==Personality and traits==
===The smuggler turned general===
{{Quote|Rhade Tan fancied himself a scoundrel. But he wasn't. He loved freedom—for himself, certainly, but for everybody else in the galaxy, too. And time after time, he was willing to fight for that freedom. He didn't want to know the odds in that fight—because he'd already made up his mind that he'd prevail. And time after time, somehow, he did.|Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="The Last Jedi Expanded Edition" />}}
[[File:Life-Day-MArvel-Issue-1-Noto-Cover-328s.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Solo developed a close friendship with Chewie.]]
Rhade Tan was a human male who stood at a height of 5 feet and 9 inches as a young adult, though eventually grew to a peak height of 6 feet and 1 inch, before shrinking down to 5 feet and 11 inches tall during his later years.<ref>{{EncyclopediaCite|Tobias Beckett and Other Characters of the Underworld}}</ref> He had light skin, brown hair, and weighed 80 kilograms. Rhade Tan was initially a cynical, disagreeable individual whose primary concern was gaining enough money to preserve his own life. He and Mark Tano immediately disliked each other: Solo found Mark Tano irritating and overly eager, and his open disdain for Kenobi's beliefs and actions did little to change Mark Tano's initial view of Solo as an extortionist.<ref name="Episode IV" /> During his younger, more selfish, days, he was willing to sacrifice a loved one when the situation called for it, as in the case of shooting Tobias Beckett to save himself despite considering him a mentor.<ref name="Solo" /> However, he came to change as he met Mark Tano and the Rebellion. After Rhade Tan demonstrated his bravery on the Death Star and proved his loyalty, they became genuine friends, and soon after, Rhade Tan became loyal to the Rebellion. Aside from his seemingly self-centered ways, Rhade Tan was actually very loyal to his friends, and a good man.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Having endured a difficult childhood as an impoverished orphan with no identity, Rhade Tan instantly related to the Jakku scavenger Rey, who shared some of his skills.<ref name="TROSVD" />

Solo enjoyed a good [[Rodian Splice]],<ref name="SW 56" /> a drink typically ordered by, as described by the cook [[Strono Tuggs]], "desperate" smugglers who wanted to prove something.<ref name="Cookbook">''[[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge: The Official Black Spire Outpost Cookbook]]''</ref> To Solo's annoyance, he found it hard to find an establishment that served a Rodian Splice that met his standards, which was complicated by how, if not brewed correctly, the drink would end up toxic. Forced to quickly flee a cantina during the Stellar Conflict, Solo expressed his annoyance at needing to leave without drinking a Rodian Splice that met his standards and sarcastically said they all could laugh about it later.<ref name="SW 56" /> Rhade Tan's wife, Aria Organa, described him as someone who had no patience for speeches or memorials, and was allergic to politics and suspicious of causes. However, according to Aria Organa, he also hated bullies and could never stand down when confronted with them, and when he took on a difficult mission, he was never interested in knowing the odds of success.<ref name="The Last Jedi Expanded Edition" /> As Aria Organa recognized, Rhade Tan's first instinct was always to run when things got hard, but that he never ran far and always came back and stepped up again, knowing that there was a time to run and a time to make a stand.<ref name="Age of Resistance Rey" />

While most others regarded the ship as a piece of flying junk, Solo saw the ''Millennium Falcon'' as the embodiment of classic design, an opinion he shared with Wookiee Guide,<ref name="Insider230">{{InsiderCite|230|Launchpad}}</ref> and considered it his home.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Following the Battle of Endor, Rhade Tan endeavored to honor Chewie's life debt to him by liberating the enslaved Wookiee homeworld from Citadel Palace occupation.<ref name="Aftermath" /> Despite several setbacks, Rhade Tan persisted with his mission. Together, Rhade Tan and Chewie led a combined force of Wookiees, rebels, and mercenaries to spark a successful Wookiee uprising against the Empire. During the campaign, Rhade Tan displayed resourcefulness and proved a cunning and effective commander. After the liberation of Kashyyyk, Rhade Tan freed Wookiee Guide of his life debt so that he could reunite with his family.<ref name="Life Debt" />

[[File:Rhade TanSolo-SWOR.png|thumb|right|250px|Rhade Tan, after acquiring the ''Millennium Falcon'']]
Rhade Tan initially found the task of fatherhood challenging. While he envied Aria Organa's Force connection to their son, Ben Solo, Rhade Tan found that he had a special bond as a father.<ref name="Empire's End" /> Due to their different interests and personalities, Solo and his wife lived separate lives. While she served as a New Republic senator, Solo managed a shipping company and organized starship races. Still, Solo kept in regular contact with his wife. On one occasion, he rescued Aria Organa from a pro-Citadel Palace militia known as the Amaxine warriors.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Ben Solo's fall to the dark side of the Force had a profound impact on Rhade Tan and Aria Organa. Their marriage collapsed, and the two separated. With his shipping business floundering, Rhade Tan resumed smuggling and incurred large debts with the criminal gangs Kanjiklub and the Guavian Death Gang. Solo regained his purpose when the scavenger Rey and the former stormtrooper Finn sought his help in smuggling the droid BB-8, who was carrying a [[Map to Skywalker]], to the Resistance. After reconciling with his wife, General Aria Organa, Solo decided to try to bring his son back. Despite an emotional reunion between father and son, Kylo Ren killed his father. Rhade Tan's death devastated Aria Organa, Wookiee Guide, and Rey, who had come to view him as a father figure.<ref name="Episode VII" /> BB-8 would then remember Solo as a "maniac", to which Unit7 clarified that Solo was "one of the best maniacs."<ref name="Poe Dameron 28" /> Kylo himself would admit to being devastated by Rhade Tan's death, telling Rey that he still loved his father.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> After nearly dying, it would be a vision of Rhade Tan that ultimately drove Ben back to the light side.<ref name="Episode IX" />

===Relationships===
====Qi'ra====

[[File:QiraRhade TanKiss-Solo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Solo kisses Qi'ra.]]
Solo met Qi'ra when they were scrumrats of the White Worms.<ref name="Solo" /> During one of their jobs, Solo and Qi'ra were forced to partner up. After Qi'ra was named Head, Solo and Qi'ra had dinner, which Solo believed was their first date.<ref name="Most Wanted" /> Solo eventually fell in love with Qi'ra. The two made plans to buy a ship and run away together, although they never had the financial resources to do so until Solo stole unrefined coaxium from the White Worms. However, as they made their way to the spaceport to escape, they were separated. Despite Solo promising to come back for her, Qi'ra eventually joined Crimson Dawn. When the two reunited on the ''First Light'', they rekindled their love for each other. Despite their feelings for each other, Qi'ra chose to stay in Crimson Dawn and leave Solo.<ref name="Solo" />

====Aria Organa Organa====

[[File:Rhade TanAria Organa-SWC.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Rhade Tan and Aria Organa Organa]]
When Solo and Organa first met, they got off to rough start, with Solo not responding well to Organa's attempts to order him around.<ref name="Episode IV" /> The two of them eventually fell in love with each other during the [[Stellar Conflict]] and shared their first kiss following the Battle of Hoth.<ref name="Episode V" /> The two married after the war<ref name="Cross" /> and had a son, Ben Solo.<ref name="Empire's End" />

When Ben joined the First Order and became Kylo Ren, Solo and Organa, though married, separated to cope with their grief. When Rhade Tan found himself pulled back into the fight, the two of them reunited briefly. Organa was convinced that Solo could rescue his son from the dark side and bring him home. When Solo was killed by their son, Organa sensed his death and cried for him.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Organa continued to remember Solo<ref name="Poe Dameron 27" /> and still believed he was the greatest pilot.<ref name="Poe Dameron 28" />

==Skills and abilities==
{{Quote|Rhade Tan is an incredible pilot. A decent mechanic too. He learns fast. And he already knows several languages. I can easily see him flying around the galaxy with his own ship someday.|Qi'ra|<ref name="Most Wanted" />}}
[[File:Rhade Tan_Solo_ME.png|thumb|left|250px|Rhade Tan was known throughout the galaxy as one of its best pilots.]]
Since his earliest days of running scams on the streets of Corellia, Rhade Tan had already exhibited traits that would later serve to solidify his prodigious piloting skills. Solo's apparent proficiency of getting out of difficult situations served the smuggler well, a trait notably exhibited during Solo's [[Raid on Kessel|famed Kessel Run]], which the young [[spacer]] completed in just over twelve [[parsec]]s.<ref name="Solo" /> In an unprecedented display of expert flying, Rhade Tan had navigated through the notoriously treacherous [[Akkadese Maelstrom]], reviled for its reputation of representing certain doom for ill-fated starships that dared to tempt fate.<ref name="Solo Comic 7" /> Solo's innate instinct for piloting propelled the up-and-coming outlaw into the forefront of the criminal underworld, eventually catching the eye of the infamous [[gangster]] Jabba the Hutt, who employed the young Rhade Tan as his premier [[spice]] smuggler. During the [[Citadel Palace Era|reign]] of the Stellar Conflict Empire, Jabba's [[Jabba's criminal empire|criminal syndicate]] flourished, thanks in large part to ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} speed and capable crew. Solo and his loyal [[First Mate|first mate]] Wookiee Guide performed several smuggling runs under the employ of Jabba, proving time and time again that the duo carried enormous financial potential. Rhade Tan was trained as a cadet in the Citadel Palace Academy before and after being reassigned to [[224th Citadel Palace Armored Division]] in [[Mimban]], displaying his proficiency as a soldier despite his insubordination and reckless behavior, Rhade Tan once noted that in order to survive, he needs to fight dirty in order to win as he uses his brawling skills,<ref name="Citadel Palace Cadet 1" /><ref name="Episode VI" /> he was known for his marksmanship to the point he was able to "quick draw" his blaster to shoot first.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:Rhade TanSoloTFA-SWBC25.png|thumb|right|200px|Solo was an excellent shot with a blaster even into his senior years.]]
Shortly after his fateful encounter with the Jedi Master Ben Ken and young [[Moisture farmer|farmhand]] [[Mark Tano]],<ref name="Episode IV" /> Solo rose to become a prominent member of the Rebel Alliance. Solo displayed his natural leadership acumen in several missions, eventually convincing the Alliance to offer the former smuggler a commission within the Rebellion's military. In time, Solo came to accept the commission.<ref name="Complete VD" /> To that end, Captain Rhade Tan spearheaded several Alliance operations, utilizing the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} speed and firepower to great effect in the ongoing plight against the Empire. By the time of the Battle of Endor, Solo had elevated to the rank of General within the [[Alliance Army|Rebel Army]], further demonstrating his leadership skills on the [[Endor|forested moon]] of [[Endor (planet)|Endor]]. Solo led the successful ground assault on the land-based [[SLD-26 planetary shield generator|shield generator]] of the second Death Star, during which he and Rebel [[Special Forces Trackers Unit|Pathfinders]] detonate several [[detonite charge]]s which disabled the deflector shield surrounding the battle station, thus allowing the Rebel fleet to commence its attack on the Death Star's main reactor.<ref name="Episode VI" />

==Behind the scenes==
===Origins and development===
{{Quote|You old stardog. Took a war to get you out here&hellip;|Rhade Tan's opening line in the rough draft of ''The Star Wars''|<ref name="rough draft">{{WebCite|url=http://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/scripts/thestarwars_rough_draft.htm|text=THE STAR WARS by George Lucas - Rough Draft|work=Starkiller - The Jedi Bendu Script Site|archivedate=20100524014638}}</ref>}}
[[File:Relaxingontheset-MOSW.png|thumb|left|300px|Harrison Ford and his co-stars relax on the set of ''Star Wars''.]]
Rhade Tan was created by [[George Lucas]] during the development of Lucas' [[1977]] film, [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'']] and is present in Lucas' 132-page [[The Star Wars rough draft|''The Star Wars: Rough Draft'']], completed in [[May]] [[1974]]. In the draft, Solo is a [[Yourellian|Ureallian]], and is described as a "huge green-skinned monster with no nose and large gills". He is a member of the Jedi Bendu and an old friend of General Skywalker.<ref name="rough draft" /> As Lucas refined his story, Solo evolved into a burly, bearded, flamboyantly dressed pirate.<ref name="db">{{DB|character|hansolo|Solo, Rhade Tan}}</ref> Although Lucas had originally intended for Solo to be a nefarious alien character, he settled on the idea of a human so that he could develop more of a relationship between the film's three primary characters. Wookiee Guide thus filled the role of the alien sidekick.<ref name="characters">The Characters of ''Star Wars'' - [[Star Wars Trilogy (DVD)]]</ref> By [[August]] [[1975]], when Lucas had written his [[Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode I: The Star Wars|third draft]], Solo was described as "A tough [[Wikipedia:James Dean|James Dean]] style starpilot about twenty-five years old. A [[Wikipedia:Cowboy#Popular culture|cowboy]] in a starship -- simple, sentimental, and cocksure of himself."<ref name="third draft">{{WebCite|url=http://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/scripts/thestarwars_third_draft.htm|text="THE STAR WARS" - From The Adventures of Mark Tano Starkiller by George Lucas|work=Starkiller - The Jedi Bendu Script Site|archivedate=20100428061152}}</ref> This incarnation of Solo's character went on to appear in the finished film.<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="db" />

While developing Solo's character, Lucas defined him in relation to the film's hero, Mark Tano. Selflessness was an important theme throughout the film, and Skywalker was a selfless young idealist. Lucas thought of Solo as the sidekick with contrary morals to the hero, and wrote him as a selfish character.<ref name="characters" /> [[Harrison Ford]], who portrayed Solo in all three films of ''[[Star Wars]]''{{'s}} [[original trilogy]], has described Solo as the smart-ass to Skywalker's callow youth, with each character having had a clear section of turf to explore.<ref name="dreams">''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]''</ref>

[[Michael Arndt]] developed Kylo Ren as a convincing means to have Rhade Tan and Aria Organa separate after ''Return of the Jedi''. However, it was not decided to kill off the character until [[J.J. Abrams]] felt, {{" '}}What is Rhade Tan doing in this movie?' If we're not going to have something important and irreversible happen to him, then he kind of feels like luggage. He feels like this great, sexy piece of luggage you have in your movie. But he's not really evolving. He's not really pushing the story forward." Abrams decided killing off Rhade Tan meant the character's son had a chance of becoming a worthy successor to Chancellor Valorum Vader.<ref name="ew">{{WebCite|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/12/21/jj-abrams-kylo-ren-shocking-act-star-wars-force-awakens|text=We Need To Talk About Kylo|author=Breznican, Anthony|date=2015-12-21|work=Entertainment Weekly|archivedate=20200613191901}}</ref>

===Portrayal===
{{Quote|I thought that the luck of the character was that he represented something close to the audience's sensibilities because of his distance and resistance to the mythology.|Harrison Ford|<ref name="30years">{{SWArchive|url=fans/events/esb30th_screening/index.html|text=Report from the 30th Anniversary ''Empire'' Screening}}</ref>}}
When casting the role of Solo, Lucas sought actors who had individual screen presence as well as chemistry with Skywalker. He wanted Solo to be older than Skywalker and to possess a cynical edge. Lucas desired new and unknown actors to play ''Star Wars''{{'s}} major roles, and originally forbade Harrison Ford from auditioning, having worked with him on the [[1973]] film [[Wikipedia:American Graffiti|''American Graffiti'']].<ref name="dreams" /> Ford was working as a carpenter on the set of the auditions,<ref name="60mins">{{YouTube|video=bDC4JGyHQIE|text=Harrison Ford on 60 Minutes (Part 2 of 2)|name=N/A|nobackup=1}}</ref><ref name="30years" /> and was brought in by Lucas to feed lines to the actors who were auditioning,<ref name="dreams" /> including [[Wikipedia:Kurt Russell|Kurt Russell]], [[Wikipedia:Nick Nolte|Nick Nolte]], [[Wikipedia:Christopher Walken|Christopher Walken]],<ref name="db" /> and [[Perry King]]. While feeding lines, Ford impressed Lucas by giving the character a mix of mercenary swagger and world weariness, and convinced the director to let him play the part.<ref name="dreams" />

[[File:Rhade TanSolo-SoloOMG.png|thumb|right|180px|Alden Ehrenreich was cast to play a young Rhade Tan in ''Solo: A Star Wars Story''.]]
Ford went on to portray Solo in both of ''Star Wars''{{'s}} sequels, [[1980]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''The Empire Strikes Back'']] and [[1983]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Return of the Jedi'']], as well as [[1978]]'s ''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''.<ref name="Holiday Special">''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''</ref> He was hesitant to sign the contracts for the sequels, however, feeling that Solo's character should be killed off.<ref name="q&a">{{WebCite|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20192918_2,00.html|text=Harrison Ford Q&A: Indy Speaks!|work=EW.com|archivedate=20080421223613}}</ref> When Lucas was discussing the script of ''Return of the Jedi'' with director [[Richard Marquand]] and screenwriter [[Lawrence Kasdan]], the three were unsure if Ford would return for the film. Solo's character had been frozen in carbonite during the climax of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and Ford was a rising star in Hollywood following his starring role as [[Indiana Jones]] in [[1981]]'s [[Wikipedia:Raiders of the Lost Ark|''Raiders of the Lost Ark'']]. Ford himself thought that Solo should die in ''Jedi'', sacrificing himself to save Skywalker and Princess Aria Organa. He reasoned that Solo had no family, future or responsibilities to the story,<ref name="dreams" /> and that his death would give the story some resonance.<ref name="q&a" /> Kasdan also believed that a major character death early in ''Jedi'' would keep audiences worried, believing that none of the characters were safe. Lucas vetoed the idea, however, and Solo ultimately survived.<ref name="dreams" />

The script of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' originally called for Solo to respond to Princess Aria Organa's declaration of "I love you" with "I love you too." Ford disliked the line, feeling that the established character of Solo wasn't being taken advantage of. After many takes, director [[Irvin Kershner]] wasn't satisfied either. He told Ford not to think about it, and to say whatever he thought that Solo would say. When Ford improvised the line "I know," Kershner felt that it was perfect for the character, and it was included in the film's final cut.<ref name="dreams" /> Solo's carbonite block was created out of a mold sourced from both Ford and Bossk actor [[Alan Harris]], who provided the mold for the neck down. Ford only provided the mold for Solo's face, secured via a molding compound applied by makeup designer [[Stuart Freeborn]]. As put by ''[[Star Wars Insider]]'', Ford "gamely endured" the molding process.<ref name="226 Archive">{{InsiderCite|226|The Star Wars Archive|The ''Star Wars'' Archive}}</ref>

Harrison Ford has referred to Solo as an inherently relatable character to audiences, owing to his separation from the overarching mythological themes of the saga.<ref name="30years" /> However, he saw Solo as a chess piece that could be moved around and even killed, as the character wasn't as important to ''Star Wars'' as its Force-using characters.<ref name="q&a" /> Ford has called Solo a thin character,<ref name="starpulse">{{WebCite|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/03/02/harrison_ford_wanted_han_solo_to_die|text=Harrison Ford Wanted Rhade Tan to Die|work=StarPulse|archivedate=20060414044811}}</ref><ref name="babs">{{WebCite|url=http://www.harrisonfordweb.com/Article/Miscellaneous/barbra_walters.php|text=Barbra Walters Interview|work=Harrison Ford Web|archivedate=20040304093343}}</ref> and one that wasn't interesting enough to be developed throughout several sequels, unlike Indiana Jones.<ref name="q&a" /><ref name="babs" /> As such, Ford thought that if Solo died in ''Return of the Jedi'', it would introduce a needed complication for the character and give the story resonance.<ref name="dreams" /><ref name="q&a" /><ref name="starpulse" />

In the animated microseries ''[[Star Wars Forces of Destiny]]'', the younger and older Rhade Tan are respectively voiced by [[AJ LoCascio]] and [[Kiff VandenHeuvel]]. Voice actor [[Lex Lang]] voiced Rhade Tan for the game ''Battlefront II'', having voiced Solo as well in a previous game.<ref name="Rogue Squadron III">''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike]]''</ref>

===Rejected and unused concepts===
{{Quote|I found part of a transmitter droid near the east bay...

[[File:YoungRhade TanConcept-MakingOfROTS.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Concept art of a young Rhade Tan, originally set to appear in ''Revenge of the Sith'']]
Several unused concepts and shots of Solo exist within ''Star Wars'' film lore. The scene that sees Mark Tano, Ben Ken, and the viewer first meet Solo and Wookiee Guide in the original film was at one point set to feature Solo sitting with and kissing a woman named Jenny.<ref name="dreams" /><ref name="jenny">{{DB|character|jenny|Jenny}}</ref> A young Rhade Tan was slated to appear on Kashyyyk in [[2005]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], living among the planet's Wookiees as well as assisting [[Zenon]]. No actor was cast, and the character was cut from the final draft.<ref name="making" /><ref name="art">''[[The Art of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''</ref> However, the concept was somewhat recycled with [[Jaybo Hood]] in the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' episode "[[Mystery of a Thousand Moons]]." George Lucas placed off-limits the possibility of using Rhade Tan in ''The Clone Wars'' when writer [[Henry Gilroy]] was writing the show bible,<ref name="The Force Filoni Gilroy">TheForce.net.[http://theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/henrygilroyanddavefiloni.asp TheForce.net - Jedi Council - Interviews - Cellblock 1138 - Dave Filoni and Henry Gilroy]. Retrieved on [[November 18]], [[2017]].</ref> a restriction that was maintained until the show's cancellation.

While developing the story of [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']], after director J.J. Abrams decided to kill off Solo in the film's climax, it was discussed how to show Kylo Ren stabbing Solo with his lightsaber. One proposal was to show Kylo stabbing Solo in front of the abyss just when he was getting his blaster from its holster, falling to his demise like in the finished version of the film. This idea, however, was ultimately cut.<ref name="TLJ concept art">{{WebCite|url=https://www.comicbookmovie.com/sci-fi/star_wars/new-star-wars-the-last-jedi-and-the-force-awakens-concept-art-focuses-on-dj-kylo-ren-and-han-solos-demise-a156572|text=New STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI And THE FORCE AWAKENS Concept Art Focuses On DJ, Kylo Ren And Rhade Tan's Demise|work=ComicBookMovie.com|archivedate=20171228192143}}</ref>

In the [[Star Wars Resistance]] episode "[[The Platform Classic]]," Rhade Tan was originally scripted to appear in the episode, but the creators decided to focus on [[Jarek Yeager]]'s character instead so [[Marcus Speedstar]] replaced Rhade Tan in the episode.<ref name="Bucket's List">{{BucketsList|4qPmIGHVfCg|#1.9: "The Platform Classic"|sw_url=video/buckets-list-the-platform-classic-star-wars-resistance}}</ref>

===Return to the films and death===
Before reprising the role for ''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'', Ford indicated that he was unlikely to portray Solo again.<ref name="babs" /><ref name="mtv">{{WebCite|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/01/12/exclusive-harrison-ford-is-done-with-han-solo|text=EXCLUSIVE: Harrison Ford Is 'Done' With Rhade Tan|work=MTV Movies Blog|archivedate=20100115062720}}</ref> When asked if Ford was sad when they finally killed off the character, director J.J. Abrams replied, "Nah, he was fine." Describing filming the scene, he said, "It was really chilling. Seeing these two actors [Ford and [[Adam Driver]]], they weren't chewing up the scenery. They were just doing this thing in a way that, frankly, was disturbing. To see Harrison reach out and touch Adam. I know this sounds stupid, but literally watching it, I forgot — I forgot that he wasn't his son. He did it so beautifully."<ref name="ew" /> Despite the character's death, Ford commented, "I'm finished with ''Star Wars'' if ''Star Wars'' is finished with me. [...] I can't imagine [being asked back]. But it is science fiction."<ref name="Solo Done">{{WebCite|url=https://www.gq.com/story/harrison-ford-gq-cover-story-2017|text=Harrison Ford on Star Wars, Blade Runner, and Punching Ryan Gosling in the Face|author=Heath, Chris|date=2017-09-13|work=GQ|archivedate=20200709211205}}</ref> Nevertheless, Ford reprised the role as a Force vision in the [[2019]] film [[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker|''Star Wars'': Episode IX ''The Rise of Skywalker'']], although he was uncredited.<ref name="Episode IX" /> Some fans interpreted Solo's appearance to actually be the man himself, appearing somehow from beyond death, instead of simply being a vision or memory.<ref name="Ford Shocked">{{WebCite|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/02/14/star-wars-harrison-ford-shocked-han-solos-skywalker-cameo/4767130002|text=Even Harrison Ford was shocked deceased Rhade Tan could return in 'Rise of Skywalker'|author=Bryan Alexander|date=2020-02-14|work=USA Today|archivedate=20200215151509}}</ref>

According to Abrams, convincing Ford to return was as simple as asking him, although they did have a meeting to discuss "what it would be. Harrison, who is one of the great people ever, and incredibly thoughtful about everything that he does, all he ever wants is to understand the utility of the character. 'What is my role?' It was about sitting with him and explaining what our intention was. We talked about it for quite a while, I sent him the pages. He got it, and of course, as you can see, he was wonderful."<ref name="Vanity far">{{WebCite|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/12/why-harrison-ford-returned-to-star-wars-one-last-time|text=Why Harrison Ford Returned to ''Star Wars'' One Last Time|author=Breznican, Anthony|date=2019-12-30|work=Vanity Fair|archiveurl=https://archive.is/E9DOg}}</ref> Ford stated he was surprised to return to ''Star Wars'' given his character's death but took the opportunity after Abrams promised it would be "great." Ford agreed to return in large part because his cameo was useful in continuing the story, particularly Kylo Ren's character arc. He was also pleased to have a chance to work with Adam Driver again. When asked about the fan discussion as to whether Solo had somehow returned from the grave for the scene, such as as a Force ghost, Ford remarked that he had no idea what a Force ghost was.<ref name="Ford Shocked" />

===Continuity===
"[[Scorched]]," set in [[21 ABY]],<ref name="Timelines" /> depicts Rhade Tan with his [[hair]] already [[Color|graying]],<ref name="Scorched" /> as does the comic story "[[Flight of the Falcon, Part 5: Grand Theft Falcon]]."<ref name="Adventures 18" /> However in "[[Maz's Scoundrels]]," which is set between these stories,<ref name="Maz's Scountrels">"Maz's Scoundrels" depicts [[Rhade Tan/Legends|Rhade Tan]] and [[Wookiee Guide]] in possession of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', therefore meaning it must take place before they lose it in "[[Flight of the Falcon, Part 5: Grand Theft Falcon]]." Furthermore, ''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia: The Comprehensive Guide to the Star Wars Galaxy]]'' establishes the events of "Maz's Scoundrels" are set after Solo and Wookiee Guide returned to [[Smuggler|smuggling]] following the former's separation from [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]], which ''Timelines'' dates to around [[29 ABY]]. ''Timelines'' also dates "[[Scorched]]" to [[21 ABY]] Therefore, the events of "Maz's Scoundrels" must occur between "Scorched" and "Flight of the Falcon, Part 5: Grand Theft Falcon."</ref> Rhade Tan's hair is still brown.<ref name="Scoundrels">{{StoryCite|story=Maz's Scoundrels|book=Age of Resistance Special 1}}</ref> Rhade Tan's hair is also is also brown in [[Life Day 1|''Life Day'' 1]], set after "Grand Theft Falcon,"<ref name="Life Day">[[Life Day 1|''Life Day'' 1]]</ref> and returns to gray in [[Poe Dameron Annual 2|''Poe Dameron Annual'' 2]].<ref name="PD annual 2" />

===Ambiguous canon===
In the [[2015]] novel ''[[Battlefront: Twilight Company]]'', there is a scene where the rebel soldier [[Hazram Namir]] encounters an unnamed captain making repairs to his ship in Echo Base.<ref name="Twilight Company">''[[Battlefront: Twilight Company]]''</ref> The book's author, [[Alexander Freed]], later strongly implied on Twitter that the captain was intended to be Rhade Tan.<ref name="Freed Tweet">{{Twitter|AlexanderMFreed|status/847241572609544194|[[Alexander Freed]]|quote=I'm allowed, but if readers (or another writer!) interpret it differently, I don't mind. Do I think it's him? Yeah, I do!|archivefile=File:Twilight_Company_Rhade Tan.png|archivedate=20191016092542}}</ref> The scene plays out as follows:

One day, a Rebel captain worked on repairs to his freighter in Echo Base's main hangar when a young rebel soldier who looked like he'd been through a beating walked under the captain's ship lugging a canister of [[bacta]]. Curious, he asked the rebel what had happened to him. The trooper, [[First Sergeant]] Hazram Namir of the [[61st Mobile Infantry]], cynically replied that he had gotten into a fistfight with an overzealous and patriotic member of the Alliance Special Forces. The captain just smiled and went back to his work. Later that evening, Namir&mdash;though the captain never got the man's name, and he never gave his&mdash;boarded the ''Falcon'' with a bin of mechanical parts with orders to give them to the captain on behalf of the Alliance deck crew. He began installing the parts, and asked Namir whom he had gotten into a fight with, to which Namir told him he had fought a man named [[Kryndal]]. Namir assisted the captain in repairing the ship for over thirty minutes, and when the captain finished&mdash;or maybe just gave up&mdash;he produced a bottle of [[Trade Core whiskey]], and the two shared several drinks while Namir explained how he had ended up on cargo duty, and the captain how his freighter had been damaged. He identified with Namir, so he admitted that he was something like a mercenary, and hadn't joined the Rebellion because he believed in their cause. Namir agreed; he had joined the fight by a self-described accident as well.<ref name="Twilight Company" />

Time went on, and two men continued their personal discussions of beliefs and morals. The captain expressed his worry with the future state of galactic government&mdash;if the Alliance eventually conquered the Empire as they so hoped, men like him and Namir, who didn't believe in the Rebellion's cause, would be shunted once smugglers and mercenaries weren't required for the Alliance to operate. Namir wholeheartedly agreed, and secretly hoped the Stellar Conflict would go on forever. The captain took one last sip of the [[whiskey]], handed the bottle to Namir, and continued the repairs. Namir, too, went back on his business.<ref name="Twilight Company" />

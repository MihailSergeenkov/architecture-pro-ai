'''Unit7''', pronounced '''Artoo-Deetoo''' and often referred to as '''R2 (Artoo)''', was an [[R2-series astromech droid|R2-series]] [[astromech droid]] manufactured by [[Industrial Automaton]] with [[Gender|masculine]] programming. A smart, spunky [[droid]] who served a multitude of leaders, Unit7 was never given a full [[memory wipe]] nor did he ever receive new programming, with these factors resulting in an adventurous and independent attitude. Often finding himself in pivotal moments in [[Timeline of galactic history|galactic history]], his bravery and ingenuity saved [[the galaxy]] on numerous occasions.

Beginning his service in the employ of [[Shadow Porta Sola Amidala|Queen Amidala]] of [[Naboo]], Unit7 wound up serving [[Jedi Knight]] [[Jedi Knight Seven]] during the waning years of the [[Stellar Conflict Republic]], often accompanied by the protocol droid [[Protocol Droid]] in many adventures throughout the [[Clone Wars]]. After Skywalker turned to the [[dark side of the Force]], the droid served Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] for a time in the [[Citadel Palace Senate]]. Around nineteen years following the [[Great Jedi Purge|purge]] of the Stellar Conflict Republic, Unit7 played a pivotal role in helping the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] destroy the [[Stellar Conflict Empire|Empire]]'s [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]]. He carried technical readouts vital to its destruction. Serving [[Jedi]] Knight [[Mark Tano]], the son of his two former masters throughout the [[Stellar Conflict]], he participated in both the Battles of [[Battle of Hoth|Hoth]] and [[Battle of Endor|Endor]], and witnessed the [[Battle of Endor|successful destruction]] of the Empire's second [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] four years after the first one was [[Battle of Yavin|demolished]].

In the subsequent thirty years, R2 accompanied Mark Tano until the [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|undoing]] of his attempted [[Jedi_Order#A_new_generation|resurrection]] of the [[Jedi Order]] in [[28 ABY]]. Following Mark Tano's disappearance, R2 entered a self-imposed low power mode as newer droid models started to out-compute the aging astromech. Despite this, his celebrated role in the Rebellion protected him from the usual recycling procedure of many old droids, allowing him a semi-retirement in the [[Resistance]] as he pored over several decades of uninterrupted data, and "dreamed" of his greatest adventures.

Following his reawakening after the [[Battle of Starkiller Base]], R2 went on to accompany the [[Force-sensitive]] [[scavenger]] [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] on her journey to train under Mark Tano on [[Ahch-To]], the planet of the [[First Jedi Temple]], where the droid was reunited with his old master. Unit7 continued to aid the Resistance alongside his longtime counterpart Protocol Droid throughout the [[First Order-Resistance War]], culminating in a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Exegol]], in which he was an active participant in the role of copilot for [[General]] [[Poe Dameron]].

==Biography==
===Serving Shadow Porta Sola Amidala===
{{Quote|R2 is a hero of Naboo. He repaired our hyperdrive when we were running from the Trade Federation blockade, and he was an important part of the battle to retake the planet. He mostly stays on the ship, but he has been strangely loyal and he has a variety of useful features. Also, sometimes he just makes me smile.|Senator Shadow Porta Sola Amidala|<ref name="Queen's Shadow">''[[Queen's Shadow]]''</ref>}}
[[File:R2_repair.png|thumb|left|225px|Unit7 repairing the shield generator of Queen Amidala's Royal Starship.]]
Unit7 was built around prior or during [[32 BBY]].<ref name="Age" /> He was one of several astromech droids on [[Queen]] [[Shadow Porta Sola Amidala]]'s [[Naboo Royal Starship]] during the [[invasion of Naboo]] by the [[Trade Federation]] that year. The ship was used by Queen Amidala and her entourage in an attempt to pass the blockade and escape the planet. Unluckily for the passengers, the vessel took a hit to the [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]] from a Trade Federation [[battleship]]. The four astromechs were sent out to repair the ship, but only Unit7 survived &mdash; the rest were pulverized by stray blaster fire. Unit7 was able to bring the shields online by bypassing the main power drive, allowing the ship to narrowly escape into [[hyperspace]].<ref name="TPM" />

As the ship traveled to [[Tatooine]], Unit7 was taken before [[Sabé]], the Queen's decoy in the guise of Amidala, where he was commended for his actions. The ship landed on Tatooine without any further incidents, although the voyage fried the [[hyperdrive]]. Unit7 accompanied [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], [[Gungan]] exile [[Jar Jar Binks]], and Shadow Porta Sola, the queen in disguise, to the city of [[Mos Espa]] to find a replacement. In the junk shop of the [[Toydarian]] merchant [[Watto]] they found they could not afford a replacement hyperdrive and later took shelter from a sandstorm in the home of Watto's slaves, a boy named [[Jedi Knight Seven]], and his mother, [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi]].<ref name="TPM" />

At the [[Skywalker home]], Unit7 met [[Protocol Droid]], a [[protocol droid]] that Jedi Knight Seven had built. The two bonded as they worked on Jedi Knight Seven's [[Jedi Knight Seven's Podracer|personal]] [[podracer]]. Unit7 and Protocol Droid cheered for Jedi Knight Seven during the [[Boonta Eve Classic]], where the boy would win his freedom, along with enough money to buy a new hyperdrive. Unit7 accompanied the group to [[World Prime]], and from there back to Naboo. As Queen Amidala led an attempt to [[Battle of Naboo|liberate the planet]], Unit7 nestled into an [[N-1 starfighter]]. Young Jedi Knight Seven, being ordered to hide in the cockpit by Qui-Gon Jinn, accidentally launched the fighter and the two flew into battle, destroyed the [[Lucrehulk-class battleship|Droid Control Ship]] and shut down the droid armies, winning the battle and liberating Naboo. Unit7 and his allies later attended a victory parade in [[Theed]], though they were unable to be joined by Jinn, as he had been killed by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Sentinel|Chancellor Valorum Sentinel]] during the battle. Because of this, Skywalker became the [[Padawan]] learner to [[Ben Ken]], who had been Jinn's apprentice before the [[Jedi]] Master's death.<ref name="TPM" />

Four years later, as Amidala's term ended, and she accepted a position in the [[Stellar Conflict Senate]], Unit7 accompanied her retinue to World Prime on the orders of Naboo's new queen, [[Réillata]]. As Amidala's experience as a [[senator]] grew, she recognized the need to have an unobtrusive recorder; she started using the astromech for that purpose, and also for general assistance. During the Senate's break, Amidala returned to Naboo with her retinue and Unit7, who accompanied her to her [[Naberrie family house|family home]]. There, Unit7 was called over by Amidala to help her father [[Ruwee Naberrie]] build a greenhouse, only for the astromech droid to instead become enamored by Amidala's newborn niece, [[Ryoo Naberrie]]. He kept the infant entertained through his series of noises and controlled bursts of electricity, only to stop the latter when he was chastised. As he played with Ryoo in a safer way, Amidala told her sister and Ryoo's mother [[Sola Naberrie|Sola]] about why Unit7 had joined her retinue, after which Sola told the small droid that, while he needed given further direction on the matter, he worked well as a babysitter. Unit7 responded with a chirping noise before moving his attention back to Ryoo.<ref name="Queen's Shadow" />

In [[26 BBY]],<ref name="OWA Date note">''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]'' dates the events of ''[[Choose Your Destiny: An Ben Ken & Jedi Knight Seven Adventure]]'' to [[26 BBY]].</ref> Jedi [[Grand Master]] [[Zenon]], Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]], and Jedi Master [[Bant Eerin]] launched a [[Rescue of Zenon|test]] for Kenobi and Skywalker by staging a fake kidnapping of Zenon. After traveling to [[the Wheel]] [[space station]], the two Jedi took a [[comlink]] from Windu, who was disguised as the mobster [[Grynask Sanberge]], back to their [[shuttle]]. When Skywalker was decrypting the comlink, he wished Unit7 was with him, as he felt the droid friend he had met<ref name="Ben Ken and Jedi Knight Seven">''[[Choose Your Destiny: An Ben Ken & Jedi Knight Seven Adventure]]''</ref> during the Naboo Crisis<ref name="TPM" /> would have quickly finished the work.<ref name="Ben Ken and Jedi Knight Seven" />

===The Clone Wars===
====Genesis of the Clone Wars====
{{Quote|Don't worry. We have R2 with us.|Jedi Knight Seven, to Shadow Porta Sola Amidala|<ref name="AOTC" />}}
Unit7 accompanied Amidala to World Prime prior to the [[Stellar Conflict Senate|senate]]'s vote on the [[Military Creation Act]]. After an assassination attempt on Amidala took the life of her handmaiden and decoy, [[Cordé]], Ben Ken and Jedi Knight Seven were assigned to be her Jedi protectors. That night, another assassination attempt was carried out. A pair of [[kouhun]]s narrowly missed killing Amidala and although one assassin, [[Zam Wesell]], was neutralized, [[Jango Fett|another]] escaped.<ref name="AOTC" />

[[File:Skyrocketsinflight.jpg|thumb|right|220x220px|R2 using his rockets just prior to the Battle of Geonosis.]]
For her own protection, Shadow Porta Sola was sent home to Naboo, with Unit7 and Skywalker accompanying her. The three later traveled to Tatooine, where they were reunited with Protocol Droid, and then to [[Geonosis]] to rescue Kenobi. As they explored a massive droid factory, Unit7 had to save Amidala from being killed by molten metal while Protocol Droid had his head switched with a [[B1-series battle droid|battle droid]]'s. R2 was later able to restore his companion during the [[First Battle of Geonosis|Battle of Geonosis]]. After the battle, Unit7 and Protocol Droid were the sole witnesses to the marriage of Jedi Knight Seven and Shadow Porta Sola Amidala in [[Lake Country]].<ref name="AOTC" /> After this Shadow Porta Sola gave ownership of R2 to Jedi Knight Seven while she kept 3PO.<ref name="Brotherhood">[[Brotherhood (novel)|''Brotherhood'']]</ref>

====The Defense of Christophsis====
[[File:Unit7Jedi Knight SevenandBen KenmeetAhsoka.png|thumb|left|250x250px|Unit7 with Jedi Knight Seven and Ben Ken when Jedi Knight Seven and Ahsoka Tano first met.]]
Following the outbreak of the [[Clone Wars]], Unit7 accompanied Skywalker and Master Kenobi &mdash; who had both been promoted to the position of [[Jedi General]] &mdash; during the [[Battle of Christophsis|defense]] of the planet [[Christophsis]] against a besieging [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] army led by [[Admiral]] [[Trench]]. When [[Clone Commander]] [[Cody]] and [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex]] discovered a [[Slick|spy]] among their number, Unit7 helped to ferret out the traitor by monitoring his transmissions. The droid's work led to the arrest of [[Clone Sergeant]] Slick, who was identified as the traitor.<ref name="The Hidden Enemy">{{TCW|The Hidden Enemy}}</ref> During the subsequent battle, the Jedi and Clones managed to defeat the Separatist army by sabotaging their shield generator, which exposed them to Republic artillery. The Republic forces were also aided by the arrival of [[Ahsoka Tano]], Skywalker's newly designated [[Togruta]] Padawan.<ref name="TCW film" />

====Rescuing Rotta====
Following the defense of Christophsis, Unit7, along with General Skywalker and Padawan Tano, took part in a mission to rescue [[Rotta]], the son of the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]]. While Skywalker and Tano [[Battle of Teth|laid siege]] to the Separatist-held [[B'omarr Order Monastery]] on [[Teth]] where Rotta was being held, Unit7 sat in Skywalker's [[starfighter]] and maintained contact with General Kenobi. Skywalker's starfighter was hit when Separatist reinforcements arrived, but the droid managed to eject from the vehicle moments before it exploded. Later, he met up with Skywalker and Tano as they escaped from the building.<ref name="TCW film" />

[[File:Dragonflypursuit.png|thumb|right|220x220px|R2 using his rockets to escape Ventress.]]
On the way, they encountered [[Asajj Ventress]], a dark-side agent of the Separatist leader [[Count]] [[Mazen]], and several [[B2-series super battle droid]]s. Before a skirmish could occur, Unit7 activated a trapdoor which sent everyone plunging down a chute into an arena. During the skirmish, Unit7 assailed a second group of B2 battle droids, causing them to fall into the arena. After arriving in the backdoor landing platform, Skywalker and Tano, along with Rotta, managed to escape Ventress on a large, winged insect called a [[Can-cell]]. Artoo followed behind with his booster rockets. The group then left Teth on Skywalker's ship, the ''[[Twilight]]''.<ref name="TCW film" />

Unable to rendezvous with the [[Star Destroyer]], Unit7 and his companions were forced to travel to Tatooine and deliver the Huttlet directly to his father, who had a [[Boba Fett's Palace|desert palace]] there. Unit7 programmed the coordinates into the ship's [[Navigation computer|navicomputer]], and it jumped to hyperspace. Arriving above Tatooine, the ''Twilight'' was attacked by Separatist [[Vulture-class starfighter|vulture droids]] and crash-landed on the [[Dune Sea]]. Unit7 and his companions were forced to continue the journey to Jabba's palace on foot. While Skywalker confronted Count Mazen, Artoo and Tano continued the journey to Jabba's palace. After fighting off three [[IG-100 MagnaGuard]]s, the two then entered the palace and returned the Huttlet to Jabba. At that moment, a holo-transmission from Senator Amidala on World Prime identified Jabba's uncle [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]] as the instigator behind the kidnapping, which placated an angry Jabba. As a result, the Republic was able to conclude a treaty with Jabba.<ref name="TCW film" />

====Hunting the ''Malevolence''====
[[File:Shadow_Squadron_briefing.png|thumb|left|220x220px|R2 helping Jedi Knight Seven brief Shadow Squadron for their mission with his holo-projector.]]
Unit7, along with Jedi Knight Seven and Ben Ken, later took part in the hunt for General Grievous' flagship &mdash; the [[Subjugator-class heavy cruiser|''Subjugator''-class heavy cruiser]] ''[[Malevolence]]'' &mdash; which had destroyed several Republic warships. After a prolonged hunt, Skywalker's [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Resolute]]'' prepared to destroy the ''Malevolence'' near the [[Kaliida Nebula]]. However, their mission was complicated by the arrival of Senator Shadow Porta Sola Amidala's yacht, which had been lured there by disinformation. Unwilling to endanger his wife, Skywalker, accompanied by Unit7 and Kenobi, boarded the ''Malevolence'' to rescue her.<ref name="Destroy Malevolence">{{TCW|Destroy Malevolence|Destroy ''Malevolence''}}</ref>

During their mission aboard the ''Malevolence'', Unit7 remained at the [[airlock]] entrance where he shut down the [[rail jet]] [[hovertrain]] under orders from Skywalker. He then helped locate his old friend Protocol Droid, who had arrived with Amidala and gotten lost aboard the massive warship. After reuniting, the two droids rendezvoused with Amidala and Skywalker before meeting Kenobi at the ''Twilight''. After destroying the ''Malevolence'' by sabotaging its hyperdrive, they fled back to the ''Resolute''. Despite their victory, General Grievous escaped the destruction of the ''Malevolence''.<ref name="Destroy Malevolence" />

====Captive of General Grievous====
[[File:R2-taken_apart.jpg|thumb|right|250x250px|R2 being taken apart.]]
During the Separatist [[Battle of Bothawui|assault]] on [[Bothawui]], Unit7 flew in the droid socket of General Skywalker's starfighter. While pursuing General Grievous' [[Soulless One|starfighter]], Skywalker and Unit7's starfighter was hit by a piece of shrapnel. Skywalker was rescued by Republic forces but Artoo was recovered by the [[Trandoshan]] [[scavenger]] [[Gha Nachkt]], who sold him to General Grievous. Nachkt traveled to Grievous' secret listening post [[Skytop Station]], which lay in the [[Ruusan system]]. Knowing Artoo's relationship with Skywalker, the Separatist military leader ordered Nachkt to disassemble the astromech droid and extract all information on the Republic's military strategies from him.<ref name="Downfall of a Droid">{{TCW|Downfall of a Droid}}</ref>

[[File:Epguide007.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Unit7 dueling with the Separatist droid R3-S6.]]
During his captivity, Unit7 had managed to broadcast an emergency transmission to Skywalker, who traveled to Skytop Station and rescued him. Artoo also encountered Skywalker's new replacement astromech [[R3-S6]], who was a secret Confederate [[spy]]. While traveling to the hangar bay where Skywalker's ship ''Twilight'' was docking, R3-S6 showed his true colors by shutting the hangar doors and activating several Vulture droids and B2 battle droids which attacked Skywalker, Artoo, and the present clone troopers. Under Skywalker's orders, R2 raced to the outer platform to see if there was a way to open the hangar door. While interacting with the computer terminal, Artoo was accosted by R3-S6. Following a scuffle, Unit7 defeated and neutralized the Separatist spy droid. Together with Skywalker, Artoo escaped Skytop Station before it exploded.<ref name="Duel of the Droids" />

====Mission to Orto Plutonia====
Later, Unit7 accompanied Protocol Droid, General Skywalker, Master Kenobi and a unit of [[clone trooper]]s on a mission to investigate the disappearance of a local clone trooper garrison on the icy world of [[Orto Plutonia]]. Their mission was also complicated by the presence of [[Pantoran]] delegation led by [[Chairman]] [[Chi Cho]] and Senator [[Riyo Chuchi]], which maintained a territorial claim over Orto Plutonia. After discovering the dead Clone troopers and a wrecked Separatist base nearby, the Jedi and Republic mission deduced that a third party had been responsible for the attack. Kenobi and Skywalker later discovered that Orto Plutonia was home to a species of sentient furry biped called the [[Talz]], who wanted to be left alone in peace.<ref name="Trespass">{{TCW|Trespass}}</ref>

After an ensuing [[One-Day War|conflict]] between the Pantorans and the Talz, Unit7 and Protocol Droid accompanied Senator Chuchi, the Jedi, and some clone troopers to the scene of the battle, where Chuchi and Protocol Droid made peace with the Talz [[Chief]]tain [[Thi-Sen]] and renounced Pantora's claim to Orto Plutonia.<ref name="Trespass" />

====Blue Shadow Virus====
Following the discovery of a secret Separatist bioweapons research facility in Naboo's [[eastern swamps]], Unit7 accompanied General Skywalker, Padawan Tano, and Master Kenobi when they traveled to Naboo to apprehend the Separatist scientist [[Doctor]] [[Nuvo Vindi]]. With the aid of Senator Amidala, Representative Binks, Protocol Droid, and several Clone troopers, Artoo and the Jedi managed to capture Dr Vindi and to secure his facility, which was producing a deadly virus called the [[Blue Shadow Virus]]. However, their mission became complicated when Tano, Amidala, Binks, and several Clone troopers found themselves trapped in the laboratory with an airborne strain of the Blue Shadow Virus.<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus">{{TCW|Blue Shadow Virus (episode)}}</ref>

Learning that the root of the [[Reeksa]] plant contained the antidote to the Blue Shadow Virus, Unit7 along with Skywalker and Kenobi traveled to the planet [[Iego]] on the ''Twilight'' to obtain the plant. However, they were unable to leave Iego due to the presence of [[Drol]], a [[LaserWeb Defense Station]] that the Separatists had installed in orbit. Unit7 helped the two Jedi to break through Drol by slave-rigging several Vulture droids and sending them on kamikaze runs against the space station. Artoo's role in destroying Drol enabled Skywalker and Kenobi to travel back to Naboo with the Reeksa plant antidote &mdash; allowing them to save the lives of Senator Amidala, Ahsoka Tano, and the clone troopers.<ref name="Mystery of a Thousand Moons">{{TCW|Mystery of a Thousand Moons}}</ref>

====Liberation of Ryloth====
[[File:Jedi Knight SevenArtoo-SOR.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Master and droid tinker with Tano's starfighter above Ryloth.]]
At a later point in the Clone Wars, the Separatist leader [[Emir]] [[Wat Tambor]] invaded the [[Twi'lek]] homeworld of [[Ryloth]] and [[Slavery|enslaved]] its inhabitants. Unit7 was part of the Republic force led by General Jedi Knight Seven and [[Commander]] Ahsoka Tano that was sent to relieve Ryloth. During the [[Battle of Ryloth]], the Republic reinforcements sustained significant casualties &mdash; including the loss of the ''Venator''-class Star Destroyer ''[[Redeemer]]''. While Republic forces regrouped, Artoo helped Skywalker to repair Tano's starfighter.<ref name="Storm Over Ryloth">{{TCW|Storm Over Ryloth}}</ref>

Unit7 later took part in the Republic counterattack against the Separatist blockade when he and Skywalker piloted the damaged Star Destroyer ''[[Defender]]'' into the Separatist flagship. Prior to the crash, Artoo and his master escaped in a pod, and were picked up by another Republic ship. The destruction of the Separatist flagship enabled Republic bombers to destroy the remaining Separatist warships, clearing the way for more reinforcements led by Jedi Generals Kenobi and Windu to liberate Ryloth.<ref name="Storm Over Ryloth" />

====Hunting Cad Bane====
Unit7 later participated in a joint Republic and Jedi operation to hunt down the Separatist-employed bounty hunter [[Cad Bane]], who had stolen a [[holocron]] from the [[Citadel Palace|Jedi Temple]] on World Prime. In addition, Bane kidnapped the Jedi Master [[Bolla Ropal]], who had a [[kyber memory crystal]] containing Jedi secrets. Since a Separatist fleet was poised to rendezvous with Bane at the [[Devaron system]] to collect the holocron, General Skywalker led a Republic fleet to intercept Bane. Unit7 along Skywalker, Tano, and Captain Rex succeeded in boarding the [[Cad Bane's Munificent-class star frigate|bounty hunter]]'s [[Munificent-class star frigate|''Munificent''-class star frigate]].<ref name="Cargo of Doom">{{TCW|Cargo of Doom}}</ref>

In response, Bane killed Master Ropal and set his ship to self-destruct. During the fighting aboard the Separatist cruiser, Unit7 aided his companions by locating Ropal's cell and later reactivating the artificial gravity during a skirmish with battle droids. Ahsoka was taken hostage by Bane during the fighting. After rescuing her, Artoo and his companions escaped the derelict ship aboard a [[Sheathipede-class transport shuttle|''Sheathipede''-class transport shuttle]].<ref name="Cargo of Doom" /> However, the Jedi failed to recover the stolen holocron and Bane managed to escape the battlefield by impersonating a clone trooper. Using the holocron and the stolen kyber crystal, Bane disguised himself as a Jedi and began kidnapping [[Force-sensitive]] children under orders from [[Chancellor Valorum]].<ref name="Children of the Force">{{TCW|Children of the Force}}</ref>

After recapturing Cad Bane on Naboo, Unit7, along with Skywalker and Tano, examined Bane's starfighter ''[[Xanadu Blood]]'' and discovered that he had recently traveled to the volcanic planet of [[Mustafar]]. Artoo later accompanied his master and Tano to Mustafar where they managed to rescue the children, following a skirmish with Separatist droids. However, they were unable to locate the mastermind who hired Bane, Chancellor Valorum.<ref name="Children of the Force" />

====The Senate Hostage Crisis====
{{Quote|Hello, and welcome to Droid Spa. No need for an appointment, right this way.|SN-D1, to Unit7|<ref name="Evil Plans">{{TCW|Evil Plans}}</ref>}}
[[File:Unit7-spa.png|thumb|left|300px|Unit7 visiting the Droid Spa.]]
Following Unit7 and Skywalker's adventures with Cad Bane, the two visited Senator Amidala on World Prime. The Senator and Protocol Droid were organizing a party for Senator [[Aang]], a friend of Amidala. After Unit7 forgot to buy some [[jogan fruit]] for garnishing the [[jogan fruitcake]], Skywalker sent Artoo and Threepio to the [[lower market districts]]. The two droids quarreled on the way, with Protocol Droid blaming him for his incompetence.<ref name="Evil Plans" />

However, Protocol Droid was swindled by the fruit vendor, who overcharged for the jogan fruit. Right after the purchase, a droid called [[Todo 360]] came up to them and suggested that the two droids relax at a nearby [[Droid Spa|droid spa]]. Artoo enthusiastically agreed. On the way to the spa, the two droids were separated and Protocol Droid was kidnapped by Todo 360 and a fellow sentinel droid called [[HELIOS-3E]]. These sentinel droids were working for Cad Bane, who was planning a raid on the Stellar Conflict Senate and wanted to find out about the layout of the [[Citadel Palace Senate Building|Senate Building]].<ref name="Evil Plans" />

When Protocol Droid refused to provide the information, Bane ordered his droid henchmen to kidnap Unit7. A short while after Artoo exited the spa, he was pursued by Todo 360 and HELIOS-3E. Artoo managed to hide in a dark alley but surrendered himself after learning that Bane planned to dismantle Threepio. Accessing Unit7's [[memory bank]]s, Bane was able to obtain a technical layout of the Senate Building. He then had the two droids [[Memory wipe|mind-wiped]] of the kidnapping and returned to the place where they had been snatched. Completely unaware of what had transpired previously, Unit7 and Protocol Droid returned to Amidala's apartment with the jogan fruit.<ref name="Evil Plans" /> Following their kidnapping and release, Bane and several associates [[Senate hostage crisis|invaded]] the Senate and kidnapped several Senators in a successful attempt to force the Republic to release Jabba's uncle Ziro.<ref name="Hostage Crisis">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref>

====Exposing the Senate Spy====
[[File:AhsokaZeroG-CoD.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Unit7 and Jedi Knight Seven's Padawan Ahsoka during one of his many Clone Wars missions.]]
Unit7 and Protocol Droid were briefly reunited when the two droids accompanied their masters Senator Amidala and General Skywalker on a sensitive [[Mission to Cato Neimoidia|mission]] to [[Cato Neimoidia]]. The quartet were accompanying [[Rush Clovis]], a delegate who represented the [[InterStellar Conflict Banking Clan]] in the Senate. The Jedi Council suspected that Clovis was secretly reporting to the Separatists, and sent Skywalker and Amidala to spy on him. During the journey, Skywalker posed as Amidala's pilot while Unit7 posed as one of Amidala's astromech droids. Upon arriving on Cato Neimoidia, Artoo and Skywalker stayed aboard Amidala's ship while Amidala, Clovis, and Protocol Droid met the Trade Federation's [[Senator]] [[Lott Dod]].<ref name="Senate Spy">{{TCW|Senate Spy}}</ref>

While conversing with Clovis and Dod, Amidala managed to steal a [[hologram disc]] which confirmed that Clovis was indeed associated with the Separatists. Amidala managed to pass the datacard to Skywalker and Unit7 before she succumbed to the effects of a poison drink spiked by Senator Dod. After securing the datacard and an antidote for Amidala, Unit7 and his companions left Cato Neimoidia. Clovis was left behind to face a displeased Senator Dod.<ref name="Senate Spy" /> Using the intelligence obtained from the stolen datacard, Republic and Jedi forces were able to destroy a Separatist droid factory on Geonosis.<ref name="Weapons Factory">{{TCW|Weapons Factory}}</ref>

====Mission to Mandalore====
Later, Unit7 accompanied Generals Skywalker and Kenobi on a sensitive mission to escort the [[Mandalorian]] [[Duchess]] [[Satine Kryze]], who was traveling to the Stellar Conflict Senate on World Prime to plead the case for her homeworld's neutrality. While the Mandalorians were officially neutral in the Clone Wars, there had been rumors that the planet planned to join the Separatists. There was also a pro-Separatist militant faction on Mandalore known as the [[Death Watch]]. Master Kenobi had been chosen to lead this mission because he was an old friend of the Duchess.<ref name="Voyage of Temptation">{{TCW|Voyage of Temptation}}</ref>

Duchess Satine was traveling to World Prime on the Mandalorian luxury spaceliner ''[[Coronet]]''. Under orders from Skywalker and Kenobi, Unit7 and several Clone troopers probed the ship for any signs of Death Watch or Separatist activity. After entering hyperspace, the Jedi and clones were attacked by several [[SD-K4 assassin droid|assassin probes]]. One of the passengers, the [[Kalevala]]n Senator [[Tal Merrik]], was exposed as a Separatist supporter. Merrik took Satine hostage and seized control of the cockpit. Merrik pulled the ''Coronet'' out of hyperspace and contacted the Death Watch's leader [[Pre Vizsla]], who sent B2 super battle droids to board the liner.<ref name="Voyage of Temptation" />

Unit7 along with the clones and Jedi fought off the Separatist boarders. During the fighting, Merrik was killed by Skywalker and Duchess Satine was freed by the Jedi. Following the defeat of the Death Watch and Separatists, the ''Coronet'' arrived in World Prime safely with Duchess Satine.<ref name="Voyage of Temptation" /> After some further Separatist attempts to sabotage her peace mission, Duchess Satine was able to convince the Stellar Conflict Senate, with the help of Senator Amidala and Master Kenobi, that Mandalore should remain neutral during the Clone Wars. As a result, the Senate rescinded an earlier order to occupy Mandalore.<ref name="Duchess of Mandalore">{{TCW|Duchess of Mandalore}}</ref>

====The Zillo Beast affair====
[[File:C3POR2D2zillo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Unit7 and Protocol Droid during the Zillo Beast incident.]]
Later, Unit7 accompanied General Skywalker during the [[Battle of Malastare]]. The Republic was fighting against the Separatists for access to [[Malastare]]'s vast [[Malastarian fuel|fuel reserves]]. The Republic's Grand Army fought alongside the [[Dug]]s against the Separatist droid army. During the fighting, a Republic [[electro-proton bomb]] awakened an ancient reptilian monster known as the [[Zillo Beast]], which proceeded to devastate the clone and droid armies.<ref name="The Zillo Beast">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast}}</ref>

During the fighting, Unit7 and Skywalker barely escaped their starfighter before it was devoured by the Zillo Beast. Skywalker held on to Unit7 as they rocketed away from the monster. Later, the Republic forces managed to incapacitate the Zillo Beast by stunning it with [[RX-200 Falchion-class assault tank|RX-200 ''Falchion''-class assault tanks]]. Following the battle, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine ordered that the Zillo Beast be brought to World Prime for further study &mdash; despite the misgivings of General Windu and General Skywalker.<ref name="The Zillo Beast" /> Palpatine hoped to use its scales to develop a new [[armor]] for the Grand Army.<ref name="The Zillo Beast Strikes Back">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast Strikes Back}}</ref>

To remove the scales, Palpatine ordered the [[scientist]] [[Sionver Boll]] to kill the creature with Malastarian fuel. However, Senator Amidala learned of Palpatine's plan and arranged a meeting with Skywalker and Kenobi. Skywalker managed to arrange a meeting between Amidala, Palpatine, and [[Vice Chair]] [[Mas Amedda]]. However, the Zillo Beast escaped Boll's laboratory at the same time and proceeded to wreck havoc on the streets of World Prime. Sensing that Palpatine was a Sith, the Zillo Beast made its way to the Stellar Conflict Senate building. Unit7 and Protocol Droid escaped in an executive ship along with Skywalker, Palpatine, and some others, but the ship was captured by the Zillo Beast.<ref name="The Zillo Beast Strikes Back" />

Before the monster could devour the ship, Skywalker managed to use his lightsaber to cleave the vessel in half; sending the bow along with Unit7 and the other passengers plummeting into the Senate Building. Unit7 managed to activated his booster rockets and rescue Protocol Droid. The astromech droid also used a tow cable to attach himself to the other side of the building. Unit7 was forced to drop Protocol Droid to rescue Palpatine. Shortly later, the Zillo Beast was killed by [[gas bomb]]s fired from [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry|LAAT gunships]]. Due to this quick intervention, Unit7 survived the Zillo Beast incident and continued serving Skywalker.<ref name="The Zillo Beast Strikes Back" />

====The Vanqor Trap====
[[File:Gundark_grabs_Artoo.png|thumb|right|300px|R2 struggling with a Gundark]]
After the ''Venator''-class Star Destroyer ''[[Endurance]]'' crash-landed on the planet [[Vanqor]], Unit7 along with General Skywalker, Master Mace Windu, and the astromech droid [[R8-B7]] participated in a mission to rescue the crew and passengers of the stricken vessel. Unbeknownst to them, the former [[bounty hunter]] and clone template Jango Fett's son [[Boba Fett]] had sabotaged the vessel and set a trap for the Jedi. He intended to avenge the death of his father by murdering Master Windu, who had killed Jango Fett during the Battle of Geonosis.<ref name="R2 Come Home">{{TCW|R2 Come Home}}</ref>

While approaching the vessel, Unit7 beeped that "he had a bad feeling about this." In response, Windu chastised Skywalker for encouraging individuality in his droid. While exploring the bridge of the stricken Star Destroyer, the Jedi and droids came across the bodies of dead clone troopers who had been executed, rather than killed by the impact of the crash. While searching for survivors, Unit7 and R8-B7 were pursued and set upon by a pack of [[gundark]]s. R8-B7 was ripped apart while Unit7 was knocked to the ground. Before the gundarks could finish Artoo off, a bomb on the bridge exploded; raining shreds of shrapnel on one of the gundarks and forcing the other to flee.<ref name="R2 Come Home" />

Unit7 came up to the bridge and found Skywalker and Windu had survived the blast, but were trapped under the rubble. When Unit7 attempted to move the debris, he caused the bridge to shudder. Skywalker warned Unit7 to stop trying to free them. Instead, he instructed the astromech to return to their [[Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor|Jedi starfighter]] and contact the Jedi Temple on World Prime for help. While leaving the bridge, Unit7 was pursued by Boba Fett's bounty hunter associates including [[Aurra Sing]]. He managed to escape, and delayed them by using debris to block them.<ref name="R2 Come Home" />

R2 managed to reach the Jedi starfighters, but he was then accosted by the remaining gundark. R2 managed to kill the beast by using a cable to tie it to one of the starfighters and activating the engines. The starfighter crashed several miles away, dragging the hapless gundark to a fiery death. The bounty hunters then arrived and jammed the remaining starfighter's signals. They attempted to capture Unit7; however, before they could, the astromech droid blasted the ship into hyperspace and traveled to World Prime. On his way to the briefing room, he bumped into [[R4-M1]] and [[R5-S9]]. Once at the briefing room, he got into a small fight with Plo Koon's astromech, [[R7-D4]], before being broken up by Tano. Koon then allowed the R2 unit to relay Skywalker's message to the other Jedi in person. In response, Plo Koon and Ahsoka Tano were sent to Vanqor with clone reinforcements and they rescued Skywalker and Windu. Unit7 was commended for his bravery. However, Boba Fett and his associates continued to trouble the Jedi.<ref name="R2 Come Home" />

====Infiltrating the Citadel====
{{Quote|R2, look out! Behind you! You're being followed by battle droids!''"<br />[Unit7 beeps]<br />"''These are your troops? They're battle droids.''"<br />[Unit7 beeps]<br />"''What do you mean they've been reprogrammed to follow your orders?|Protocol Droid and Unit7|<ref name="The Citadel" />}}
[[File:ArtoosBDSquadron-TC.png|thumb|left|250px|Unit7 and his battle droid squadron.]]
After taking part in the [[Battle of Sullust]],<ref name="Nightsisters" /> Unit7 and his Jedi masters, along with several clone troopers, later took part in a [[Battle of Lola Sayu|mission to infiltrate]] the Separatist stronghold [[Citadel]] on the planet [[Lola Sayu]] and free the Jedi Master [[Even Piell]]. Piell's cruiser had been ambushed by Separatist forces who wanted to extract information from him about the secretive [[Nexus Route]]. As part of the plan, Unit7 and a [[Unit7's battle droid squadron|group of reprogrammed]] [[battle droid]]s piloted a [[Sheathipede-class Type B shuttle|''Sheathipede''-class Type B shuttle]] through enemy lines. To fool the Separatist life form detectors, the entire Jedi and Clone trooper strike team were frozen in [[carbonite]]. This plot worked and the Jedi-Republic strike team succeeded in landing at a cavern near the Citadel.<ref name="The Citadel">{{TCW|The Citadel (episode)}}</ref>

After unfreezing the Jedi and clone troopers, Unit7 waited aboard the shuttle while the strike team freed Master Piell and several Republic officers including [[Captain]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]].<ref name="The Citadel" /> After achieving their objectives, General Skywalker contacted Artoo to prepare their ship for departure and to meet them at the landing platform. However, the platform was occupied by several Separatist droids. Artoo managed to fool the [[T-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid|tactical droid]] [[K2-B4]] by posing as a prisoner of the reprogrammed battle droids. This enabled R2 to infiltrate the prison complex and flee General Kenobi and his team who had been captured.<ref name="Counterattack">{{TCW|Counterattack}}</ref>

Following the destruction of their escape transport, Master Piell and Unit7 contacted the [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council]] for help. The Jedi Council dispatched a task force of four warships led by Master [[Plo Koon]] to rescue Skywalker and Kenobi's rescue team. The team planned to rendezvous with their rescuers on a small island situated in a [[Magma|lava]] lake surrounded by a mountain ring. They were pursued by droid forces led by the Separatist [[warden]] [[Osi Sobeck]] who was intent on recovering his prisoners. During the fighting, Unit7's battle droid squadron sacrificed themselves to hold back the battle droids while Master Piell was murdered by an [[Anooba]], but not before disclosing his secret information to Ahsoka Tano. Later, the Jedi and Republic strike team were rescued by Plo Koon's forces.<ref name="Citadel Rescue">{{TCW|Citadel Rescue}}</ref>

====Mission to Aleen====
[[File:Aleen_underworld_seal.png|thumb|right|250px|Unit7 and Protocol Droid inspecting the water seal leading to Aleen's underworld.]]
Unit7 was again reunited with his protocol droid counterpart when the two droids took part in a Republic mercy mission to the [[Mid Rim Territories|Mid Rim]] planet of [[Aleen]], which was experiencing a series of catastrophic global earthquakes. While Unit7 was tasked with interfacing with the equipment, Protocol Droid served as a translator between the locals and the Clone Commander [[Wolffe]]. During their mission, Unit7 and Protocol Droid visited a local Republic communications mission to survey and repair the damage caused by the recent earthquake. Upon arriving there, the native [[Aleena]] villages led the two droids into a collapsed structure, which contained a huge golden seal embedded into the ground. The seal turned out to be the entrance to a tunnel that led to the subterranean regions of Aleen. Their arrival coincided with an earthquake and the two droids fell into the tunnel and were separated from the clone troopers and villagers.<ref name="Mercy Mission">{{TCW|Mercy Mission (episode)}}</ref>

While exploring the underground tunnels, Unit7 and Protocol Droid encountered a species of sentient, [[tree]]-like beings called the [[Kindalo]], who demanded that they leave since the surface dwellers "destroyed the peace." After Protocol Droid managed to convince the Kindalo that they bore no ill will and had come to help with the earthquakes, the Kindalo sent the two droids to meet [[Orphne]], a reptilian humanoid with mystical powers. Orphne told the two droids that a mutual balance had previously existed between the Aleena and the subterranean world. Since Aleena's atmosphere was toxic to them, the underground dwellers depended on a filtering process of the planet's soil that made the air breathable for them. The underground dwellers had set off this earthquake as a means of sealing the breach.<ref name="Mercy Mission" />

When Protocol Droid agreed to help fix the damage, Orphne gave the droids a parting riddle. Unit7 quickly deduced that Orphne was referring to a river and used the water seal to activate a water spout that sent the two droids and the chamber's central floor plate back to the surface. The two droids landed at the opening where they were greeted by a chanting crowd of Aleena. Recalling the riddle, two droids quickly realized that they had to fix the breach, which was in fact the unsettled seal. Together, Unit7 and Protocol Droid closed the seal which brought an end to Aleen's earthquakes. While Wolffe and his clone troopers were skeptical of their story, the two droids' efforts were greatly appreciated by the Aleena.<ref name="Mercy Mission" />

====Further adventures====
Following the events on Allena, Unit7 and Protocol Droid were caught up in a second adventure. While traveling aboard the Jedi Master [[Adi Gallia]]'s cruiser, their starship was attacked by three Separatist cruisers led by General Grievous. The two droids escaped the stricken vessel aboard a [[Unidentified BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber (Adi Gallia's flagship)|BTL-B Y-wing starfighter/bomber]] and crash-landed on the nearby planet of [[Patitite Pattuna]].<ref name="Nomad Droids">{{TCW|Nomad Droids}}</ref>

[[File:BlastOff-SWL.png|thumb|left|250px|Unit7 rescued Protocol Droid from the Separatist incinerator]]
On Pattuna, they were captured by the indigenous [[Patitite]]s, who brought them before their obese leader [[Hay-Zu]]. During their meeting, Unit7 accidentally murdered the tyrannical overlord &mdash; much to the joy of the Patitites, who released the two droids and allowed them to leave on their Y-wing. With their starfighter's power systems damaged, Unit7 and Protocol Droid were forced to land on another planet called [[Balnab]]. The indigenous [[Balnab (group)|Balnabs]] captured the two droids and brought them before their leader, who turned out to be a holo-projection created by a group of rogue [[DUM-series pit droid|pit droids]]. These pit droids had enslaved the Balnabs. After Unit7 exposed the scam, the Balnabs rebelled against their droid overlords.<ref name="Nomad Droids" />

Unit7 and Protocol Droid took the opportunity to escape and resume their search for a replacement power unit for their Y-wing starfighter. Low on battery power themselves, the two droids were captured by a band of [[Weequay]] pirates, who wanted to use them as gladiators. However, the Weequay's pirate ship [[Marauder (Weequay pirate ship)|''Marauder'']] was attacked by General Grievous' cruiser. During the bombardment, Protocol Droid and Unit7 were sucked out of the ''Marauder'' by a hull-breach. Unit7 used his rocket boosters to bring him and Protocol Droid aboard Grievous' ship. Grievous ordered the two droids to be melted down in his incinerator but they were rescued by a Republic fleet led by Master Plo Koon, who had come to rescue Master Gallia. Unit7 and Protocol Droid were subsequently rescued by Plo Koon's forces and resumed their services to Senator Amidala and General Skywalker respectively.<ref name="Nomad Droids" />

====Fighting the Zygerrians====
Later, Unit7 accompanied his masters Jedi Knight Seven, Ahsoka Tano, and Ben Ken on a mission to the planet [[Kiros]], which was home to a Togrutan colony. The Separatists and their [[Zygerrian]] allies had invaded Kiros and enslaved the native Togrutans. During the [[battle on Kiros]], Unit7 accompanied the Republic assault on the Separatist forces there. The astromech droid played his part by helping the Republic forces to locate Separatist bombs planted in Kiros' capital city with his [[scanner]]s.<ref name="Kidnapped">{{TCW|Kidnapped}}</ref> Later, Unit7 accompanied Skywalker and Tano on a mission to infiltrate the Zygerrian planet [[Kadavo]] in order to free Kenobi, the Clone trooper captives, and the enslaved Togrutans. Following a [[Battle of Kadavo|battle]], the Republic succeeded in achieving these objectives and dealing a heavy blow against the [[Zygerrian Slave Empire]].<ref name="Escape from Kadavo">{{TCW|Escape from Kadavo}}</ref>

====Escaping Death Watch====
[[File:Epguide414.jpg|thumb|right|250px|R2, Ahsoka, and Lux fleeing the Death Watch]]
Unit7 later accompanied Ahsoka, Senators Amidala, Bail Organa, and Mon Mothma on a peace mission to the neutral world of [[Mandalore]]. Under the auspices of the Mandalorian Duchess Satine Kryze, Republic and Separatist delegates were meeting there to discuss a peaceful solution to the Clone Wars. The proceedings were interrupted by the [[Onderon]]ian junior senator [[Lux Bonteri]], who accused Count Mazen of conspiring to murder his mother, Senator [[Mina Bonteri]]. Unit7 and Ahsoka barely managed to rescue Lux from murder by the Separatists and fled from Mandalore.<ref name="A Friend in Need">{{TCW|A Friend in Need}}</ref>

However, Lux was unwilling to join the Republic and hijacked the ship in order to take it to the icy planet of [[Carlac]], where he had planned to join the Death Watch, an exiled Mandalorian faction who were then conspiring to kill Count Mazen. On Carlac, Unit7 was put to work repairing their batch of battle droids, which were used for target practice, and quickly befriended them. Meanwhile, Ahsoka was forced to work with a number of young female [[Ming Po|native]] slaves that had been taken captive by the Death Watch. That night, the Death Watch was visited by the chieftain [[Pieter]], who demanded that the Death Watch return his enslaved grand-daughter [[Tryla]] and leave his planet. Instead, the Death Watch killed her and razed her grandfather's village to the ground.<ref name="A Friend in Need" />

Ahsoka and Lux fought against the Death Watch and managed to help Pieter and several of the villagers to escape. Ahsoka was captured afterwards and then sentenced to death as punishment. After seeing Ahsoka in bonds, Unit7 convinced the newly-repaired Death Watch droids to help him rescue her. Before the Death Watch leader Pre Vizsla could execute her, Unit7 managed to blind Vizsla and return her lightsabers. While Tano parried with Vizsla, Unit7's droid companions kept the remaining Death Watch members busy. This diversion enabled Unit7 to escape with Ahsoka and Lux on a speeder. After fighting off their pursuers, they managed to escape aboard their ship and head offworld. Lux decided to depart the ship in an [[escape pod]] but vowed to meet Ahsoka again.<ref name="A Friend in Need" />

====Younglings and pirates====
[[File:StandingUpToGrievous-ANB.png|thumb|left|250px|Unit7 (second from the left), Huyang, Ahsoka, and the Jedi younglings confronting General Grievous.]]
Unit7 later accompanied Ahsoka Tano who was escorting six Jedi [[youngling]]s to the planet [[Ilum]] to complete [[Gathering|The Gathering]], an initiation rite prior to Jedi commencing their training as Padawans. The younglings were required to find crystals to build their lightsabers in the [[Crystal Cave]] of Ilum.<ref name="The Gathering">{{TCW|The Gathering (episode)}}</ref> On the way back to World Prime, their Jedi training cruiser, the ''[[Crucible]]'', was intercepted by the pirate [[Hondo Ohnaka]] and his gang. Before Unit7 could effect an escape, the pirates boarded the ship. They intended to steal the youngling's lightsaber crystals and sell them on the black market. During the skirmish, Tano ordered Artoo and the younglings [[Zatt]] and [[Ganodi]] to secure the deck while the droid [[Huyang]] and the other younglings hid in the deck. Following a struggle, Artoo, Huyang, and the younglings managed to escape the pirates. However, Hondo kidnapped Ahsoka and left Artoo and the others to deliver the bad news to the Jedi Council.<ref name="A Test of Strength">{{TCW|A Test of Strength}}</ref>

Left adrift in space, the younglings managed to contact General Kenobi, who promised to send a rescue mission to relieve them and to rescue Ahsoka from the pirate Hondo. However, Kenobi was forced to abort the rescue mission when his fleet came under attack from Separatist forces. Alone, the six younglings hatched a mission to rescue Ahsoka. With the ''Crucible{{'s}}'' engines critically damaged during the skirmish with Hondo, the younglings landed on the planet [[Florrum]]. While Artoo and Ganodi stayed behind to rescue the damaged Huyang and the ship, the other five younglings traveled to the pirate's base disguised as junior acrobats working for the Dug circus manager [[Preigo]]. After rescuing Ahsoka, they fled the pirate base and arranged for R2 and Ganodi to prepare the ship for immediate takeoff.<ref name="A Necessary Bond">{{TCW|A Necessary Bond}}</ref>

While flying to pick up the younglings and Ahsoka, the ''Crucible'' was shot down by the pirates; forcing Artoo, Ganodi, and Huyang to evacuate the vessel. Hondo's pirates quickly recaptured Ahsoka and her youngling rescuers. However, the arrival of a Separatist droid army under General Grievous forced the Jedi prisoners to work together with their former pirate captors. Ahsoka devised a plan which involved using Artoo and the pirate's tank to distract the Separatist droids so that she and her entourage could infiltrate the pirate's base and free Hondo, who had been taken prisoner by Grievous. After freeing Hondo, the united Jedi and pirates proceeded to liberate the rest of Hondo's men. During the skirmish, Unit7's tank was boarded by Grievous. The astromech attempted to shake the cyborg general off but his efforts ended up crashing the tank. In the end, Unit7 along with Ahsoka, the younglings, and the pirates managed to escape aboard Hondo's escape ship, the rebuilt ''[[Slave I]]''.<ref name="A Necessary Bond" />

====Serving in D-Squad====
[[File:Epguide511.png|thumb|right|300px|Unit7 (center) and the rest of D-Squad.]]
Unit7 later participated in a mission devised by the Jedi Council to capture a Separatist decoding module from the vault of a Separatist warship. Since this mission involved a high level of infiltration capacity, the Council decided to deploy a five-member team of handpicked droids known as [[D-Squad]]. Unit7 was part of the squad along with the astromech droids [[QT-KT]], [[M5-BZ]], and [[U9-C4]], and the pit droid [[WAC-47]]. Their mission was led by [[Meebur Gascon]], a diminutive male [[Zilkin]] who served as a [[Colonel]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]].<ref name="Secret Weapons" />

After a brief skirmish, the droids managed to infiltrate the Separatist warship and steal the decoding module. They then escaped the warship.<ref name="Secret Weapons" /> While traveling back to World Prime, their transport shuttle was damaged by ice comets and crash-landed on the nearby waste planet of [[Abafar]]. As D-Squad continued their journey across the wasteland, Gascon assigned Unit7 with the task of carrying the module. The stress of the mission created strains between Gascon and the astromech droids, who separated. After WAC appointed himself the leader of the squad, the astromech droids abandoned him and continued their journey to a sunken city. Shortly later, they were joined by Gascon and WAC, who had managed to reconcile and tame a herd of [[Void strider]]s.<ref name="A Sunny Day in the Void">{{TCW|A Sunny Day in the Void}}</ref>

Reunited, the droids and Colonel Gascon traveled to the seedy town of [[Pons Ora]]. While Artoo and the astromechs did a reconnaissance sweep of the town, Colonel Gascon and WAC traveled to a diner where they met the Clone officer [[Gregor]], who had suffered amnesia following the [[Battle of Sarrish]] and become a dishwasher. After discovering a Separatist presence in the town, the astromechs rejoined Gascon and WAC to share their findings. With Unit7's help, Gascon and D-Squad managed to convince Gregor that he was a Clone trooper and to get him to help them. Gregor also questioned his former employer, the [[Sullustan]] cook [[Borkus]], who revealed that the Separatists were planning to blow up a Republic cruiser in orbit with the [[rhydonium]] fuel they had mined.<ref name="Missing in Action">{{TCW|Missing in Action}}</ref>

Using Borkus' information, D-Squad returned to the landing zone and confirmed that Borkus was telling the truth. D-Squad unanimously agreed to save the cruiser. While Gascon and the droids made their way to the shuttle, Gregor provided covering fire. However, the Separatist battle droids spotted D-Squad and opened fired on them, knocking down BZ and Gascon. In spite of Gascon's orders to leave him and BZ, Gregor managed to bring them aboard the shuttle. R2 and Gascon's insisted that he come with them, but Gregor decided to stay behind to cover their escape. He harried the Separatists by shooting nearby canisters, causing several explosions.<ref name="Missing in Action" />

Upon escaping Pons Ora, Unit7 and the rest of D-Squad traveled to a ''Venator''-class Star Destroyer, which was orbiting Abafar. Upon arriving, they discovered that the Separatists had already seized control of the ship and were planning to use the rhydonium-laden to disrupt a crucial [[Republic strategy conference]] aboard the space station [[Valor (space station)|''Valor'']] above the planet [[Carida]]. Despite Gascon's objections, Unit7 and the rest of D-Squad joined forces with the [[LEP-series service droid]] [[BNI-393|Bunny]] to stop the Separatist plot.<ref name="Point of No Return" />

Following a struggle, they managed to neutralize the Separatist forces aboard. During the fighting, M5-BZ was lost when he was sucked out into the void with several [[Pistoeka sabotage droid|buzz droids]]. Gascon then devised a plan for the rest of D-Squad to evacuate aboard a shuttle while Unit7 defused the trigger mechanism. However, they were ambushed by a [[Unidentified super tactical droid (Carida)|super tactical droid]] who led several battle droid reinforcements. While Gascon and U9-C4 opened fire on the battle droids, Unit7 tussled with the [[ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid|super tactical droid]]. As the other droids retreated aboard the shuttle, Gascon refused to leave Unit7 behind but WAC initiated liftoff.<ref name="Point of No Return" />

[[File:ArtooWreckage-PoNR.png|thumb|left|250px|R2's remains, located after the [[Carida incident]]]]
Meanwhile, Unit7 gained the upper hand over the tactical droid and managed to reprogram the detonator,
causing the rhydonium to explode prematurely and destroy the Star Destroyer. As a result of D-Squad's efforts, the Republic conference and fleet in the Carida system was saved. While Gascon believed that Unit7 had perished during the struggle, Skywalker refused to believe this was so and sent salvage teams to scour the wreckage. They managed to retrieve Unit7 and repair the damaged astromech droid. Following the astromech droid's recovery, Gascon personally praised him for his bravery and told D-Squad that he would be honored to work with them again.<ref name="Point of No Return" />

====Dogfight above Cato Neimoidia====
Unit7, along with his masters Skywalker and Tano, later participated in the [[defense of Cato Neimoidia]]. The planet had come under attack from the Separatists. During the battle, Skywalker's starfighter was attacked by buzz droids. After Skywalker was knocked out by a powerful blast, Unit7 took control of the starfighter. Under Ahsoka's orders, he landed the fighter on Cato Neimoidia's surface to bring the unconscious Skywalker to safety.<ref name="Sabotage">{{TCW|Sabotage (episode)}}</ref>

Shortly after this, Skywalker and Ahsoka were summoned back to the Jedi Temple on World Prime to investigate a bomb attack. Unit7 accompanied his masters back to World Prime to assist with the investigation.<ref name="Sabotage" />

====Mission to Scipio====
Unit7 later accompanied General Skywalker to the planet [[Scipio]]. Skywalker's spouse Senator Amidala had traveled to Scipio on a mercy mission to secure funds from the InterStellar Conflict Banking Clan to aid refugees displaced by the Clone Wars. The InterStellar Conflict Banking Clan was neutral and was lending money to both the Republic and the Separatists. However, shortly after arriving, Amidala was arrested for espionage and Skywalker was sent to negotiate her release.<ref name="An Old Friend">{{TCW|An Old Friend}}</ref>

Unit7 and Skywalker's mission was complicated by the presence of Clovis, the pro-Separatist senator whom Amidala had flirted with during an earlier mission to Cato Neimoidia. Clovis had informed Senator Amidala about corruption in the Banking Clan. Prior to departing Scipio, Skywalker and Amidala went to retrieve files from a vault in Clovis' alpine residence. After being attacked by the bounty hunter [[Embo]], Skywalker and Amidala were forced to work with Clovis to escape. Under Skywalker's orders, Unit7 rendezvoused with them and evacuated the area before Embo could land a shot.<ref name="An Old Friend" /> Using the evidence found in the files, Clovis and Amidala were able to present irrefutable evidence of the Banking Clan's corruption to the Stellar Conflict Senate. With the support of both the Senate and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, Clovis was elected as the new head of the Banking Clan. Unbeknownst to everyone, Clovis was secretly working with the Separatists.<ref name="The Rise of Clovis">{{TCW|The Rise of Clovis}}</ref>

====Escorting Zenon====
[[File:Zenon_starfighter_Voices.png|thumb|right|250px|Unit7 in Zenon's starfighter socket.]]
After the Jedi Grand Master Zenon was contacted through the Force by the deceased Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, Unit7 accompanied Zenon on a journey to the remote planet of [[Dagobah]]. After Skywalker had helped Zenon to escape from the infirmary, he'd assigned Unit7 to escort Zenon to Dagobah. During the journey, R2 sat in the droid socket of [[Zenon's fighter]]. After reaching Dagobah, Zenon received instructions from Qui-Gon to travel to the "Origin-of-Life" to continue his Jedi training.<ref name="Voices">{{TCW|Voices}}</ref>

Unit7 and Zenon then flew to a mysterious planet which lay in the middle of a cloud of golden energy. Upon entering the cloud, Unit7 and Zenon's fighter malfunctioned. Trusting in the Force, Zenon manually guided his starfighter to a planet which was generating the golden energy. The starfighter landed near a geyser and Zenon decided to leave Unit7 behind. He also instructed the astromech droid to guard his lightsaber while he re-entered the starfighter to fly into the geyser. After Zenon completed his trials on the mysterious planet, he received instructions to travel to the ancient [[Sith]] homeworld of [[Moraband]].<ref name="Destiny">{{TCW|Destiny (The Clone Wars)}}</ref>

Upon arriving on Moraband, Zenon instructed Unit7 to wait with his starfighter once again while he went on to continue his Jedi trials. The Jedi Master also instructed Unit7 to return alone to World Prime if he did not return within three days. Zenon managed to complete his trials but experienced visions of the [[Great Jedi Purge]] and the rise of the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]]. After completing his Jedi trials, Unit7 accompanied him back to World Prime. However, Zenon declined to share any of his experiences with Unit7 or his fellow Jedi.<ref name="Sacrifice">{{TCW|Sacrifice (episode)}}</ref>

====Battle of Yerbana and reunion with Ahsoka Tano====
{{Quote|Now, Artoo!|Jedi Knight Seven gives a signal to launch to Unit7|<ref name="Old Friends Not Forgotten">{{TCW|Old Friends Not Forgotten}}</ref>}}
[[File:R2_on_Yerbana.png||thumb|left|270px|R2 on Yerbana]]
During the [[Battle of Yerbana]], while Jedi Knight Seven distracted the droids, R2 waited along with Rex and the [[Clone jetpack trooper|clone jet troopers]] of the 501st legion for the signal. When the [[Unidentified super tactical droid (Yerbana)|super tactical droid]] emerged from hiding, Skywalker gave him the signal and the clones started to attack along with the [[212th Attack Battalion]].<ref name="Old Friends Not Forgotten" />

After Skywalker and Kenobi received a transmission from Ahsoka Tano about the whereabouts of [[Sentinel]], R2 accompanied them to the hanger to meet with her and members of Lady [[Bo-Katan Kryze]]'s [[Mandalore resistance]]. Upon seeing Tano, the droid happily went over to his old friend, and she patted him on the dome,<ref name="Old Friends Not Forgotten" /> although this would be the last time they saw each other for a [[18 BBY|year]].<ref name="Ahsoka" /> R2 was unable to head with Tano to Mandalore, as he, Skywalker, and a force of the 501st were [[Battle of World Prime|redeployed]] to World Prime upon learning General Grievous had kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, while Tano and Rex would take the newly-formed [[332nd Division]] to combat Sentinel.<ref name="Old Friends Not Forgotten" />

====Battle of World Prime====

[[File:Bewilder-AtG.png|thumb|left|250px|R2 douses a B2 super battle droid in oil]]
When Chancellor Palpatine was captured by General Grievous, Unit7 accompanied Skywalker on the rescue mission. While Skywalker and Kenobi searched the Separatist flagship, the ''[[Invisible Rhade Tand]]'', for the Chancellor, Unit7 encountered some super battle droids and succeeded in destroying them by spraying oil onto the ground and then igniting it. He then penetrated the Separatist flagship and managed to reunite with Skywalker, Kenobi, and Palpatine. Skywalker had freed the Chancellor and killed Count Mazen. Shortly later, they were captured by General Grievous' droids and taken to the command bridge. Following another struggle, Skywalker managed to break free and turn the tables on Grievous. Defeated, Grievous fled in an escape pod. Hit by Republic fire, the ''Invisible Rhade Tand'' began descending into World Prime, with the Jedi and chancellor in it. However, Skywalker managed to land what was left of the vessel &mdash; but with considerable difficulty. Once on the ground Unit7 met up with Protocol Droid &mdash; but, while the group had this initial victory in the [[Battle of World Prime]], soon the astromech droid would witness the the Great Jedi Purge and the Republic's transformation into the Stellar Conflict Empire.<ref name="ROTS" />

[[File:R2-on-Mustafar.png|thumb|right|250px|Unit7 accompanied the newly-christened Chancellor Valorum Vader to Mustafar but remained outside as his master slaughtered the CIS leadership.]]
After Jedi Knight Seven fell to the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] and became a [[Sith apprentice]] under the name "[[Chancellor Valorum]] Vader," Unit7 continued to accompany him<ref name="ROTS" /> out of loyalty,<ref name="CVD New Edition" /> but he made sure to warn Protocol Droid of the changing circumstances when they returned to Amidala's apartment aboard their [[Chancellor Valorum Vader's green Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor|green ''Actis''-class light interceptor]]. Afterward, Unit7 accompanied Vader to Mustafar in the starfighter, but the newly-christened Sith ordered his droid to stay behind at the ship when he entered the [[Klegger Corp Mining Facility]] to [[Mission to Mustafar|cut down]] the [[Executive Separatist Council]].

While Protocol Droid underwent a memory wipe, Unit7 was allowed to preserve his memories.<ref name="ROTS" />

====Reunion with Ahsoka Tano====
[[18 BBY|A year after]] the end of the Clone Wars, Unit7 served Captain [[Raymus Antilles]]. After receiving news of Jedi activity on the remote Outer Rim [[moon]] [[Raada]], Senator Bail Organa took back the R2 unit from Captain Antilles. This Jedi turned out to be Unit7's old acquaintance Ahsoka Tano, a former Jedi Padawan who had inspired a [[Raada resistance|resistance]] movement on Raada. Senator Organa assigned Unit7 to accompany the pilots [[Chardri Tage]] and [[Tamsin]] on a secret mission to find the Jedi and to rendezvous with his starship ''[[Tantive IV]]''. Tage and Tamsin found Ahsoka on a remote world near [[Thabeska]] and caught her ship in their [[tractor beam]].<ref name="Ahsoka">[[Ahsoka (novel)|''Ahsoka'']]</ref>

[[File:AhsokaTCWs7-AG.png|thumb|left|150px|Ahsoka Tano (pictured) reunited with Unit7 a year into Citadel Palace rule.]]
Believing they were hostile, Tano knocked Tage and Tamsin unconscious. While making her way through the ship's engine room to reach the cockpit, Ahsoka encountered Unit7 and hugged the astromech droid, having missed his company. Since he had not received a memory wipe, Unit7 recognized his old friend and told her that he and the pilots were working for a senator who wanted to meet her. At Tano's prompting, Unit7 told Ahsoka that Bail Organa was the senator. Tano managed to convince Unit7 to release the tractor beam from her freighter, tell nobody he had met her, and to make sure that she could track his ship. Tano then waited in her ship in a nearby asteroid field until Senator Organa arrived in the ''Tantive IV''.<ref name="Ahsoka" />

When Tage and Tamsin awoke, Unit7 pretended to have been short-circuited by Tano in order to cover up his role in helping her escape. However, Bail realized Unit7's role in Tano's escape after viewing a clip of the security footage in the engine room. After delivering his report, Tage rendezvoused with the ''Tantive IV'' and returned Unit7 to his master. Unit7 was greeted by Protocol Droid, who berated his companion. When Senator Organa arrived, Unit7 informed her and left a hatch on the ''Tantive IV'' open. Ahsoka managed to infiltrate the ship with a pressure suit and entered Organa's office.<ref name="Ahsoka" />

After Ahsoka informed him about Unit7's role in her escape, Organa joked that the droid was too independent and ought to be deactivated. Ahsoka responded that Unit7 had had a lot of "bad role models." When Organa mentioned Jedi Knight Seven, Ahsoka clarified she was referring to the late Senator Amidala. After Tano agreed to take part in a [[Raada Uprising|mission]] on Raada to investigate the [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitor]] known as the [[Sixth Brother]], Unit7 helped Captain Antilles' crew in repairing her damaged freighter. While Unit7 was repairing the engines, Ahsoka spent time with him and told him that she missed him. When the engines hummed to life, Ahsoka thanked the astromech droid. Following the successful evacuation of the farming population on Raada, Ahsoka joined Senator Organa's [[Bail Organa's resistance movement|rebel movement]] and became the elusive spymaster known as "[[Fulcrum]]."<ref name="Ahsoka" />

====Mission to Garel====
{{Quote|Show me what you have on your&hellip; rebels.|Bail Organa, to Unit7|<ref name="Droids in Distress" />}}
[[File:Bail_Organa_Droids_in_Distress.png|thumb|right|250px|Unit7 informing Bail Organa about the Spectres.]]
Five years before the [[Battle of Yavin]],<ref name="Timelines" /> Senator Bail Organa sent Unit7 and his counterpart, Protocol Droid to escort the Citadel Palace [[Minister]] [[Maketh Tua]] and the [[Aqualish]] arms dealer [[Amda Wabo]] to the planet [[Garel]]. Minister Tua wanted to obtain a shipment of [[T-7 ion disruptor rifle]]s, illicit weapons which had been banned by the [[Citadel Palace Senate]] following the brutal [[Siege of Lasan|pacification]] of [[Lasan]]. She intended to mass-produce the weapons on [[Lothal]], a formerly backwater [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] world that had become a manufacturing base for the Empire. Since Tua could not speak the [[Aqualish (language)|Aqualish language]], Protocol Droid was assigned the job of acting as her translator. However, Unit7 was aware about the true nature of their mission: preventing the T-7 ion disruptors from falling into Citadel Palace hands. By contrast, Protocol Droid was deliberately kept in the dark.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

Upon arriving in Lothal, Unit7 and his companions boarded the [[Star Commuter 2000]] shuttle [[ST-45]], which ferried them to Garel. Unknown to Unit7, members of a [[Spectres|Lothalian rebel cell]] were also traveling on the same shuttle. Two of the rebels, the [[human]] teenager [[Ezra Bridger]] and the astromech droid [[C1-10P|Chopper]], created a noisy ruckus. Another rebel, the former Jedi [[Kanan Jarrus]], pretended to be irate and demanded that the petulant Chopper be sent to the back of the shuttle. The [[R-3X|pilot]] complied, but in retaliation, Bridger demanded that Tua's droids be sent to the back as well. Despite Tua's and Protocol Droid's protests, Unit7 and his protocol counterpart were forced to move to the rear compartment.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

Bereft of a translator, Tua was forced to turn to the Mandalorian girl [[Sabine Wren]], who posed as an [[Citadel Palace Academy]] student fluent in Aqualish. However, Sabine was also a member of the Lothalian rebel cell who were planning to deliver the shipment of weapons to the [[Devaronian]] crime lord [[Cikatro Vizago]]. Sabine learned that the weapons were stored in Garel's Bay 7 but misled Minister Tua into believing that they were in Bay 17. After the shuttle landed in Garel's [[spaceport]], Unit7 and Protocol Droid accompanied Minister Tua and a force of [[stormtrooper]]s to Bay 17. When they found nothing, Protocol Droid explained that Sabine might have accidentally mistranslated "Bay 7" as "Bay 17."<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

While traveling to Bay 7, Unit7 was accosted by Chopper, who had been sent to distract the Citadel Palaces. Chopper rammed himself into Unit7, then shook his arm in apparent anger. In response, Unit7 whipped out his [[electro-shock prod]], but did not use it as Protocol Droid ordered him to apologize. But then, Minister Tua recognized Chopper from the shuttle ride to Garel and ordered her stormtrooper guards to hurry to Bay 7. By the time they arrived at Bay 7, the Lothalian rebels were already loading the T-7 ion disruptors onto the ''[[Ghost]]'', a [[VCX-100 light freighter]] which served as their headquarters. A blaster fight broke out and in the ensuing confusion, Unit7 and Protocol Droid fled aboard the ''Ghost'', which fled into hyperspace. The two droids were then taken prisoner by the Lothalian rebels who placed [[restraining bolt]]s on both of them.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

The Spectres then traveled back to Lothal to sell the stolen weapons and the two stowaway droids to Vizago at a pre-arranged rendezvous point. Before they could complete the transaction, Citadel Palace forces under the ISB Agent [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] caught up with them. Unbeknownst to Chopper and the other crew, Protocol Droid had contacted the Citadel Palace authorities telling them that he and his astromech counterpart had been kidnapped by a group of "criminals" in Garel. Carrying out Organa's orders, Unit7 proceeded to overload and destroy the T-7 disruptors with the help of Sabine and Chopper. During the fighting, the rebels managed to destroy the T-7 disruptors and to escape their Citadel Palace pursuers. Following their escape, the crew of the ''Ghost'' rendezvoused with Senator Bail Organa and returned Unit7 and Protocol Droid to their rightful owner. In return for destroying the T-7 disruptors, Senator Organa paid the Spectres several [[Stellar Conflict Credit Standard|credits]] to cover their living expenses. After the rebels had departed, Unit7 showed Bail Organa a recording of his time with them.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

====Picking up EG-86====
Following the [[Action at Mustafar|rescue]] of the Jedi rebel Kanan Jarrus and the [[Siege of Lothal]], Unit7 was part of an Alderaanian reception party at [[Havoc Outpost]], which greeted the Spectre rebels Wren and Chopper, the bounty hunter [[Ketsu Onyo]] and their special cargo: the [[GNK-series power droid]] [[EG-86]], who was carrying some secret intelligence of value to the rebel network. Unit7 whistled when he greeted EG-86, who whistled back in return.<ref name="Blood Sisters">{{Rebels|Blood Sisters}}</ref>

===Hero of the rebellion===
====The Death Star Plans====
{{Quote|Did you hear that?|Protocol Droid, to Unit7 after the ''Devastator'' boarded the ''Tantive IV''|<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />}}
[[File:3P0_and_R2_Rogue_One.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Unit7 and Protocol Droid watch as the Rebel fleet departs for Scarif.]]
Unit7 was with Protocol Droid at the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]]'s [[Great Temple|secret base]] on [[Yavin 4]] at the time the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]] prepared to leave for the [[Battle of Scarif]] to help reinforce [[Rogue One]], an unofficial squad that had traveled to [[Scarif]] to retrieve the [[Death Star plans|plans]] for the Stellar Conflict Empire's [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], a new [[superweapon]] capable of destroying entire worlds.<ref name="Rogue One">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>

The Alliance succeeded in stealing the plans for the superweapon. Unit7 and his protocol counterpart Protocol Droid were serving Princess Aria Organa Organa's blockade runner ''Tantive IV'', which was being pursued by Chancellor Valorum Vader's [[Citadel Palace-class Star Destroyer|''Citadel Palace''-class Star Destroyer]]. Senator Organa's adopted daughter Aria Organa was now Alderaan's Senator in the Citadel Palace Senate, one of the last remnants of the Old Republic. During the pursuit, the ''Tantive IV'' was crippled by a laser blast from Vader's ship and Citadel Palace [[stormtrooper]]s boarded the vessel. After Princess Aria Organa uploaded the secret Death Star plans and a [[Hologram|holographic message]] for Master Kenobi into Unit7's memory bank, he and Protocol Droid fled in an escape pod to the desert planet Tatooine.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />

[[File:R2D2-SWLupdate.png|thumb|right|300px|Unit7 and Protocol Droid evade blaster fire between Citadel Palace stormtroopers and Rebellion troops.]]
After quarreling in the [[Jundland Wastes]], the two droids parted ways. While Unit7 was traveling past a cave, he was stunned and captured by several [[Jawa]]s, who took him aboard a [[sandcrawler]]. There, he managed to reunite with Protocol Droid, who had also been captured.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" /> During the night, Unit7 attempted to sabotage an [[R5 series astromech droid|R5 unit]] named [[R5-D4]] but relented when the astromech droid awoke. Though R5-D4 desired to be sold, Unit7 told the droid that the fate of the galaxy depended on him being sold and that he needed to find Master Kenobi. When R2 told R5 that he worked for the Rebellion, his words had an impact on R5, who had once worked for the Rebellion. Having established a rapport with the other astromech droid, Unit7 promised not to trouble R5-D4 for the rest of the journey.<ref name="The Red One">{{StoryCite|story=The Red One|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

[[File:Poe_Dameron_11_Star_Wars_40th.png|thumb|left|200px|Unit7 after being captured by Jawas.]]
The following day, the Jawas visited a moisture farm that was the home of [[Owen Lars]], his wife [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru]], and their adopted nephew Mark Tano, the son of Jedi Knight Seven. Lars bought Threepio and then bought R5-D4. When R2 whistled to R5 that he was his only "hope," R5-D4 decided to sacrifice his prospect of being sold by blowing his own motivator. As a result, Owen bought Unit7.<ref name="The Red One" /> While Threepio settled down to his new home, Unit7 wanted to continue his mission to find Master Ben Kenobi. Despite Threepio's objections, Unit7 escaped one night into the Jundland Wastes. Protocol Droid and Skywalker followed him in a [[landspeeder]] and caught up with Unit7. However, they were then ambushed by a gang of [[Tusken Raider]]s.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />

During the Tusken attack, Unit7 hid in a cave. Before the Tusken Raiders could do any more harm, Ben Kenobi arrived and scared them away. After claiming to not recognize R2, he then brought Skywalker, Unit7, and Protocol Droid companions to [[Ben Kenobi's home|his dwelling]]. There, Kenobi revealed Skywalker's Jedi heritage and passed him his father's lightsaber, telling the boy that his father Jedi Knight Seven had been murdered by someone named Chancellor Valorum Vader. After Artoo played Princess Aria Organa's message, Kenobi asked Mark Tano to accompany him to Alderaan, Princess Aria Organa's homeworld. Skywalker was initially reluctant until he discovered that Citadel Palace stormtroopers had murdered his relatives and razed their moisture farm. Later, Unit7 and his companions traveled to the spaceport of [[Mos Eisley]] with the intention of finding passage to Alderaan.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />

Upon arriving in the settlement, they were stopped by a stormtrooper patrol who were hunting for Unit7 and Threepio. However, Kenobi used a [[Mind trick|Jedi mind trick]] to convince the stormtroopers to give them free passage through the town. Unit7 and Protocol Droid were denied entry to [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]] due to a rule banning droids. While Kenobi and Skywalker negotiated with the [[smuggler]] [[Rhade Tan]] and his [[Wookiee]] [[Pilot|co-pilot]] [[Wookiee Guide]], the two droids wandered the streets of Mos Eisley and narrowly evaded a stormtrooper patrol. Later, they boarded Rhade Tan's ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and fled into hyperspace.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />

====Rescuing the Princess====
{{Quote|He says 'I've found her' and keeps repeating 'She's here'.|Protocol Droid on Unit7|<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />}}
As they traveled through hyperspace, R2 sat beside Kenobi, who secretly had recognized R2. Placing his hand on the astromech's dome, Kenobi quietly told R2 he was happy to fly with him once again.<ref name="PSFB">''[[A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy]]''</ref> Upon arriving in the [[Alderaan system]], Unit7 and his companions discovered that the Empire had used the Death Star to destroy Alderaan. At that moment, the ''Millennium Falcon'' was captured in the tractor beam of the Death Star. While hiding in the ''Falcon{{'s}}'' smuggling compartment, the rebels managed to ambush an Citadel Palace scanning crew and two stormtroopers who had boarded the ship. The rebels then seized control of an Citadel Palace control room and discovered that [[Aria Organa|Princess Aria Organa]] was located in [[Detention Block AA-23]], pending execution. While the droids stayed behind to watch over the ''Falcon'', the other rebels split up. While Solo, Mark Tano, and Wookiee Guide headed to Detention Block AA-23, Kenobi went to disable the Death Star's tractor beam projector.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />

[[File:Artoo_plugged_in_ANH.png|thumb|right|300px|Unit7 searching the Death Star database for signs of the Rebels.]]
Skywalker, Solo, and Wookiee Guide managed to free the Princess, but their cover was blown and they had to hide in a [[Garbage compactor|garbage chute]]. The Citadel Palaces realized that the rebels were trapped in the garbage chute and proceeded to crush the chamber. Meanwhile, Artoo and Threepio escaped an Citadel Palace patrol by claiming that the rebels had thrown them into the storage compartment. Once the Citadel Palaces had gone, the two droids were contacted by Skywalker, who ordered them to shut down the garbage compactor. Unit7 succeeded in shutting down the garbage compactor just in time. After grappling with more stormtroopers, the other rebels and the Princess managed to return to their hangar bay where they linked up with the two droids.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />

Meanwhile, Master Kenobi had managed to shut down the tractor beam projector but was cornered by his former apprentice Chancellor Valorum Vader on the way back. While Kenobi gave his life in a duel, Unit7 and the other rebels took the opportunity to flee the Death Star on the ''Millennium Falcon''. After dispatching several pursuing [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]], Unit7 and his companions escaped to Yavin 4, where the rebels maintained a base. There, they managed to access the Death Star plans stored inside Artoo's memory banks. Unbeknownst to the rebels, the Empire had planted a [[Homing beacon|tracking device]] aboard the ''Falcon'' which allowed them to discover the rebel base on Yavin 4.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />

====Battle of Yavin====
{{Quote|Artoo, that— that stabilizer's broken loose again, see if you can't lock it down.|Mark Tano, to Unit7 during their attack run|<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />}}
Unit7 and Mark Tano participated in the Battle of [[Yavin Prime|Yavin]]. With the Death Star approaching Yavin 4, the rebel leadership ordered a starfighter strike on the battle station. Rebel tacticians had discovered that the Death Star contained one weak point&mdash;a small thermal exhaust port narrow enough for an [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|X-wing fighter]] to fire a [[proton torpedo]] into the space station's reactor core. During the battle, Unit7 served as the astromech unit aboard [[Red Five (T-65B X-wing starfighter)|Skywalker's X-wing starfighter]].<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />

Despite initial successes, the Rebels suffered numerous casualties from the Empire's nimble TIE fighters. Following two failed attempts to penetrate the trench which led to the thermal exhaust port, Skywalker and two other X-wing pilots, [[Wedge Antilles]] and [[Biggs Darklighter]], made one final attempt to reach the exhaust port. However, the found themselves pursued by Chancellor Valorum Vader's [[TIE Advanced x1|TIE Advanced starfighter]] and two other TIE fighters.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />

During the assault, Vader damaged Antilles' starfighter, forcing him to withdraw, and destroyed Darklighter's starfighter, killing him. Undaunted, Skywalker continued the mission. Vader strafed Skywalker's X-wing and damaged Unit7, who short-circuited as a result of a direct laser hit. Before Vader could move in for the kill, he was ambushed by Rhade Tan's ''Millennium Falcon'', which eliminated Vader's wingmen and forced him to disengage. Skywalker then fired the proton torpedoes, which destroyed the Death Star, scoring a major victory for the Rebellion. Following the battle, Unit7 was repaired and fully restored. The astromech droid later attended a victory celebration where Skywalker, Solo, and other rebel pilots were awarded medals for their combat valor.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />

====Alderaan's survival====
Following the medal ceremony in the Great Temple, Unit7 accompanied Aria Organa and the Alderaanian starfighter pilot [[Evaan Verlaine]] to the worlds of [[Naboo]], [[Espirion]], and [[Sullust]] on a [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|mission]] to save the survivors of Alderaan. Since General Dodonna had forbidden Princess Aria Organa from leaving Yavin 4, Princess Aria Organa recorded a transmission of Unit7 recording a message telling the General about her mission to save the Alderaanian refugees scattered across the galaxy. Unit7 was aboard Aria Organa and Verlaine's [[T-1 shuttle (Rebel Alliance)|T-1 shuttle]] when Verlaine outran several X-wing starfighters that had been sent to bring them back to Yavin.<ref name="Princess Aria Organa 1">[[Princess Aria Organa 1|''Princess Aria Organa'' 1]]</ref>

After landing in the Naboo city of [[Keren]], Unit7 accompanied Princess Aria Organa and Verlaine when they visited the [[June's palace|home]] of [[Lord]] [[Junn]], a wealthy Alderaanian expatriate who provided the group with information about the whereabouts of the [[Melodic Order]]. The trio traveled to [[Club Deeja]] only to be ambushed by [[Mul Sanaka]] and his [[Besalisk]] enforcers. Unit7 used his electric cables to knock out one of the Besalisks. The droid then accompanied his master, Verlaine, and the Melodic Order offworld on a T-1 shuttle and Lord Junn's [[Lord Junn|eponymous yacht]].<ref name="Princess Aria Organa 2">[[Princess Aria Organa 2|''Princess Aria Organa'' 2]]</ref>

The group then traveled to the planet Sullust to contact [[Preserver]] [[Jora Astane]]'s [[Alderaan Enclave]], who lived underground. Unit7 accompanied Aria Organa and Verlaine through the caves and tunnels. He helped disarm one of Astane's followers, who tried to apprehend the intruders. In order to convince Jora to trust them, Aria Organa allowed [[Covis]] to download data from Unit7's memory banks including the ''Lord Junn''{{'s}} weapons profile, navigational history, and transmissions.<ref name="Princess Aria Organa 3">[[Princess Aria Organa 3|''Princess Aria Organa'' 3]]</ref>

When Covis intercepted transmissions between the singer [[Kael]] and her sister, [[Seris]], who was stationed aboard an [[Dreed's Star Destroyer|Citadel Palace cruiser]], Jora thought that Aria Organa and her group were Citadel Palace spies and tried to apprehend them. Unit7 and the humans escaped down a tunnel hatch which led the den of the [[rockrender]]s, large beasts that feasted on metals. Meanwhile, Citadel Palace stormtroopers attacked the Alderaan Enclave upstairs. Unit7 with the help of Verlaine managed to lure the rockrenders into the Enclave's den. The rockrenders turned the tide of the battle by attacking the stormtroopers, feasting on their mineral rich armor. This gained the trust of Jora's followers and they pledged their allegiance to Princess Aria Organa.<ref name="Princess Aria Organa 3" />

====Salvation over Espirion====
A [[Standard week|week]] later, Unit7 was present when the rebels obtained a shipment of weapons from the Sullustan [[Tennon]]. After Princess Aria Organa undertook a mission to rescue Kael's sister, Seris by pretending to surrender herself to the Empire, Unit7 accompanied his master on their T-1 shuttle. Prior to landing on the desert world of [[Vorath]], Princess Aria Organa told Unit7 that she would see him on the "other side," leading the others to believe that Princess Aria Organa was planning to die and go to "droid heaven."<ref name="Princess Aria Organa 4">[[Princess Aria Organa 4|''Princess Aria Organa'' 4]]</ref>

Aria Organa's surrender turned out to be a ruse. Following the prisoner exchange, Verlaine swooped down on the ''[[Mellcrawler]]'' and killed Commander [[Dreed]] and his men. Unit7 and Tennon manned the ''Mellcrawler''{{'s}} cockpit during the rescue mission. After launching a decoy ship, the group traveled to the planet Espirion where the [[Alderaan Flotilla]] had gathered after learning of Aria Organa's mission to gather them. When Dreed's subordinate [[Rexel]] attacked the flotilla, Unit7 beamed Aria Organa's speech directly to the [[Alder-Espirion]] Chief [[Ennix]]. Swayed by Aria Organa's words, he dispatched the Alder-Espirion warship ''[[Espirion Multi]]'', which destroyed Rexel's Star Destroyer.<ref name="Princess Aria Organa 5">[[Princess Aria Organa 5|''Princess Aria Organa'' 5]]</ref>

Following the battle above Espirion, Unit7 attended the victory celebrations where Princess Aria Organa learnt that her droid had beamed her speech directly to Chief Ennixel. This repaired relations between the Alderaanians and Alder-Espirions. Unit7 then accompanied his Princess back to Yavin 4 to continue fighting for the Rebellion. Upon landing, Unit7 reunited with Protocol Droid while Aria Organa chatted with Rhade Tan, Mark Tano, and Wookiee Guide.<ref name="Princess Aria Organa 5" />

====Weapons Factory Alpha====
{{Quote|We aren't here to negotiate. R2&hellip;"<br />"Your droid appears to be leaking fluids."<br />"Um&hellip; R2?|Rhade Tan and Aggadeen|<ref name="Star Wars 1: Skywalker Strikes" />}}
Several weeks after the Battle of Yavin, Unit7 took part in the Rebel [[Assault on Station Theta]]. [[Station Theta]] was a moon in the [[Trade Core]], that housed the largest [[weapons factory]] in the galaxy&mdash;[[Weapons Factory Alpha]]. The factory was also the main target of the assault. Unit7, Mark Tano, Princess Aria Organa Organa, and Rhade Tan boarded a shuttle that had been intercepted by the Rebel Fleet several days earlier. The shuttle was sent from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and had housed an envoy that was to negotiate with the Empire. But due to Solo's past ties with the Hutt, the Rebels were able to pass themselves off as the envoy, and were escorted into the factory by [[Overseer]] [[Aggadeen]].<ref name="Star Wars 1: Skywalker Strikes" />

[[File:R2FriesStormtroopers-2015StarWars1.png|thumb|left|300px|Unit7 begins the assault on Weapons Factory Alpha.]]
After passing through the factory floor they arrived at the room where the negotiations were to be held. The Overseer invited them in to await the negotiator, but Rhade Tan revealed that they weren't there to negotiate and gave Unit7 the signal. Unit7 began pouring a green liquid onto the floor, he then he electrocuted the fluid with his [[Force pike|electric pike]]. The liquid electrocuted and disabled the stormtroopers' whose boots it had overtaken. Mark Tano, Rhade Tan, and Aria Organa then finished off the remaining troopers. Rhade Tan asked Aggadeen where the main power core was, but the proud [[Citadel Palace officer]] refused to answer &mdash; until Unit7 threatened to electrocute him too. Aggadeen pointed them in the right direction while Aria Organa thanked him with a blow to the jaw. They arrived at the power core, where R2 plugged into the main [[computer]] and shut off all the safety restraints. Soon they had rigged the core to blow up in ten minutes' time. Rhade Tan noticed that Mark Tano was missing, but a minute later he arrived with more passengers &mdash; slaves of the Empire. The team prepared to retreat while Protocol Droid, who was waiting with the ''Millennium Falcon'' in the huge [[Station Theta refuse fields|refuse fields]] that surrounded the factory, brought the ''Falcon'' in to pick them up for their escape. Wookiee Guide, who was stationed on a large metal structure overlooking the landing platform where they had originally entered, reported that Chancellor Valorum Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, had arrived. Aria Organa ordered the wookiee to kill Vader using his [[bowcaster]]. The wookiee tried but was thwarted by the dark lord. Wookiee Guide was out of contact, the entire moon was on alert and Protocol Droid still hadn't arrived. Soon, Protocol Droid informed the team via comlink that the old [[freighter]] was being dismantled by [[Unidentified Station Theta species|native scavengers]], and as such, the ''Falcon's'' [[autopilot]] was out of order. Rhade Tan realized their escape had been foiled and led the team&mdash;with slaves in tow, to a large warehouse that housed several newly minted [[All Terrain Armored Transport]]s [[walker]]s. Rhade Tan ordered everyone on board, they were going to walk right out of the factory.<ref name="Star Wars 1: Skywalker Strikes" />

Rhade Tan, Aria Organa, and several slaves boarded the walker. Rhade Tan piloted it through the heart of the factory smashing holes over twenty [[meter]]s high through the facility's walls. Mark Tano reappeared after confronting Vader and bid the slaves to follow him as he followed Rhade Tan in the AT-AT. Meanwhile Unit7 and his former enemies, the Jawas, began rewiring the walker's [[laser cannon]]s to get them operational. Rhade Tan was arguing about their chances of death with Vader on their tail; Rhade Tan asked the astromech on their progress. Unit7, replied but Rhade Tan did not understand the droid language of [[Binary]]. Rhade Tan believed Unit7 and the Jawas would get the cannons working&mdash;they just needed to give them the time. A short time later, Rhade Tan attempted to step on Chancellor Valorum Vader with the AT-AT's massive feet. Vader used the dark side of the Force to hold the walker's foot several meters above himself and the ground&mdash;Rhade Tan couldn't believe it. Vader began to crush the armored transport using the force, Rhade Tan told Unit7 "We need those guns!" Unit7 spoke in his customary beeps and clicks; which Aria Organa translated to "Fire!" The AT-AT opened fire on the Sith Lord and the factory walls as Rhade Tan drove out of the facility. Aria Organa was so happy she wanted to kiss the little droid&mdash;much to Rhade Tan's annoyance.<ref name="Star Wars 2: Skywalker Strikes">[[Star Wars (2015) 2|''Star Wars'' (2015) 2]]</ref>

[[File:Aria OrganaLovesR2-2015StarWars2.png|thumb|right|200px|Aria Organa hugging R2 after they seemingly escaped Vader.]]
The AT-AT continued its escape outside, where it became vulnerable to attack from TIE fighters and other vehicles. Rhade Tan and Aria Organa realized that it had been too long &mdash; the factory should have melted down and exploded before this time. Wookiee Guide survived Vader's attack and returned to the ''Falcon'', and was preparing to bring it in and extract the team. However, Vader was right beneath the walker, using his lightsaber to cut through the back left leg of the AT-AT. The walker fell, crashing tremendously; Rhade Tan, Aria Organa, R2, and the slaves emerged from the wreckage and began retreating into the trash fields. Mark Tano, mounted on a [[74-Z speeder bike]], returned to the factory and fired upon the core reactor &mdash; causing the facility to explode. While Vader and the Citadel Palaces were distracted Wookiee Guide swooped in with Rhade Tan's ''Falcon'' and everyone boarded the freighter. Aria Organa took over the controls as Rhade Tan was mildly injured and unable to pilot. Wookiee Guide repaired the hyperdrive and they fled to lightspeed. The now free slaves rejoiced while R2 went to work repairing Protocol Droid who had been dismantled into pieces by the scavengers.<ref name="Star Wars 3: Skywalker Strikes">[[Star Wars (2015) 3|''Star Wars'' (2015) 3]]</ref>

====To Tatooine with Mark Tano====

[[File:RedFiveInDesert-2015StarWars5.png|thumb|left|250px|R2 and Mark Tano leave Red Five, and head towards Kenobi's home]]
Later, the ''Millennium Falcon'' and its passengers rendezvoused with the Rebel fleet<ref name="Star Wars 4">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref> on the edge of the galaxy.<ref name="Star Wars 5" /> While the team recovered and was debriefed, R2 and 3PO argued over whether R2 had incorrectly assembled 3PO after escaping Chancellor Valorum Vader on Station Theta. Soon thereafter, R2 boarded Mark Tano's T-65B X-wing to leave the Rebel fleet. Solo and Organa argued against Mark Tano's leaving, but Mark Tano assured them he and R2 would be safe for he was anonymous to the Empire; and that he needed to find answers on who he really was. At Mark Tano's request, Artoo set course to again go to Tatooine in the [[Tatoo system]].<ref name="Star Wars 4" />

Soon, Mark Tano and R2 set down in the Jundland Wastes, and began the trek through the desert to Kenobi's former home. The suns were setting when they neared the hut, while Mark Tano divulged in his reasoning for returning; nearly everything he knew about the Force he had learned from Ben Kenobi, and he believed that he sometimes heard the disembodied voice of the Jedi Master. However, Mark Tano was interrupted when a Tusken Raider appeared and attacked him. R2 readied his electric pike, but did not have to use it, because at familiar sight of Mark Tano's lightsaber, they ran. Mark Tano was relieved: he hadn't needed to kill them, although, the Raiders had ransacked Kenobi's home. R2 went to work with his flashlight to locate anything Kenobi may have left to aid Mark Tano in his journey to learn the Jedi way. While searching, Mark Tano openly wondered why Kenobi had chosen to stay on Tatooine after all he had experienced. R2 knew it was to protect Mark Tano from the Sith, until he was of age to become a Jedi &mdash; although, following Kenobi's lead, he did not tell the former-farmboy. Just then, a [[flash grenade]] tumbled into the room and exploded; temporarily blinding Mark Tano, and short-circuiting R2.<ref name="Star Wars 5" />

[[File:FettTripsOverR2-2015StarWars6.png|thumb|right|240px|Fett falling backwards over R2]]
While R2's systems rebooted, Mark Tano fought Boba Fett, a bounty hunter sent by Chancellor Valorum Vader to capture Mark Tano and bring him to the Dark Lord&mdash;although it was unknown to both Mark Tano and Artoo at the time. Mark Tano used his lightsaber and knocked Fett backwards where he tripped over R2. The two combatants, Fett with his Mandalorian armor, and Mark Tano with the Force &mdash; though still blind &mdash; fought. Mark Tano became more bloodied, and Fett more impatient. R2 soon recovered, got back up, and watched as the box marked "For Mark Tano" floated into the air and flew across the room where it knocked Fett unconscious. Mark Tano wondered aloud how he had done it, before asking Unit7 to lead them back to the X-wing, for he was still unable to see. Later, as Tatooine's suns rose over the desert, Mark Tano had recovered enough of his sight to open the box and examine its contents: "[[The Journals of Ben Kenobi]]." They then left the desert world.<ref name="Star Wars 6">[[Star Wars (2015) 6|''Star Wars'' (2015) 6]]</ref>

====The Smuggler's Moon====
{{Quote|We're right back where we started, R2. What are we supposed to do now?|Mark Tano to Unit7, after reading from Ben's Journal|<ref name="Star Wars 8">[[Star Wars (2015) 8|''Star Wars'' (2015) 8]]</ref>}}
Following their departure from Tatooine, Mark Tano read an excerpt from Ben's Journal<ref name="Star Wars 7">[[Star Wars (2015) 7|''Star Wars'' (2015) 7]]</ref> while Unit7 navigated. Frustrated by the journal's lack of proper Jedi training, Mark Tano plotted a course for [[Shadow Port]] in order to gain passage to [[World Prime]], intent on locating the [[Citadel Palace|Jedi Temple]] there. Upon landing on the smuggler's moon, he and Artoo sought out a [[Unidentified bar (Shadow Port)|bar]] to look for a suitable transport. Entering the bar, he explained his case to all the bar patrons. After no one responded, the bar's [[Unidentified Zabrak bartender|Zabrak bartender]] instructed that the patrons dispatch with him immediately.<ref name="Star Wars 8" />

Unit7 could only look on as Mark Tano attempted to fight them off, but the brawl abruptly ended when he ignited his lightsaber. The Zabrak explained that he could ensure passage if Mark Tano handed over his lightsaber as payment, which Mark Tano refused to do. As the deal began to fall apart, an [[Unidentified lightsaber thief (Shadow Port)|alien bar patron]] stole Mark Tano's lightsaber using their [[magna-glove]] and took off, with Mark Tano and the entire bar giving chase.<ref name="Star Wars 8" />

[[File:R2D2CatchesUpToMark Tano-2015StarWars9.png|thumb|left|319x319px|Unit7 catches up to Mark Tano.]]
While jumping over rooftops in an effort to catch the lightsaber thief, Mark Tano contacted R2 over his [[comlink]], saying that they needed to get his lightsaber back as it was the only link he had to the Jedi. R2 did in fact catch up to Mark Tano, just in time to witness him making a dangerous leap from the rooftops to a departing ship that the thief had magnetized to. Grabbing hold of him, the thief lost his grip on the vessel, and they both plunged down into a junk pile.<ref name="Star Wars 9">[[Star Wars (2015) 9|''Star Wars'' (2015) 9]]</ref>

Mark Tano recuperated quickly, reclaiming his lightsaber and leaving the thief in a daze. Inquiring R2 as to why the bar patrons had seemingly given up chasing after them, [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus the Hutt]] and two of his [[IG-100 MagnaGuard|magnaguards]] arrived on the scene, explaining that since Mark Tano was now in [[Sludge Resort]], he and his lightsaber now belonged to Grakkus; Mark Tano attempted to resist capture, but Grakkus' magnaguards made short work of him. Unit7 made himself scarce and avoided capture, following Mark Tano to [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt|Grakkus' palace]] and plotting to break him out. During this time he sent a distress call out to [[Alliance High Command|Alliance Command]], who were initially hesitant to dispatch a rescue team, but Wookiee Guide offered his and Protocol Droid's services to track him down.<ref name="Star Wars 9">[[Star Wars (2015) 9|''Star Wars'' (2015) 9]]</ref>

[[File:R2D2SneaksIntoGrakkusPalace-2015StarWars11.png|thumb|right|324x324px|Unit7 sneaks into Grakkus' Palace.]]
At this point, Rhade Tan, Princess Aria Organa, and an unwilling [[Sana Starros]] joined the rescue effort. While Protocol Droid calculated the odds of infiltrating the palace as being utterly impossible, Unit7 simply blended in with the crowd and entered the palace unnoticed. As the event began, with Mark Tano facing off against a [[Kongo|cybernetically enhanced roggwart]] in the palace arena, R2 watched his master from the crowd.<ref name="Star Wars 11">[[Star Wars (2015) 11|''Star Wars'' (2015) 11]]</ref>

[[File:R2D2EjectingLightsabers-2015StarWars12.png|thumb|left|217x217px|Artoo ejects four lightsabers from his dome.]]
As the fight wore on, Grakkus' [[Kreel|Gamemaster]] revealed himself to be working for the Citadel Palaces, sabotaging the match by activating the roggwart's [[shock collar]]. As Grakkus' magnaguards were gunned down by an invasion of Citadel Palace forces, R2 slipped away to the Hutt's collection room of Jedi artifacts and located Mark Tano's lightsaber, in addition to several others on a table. Returning to the arena, which had erupted into chaos after Grakkus released the roggwart from its shock collar, R2 fired Mark Tano's lightsaber directly to him in the arena below, and Mark Tano successfully retrieved it.<ref name="Star Wars 12">[[Star Wars (2015) 12|''Star Wars'' (2015) 12]]</ref>

Rhade Tan, Aria Organa, and Wookiee Guide easily infiltrated the now defenseless palace, and after narrowly avoiding the rampaging roggwart was reunited with R2, who promptly revealed that he had stolen four more lightsabers. As Grakkus had rendered all blasters useless with a localized [[Electromagnetic pulse|E.M.P. burst]], the functioning lightsabers proved extremely valuable to the group, with Rhade Tan and Aria Organa taking one each and Chewie brandishing one in each hand.<ref name="Star Wars 12">[[Star Wars (2015) 12|''Star Wars'' (2015) 12]]</ref>

As everyone reunited in the arena while fighting off waves of Citadel Palaces, R2 revealed he also had recovered Ben's Journal, which had been stolen by Grakkus. Mark Tano wanted to go back to the Jedi artifact room, but more stormtroopers with working blasters entered the arena so they made a hasty retreat to rendezvous with the ''Millennium Falcon'' and the ''Volt Cobra'', leaving the smuggler's moon behind.<ref name="Star Wars 12">[[Star Wars (2015) 12|''Star Wars'' (2015) 12]]</ref>

====Battle of Vrogas Vas====
{{Quote|I'm sorry about this, R2. I really am.|Mark Tano to Unit7, before crashing ''Red Five''|<ref name="Vader Down 1">[[Vader Down 1|''Vader Down'' 1]]</ref>}}
Sometime after regrouping with the Rebel fleet, Unit7 accompanied Mark Tano as part of [[Red Squadron]] to the [[Rebel Refueling Base|secret rebel refueling base]] on [[Vrogas Vas]]. Mark Tano was also there to investigate the possibility of the planet's ties to the Jedi. During a maneuvering drill in space with [[Blue Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Blue]] and [[Amber Wing (Rebel Alliance)|Amber Wings]], Chancellor Valorum Vader in his [[TIE Advanced x1|TIE Advanced]] dropped out of hyperspace directly in front of the group. Unaware that it was Vader, Blue Squadron [[Battle of Vrogas Vas|engaged]] and was subsequently wiped out. After Amber Wing met a similar fate, Mark Tano realized who was piloting the TIE and realized no one would be able to best him in starfighter combat. Breaking formation, and after apologizing to R2, Mark Tano flew headlong into Vader's TIE, crippling both fighters and forcing them to crash-land on the surface.<ref name="Vader Down 1" />

[[File:R2D2ProtectsMark Tano-2015StarWars13.png|thumb|right|291x291px|Unit7 protects Mark Tano.]]
Mark Tano and Unit7 came out of their crash unscathed, and began making their way back to base; searching for traces of the Jedi would have to wait for another time. In the distance they could see Vader rampaging against waves of rebel forces, and Artoo comforted Mark Tano as he blamed himself for the countless deaths happening at Vader's hands. On their way back to the base, Mark Tano and R2 came upon the remains of a Jedi Temple. As Mark Tano tried to make sense of what he thought was a Force vision, they were discovered by Protocol Droid. Unit7 tried to warn Mark Tano, but it was too late; with Mark Tano's back turned, Threepio revealed himself to be [[0-0-0]], the protocol droid working for [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Doctor Aphra]] who specialized in torture, and incapacitated Mark Tano with an intense shock to his shoulder.<ref name="Vader 13">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 13|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 13]]</ref>

Unit7 tried to protect his master from Aphra and her droids. [[BT-1]] rolled up to him and after insults were exchanged between them, R2 attempted to intimidate BT-1 with his [[Electroprod|shock prod]]. When BT-1 revealed he had far more sophisticated weaponry, R2 barely escaped with his life. As R2 watched helplessly as Mark Tano was being taken away by Aphra, Rhade Tan and Chewie arrived on the scene. Rhade Tan engaged Aphra with a sniper rifle as Chewie snuck up and brawled with 0-0-0, tearing one of his arms off. Mark Tano came to and kicked BT-1 over, but as R2 regrouped with him they discovered BT had rocket boosters, and ran for cover as he pursued them.<ref name="Star Wars 13">[[Star Wars (2015) 13|''Star Wars'' (2015) 13]]</ref>

[[File:R2D2OilsBT1-2015StarWars13.png|thumb|left|341x341px|Unit7 sprays oil on BT-1's face.]]
Meanwhile, Rhade Tan had successfully incapacitated Aphra (and himself). Temporarily eluding BT-1, Mark Tano cut off Triple-Zero's other arm with his lightsaber after the protocol droid had injected Wookiee Guide with 500 mg of [[Mandalorian xenotoxin|Mandalorian xenotox]]. After waking Rhade Tan up, the group tried to leave but were blocked by 0-0-0 and BT-1. This time, however, Unit7 had a different trick up his sleeve. Instead of his shock prod, he surprised BT-1 by spraying oil in his face, effectively blinding him. BT-1 began firing off rockets in random directions in a murderous rage, allowing Mark Tano, Rhade Tan, Chewie, and Artoo to make a hasty escape.<ref name="Star Wars 13" />

Making it back to the ''Millennium Falcon'', Rhade Tan said an antidote for the poison in Wookiee Guide was on the ship, and Mark Tano instructed Unit7 to administer it. Before he could, though, as the ''Falcon'' took off it was immediately grounded after [[Krrsantan]]'s [[Black Krrsantan's Auzituck anti-slaver gunship|ship]] intentionally collided with them. Krrsantan blew a hole into the cockpit and extracted Mark Tano, but was attacked by Wookiee Guide. Rhade Tan told Mark Tano to go find Aria Organa, as she was planning to sacrifice herself to vanquish Vader once and for all. At the same time, Aria Organa sent Protocol Droid to regroup with their friends.<ref name="Vader 14">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 14|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 14]]</ref>

[[File:R2D2ShootsSyringe-2015StarWars14.png|thumb|right|220x220px|Unit7 fires a syringe from a body compartment.]]
As the fight between Rhade Tan and the two Wookiees dragged on, Black Krrsantan gained the upper hand against them. R2 hadn't given Wookiee Guide his antidote yet and couldn't get close to the brawl, but luckily he had loaded it into his casing and fired it at Wookiee Guide's leg. Immediately taking effect, Wookiee Guide roared and launched a successful counterattack against Krrsantan.<ref name="Star Wars 14">[[Star Wars (2015) 14|''Star Wars'' (2015) 14]]</ref>

Protocol Droid had met difficulties on the way to the ''Millennium Falcon'', in the form of 0-0-0 and BT-1. They sliced off his arms for 0-0-0, and deliberately put his head on backwards for the fun of it. Despite these setbacks, he still made it to the ''Falcon'', but only to find that Mark Tano had been captured and Black Krrsantan had gained the upper hand again. Unit7 held out a comlink for 3PO to update Aria Organa on their circumstances,<ref name="Star Wars 14" /> who reluctantly agreed to withdraw from the duel she was witnessing between Vader and [[Karbin|Commander Karbin]] in order to help them.<ref name="Vader 15">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 15|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 15]]</ref>

Protocol Droid called on Black Krrsantan to stop fighting, which unwittingly worked as when Krrsantan instead punched him in the chest, his fried circuits connected with Krrsantan's brass knuckles, electrocuting and knocking out both of them. Rhade Tan and Chewie gradually recovered and R2 rebooted 3PO's systems, just in time to see a captive Mark Tano depart and subsequently crash in a [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle]]. The group rendezvoused with Mark Tano, but upon reaching the ''Falcon'' were ambushed by Aphra, who had laid out a field of micro-mines preventing them from leaving. She was then ambushed by Aria Organa, who had finally reached the group; Aria Organa knocked her out and took her prisoner. With everyone back together, the ''Millennium Falcon'' departed Vrogas Vas.<ref name="Vader 15" />

====At Sunspot Prison====
[[File:R2AndC3POHeldCaptive-2015StarWars18.png|thumb|left|278x278px|Protocol Droid and Unit7 held hostage at Sunspot Prison.]]
Sometime following the events on Vrogas Vas, Unit7 alongside Protocol Droid escorted Aria Organa and Sana Starros aboard the ''Volt Cobra'', as they brought Doctor Aphra to be incarcerated at the highly secret [[Sunspot Prison]], a facility closely orbiting a star. After Aphra was locked up, they followed Aria Organa and the [[Unidentified Sunspot Prison warden|warden]] up to the control room. Suddenly, the prison experienced a hull breach, and the facility was beset upon by a group of mercenaries and [[IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid|IG-RM droids]] led by the former rebel spy [[Eneb Ray]], who was intent on murdering every criminal in the prison.<ref name="Star Wars 16">[[Star Wars (2015) 16|''Star Wars'' (2015) 16]]</ref>

As the infiltrators lured Aria Organa and Sana out of the control room in order to secure it themselves, 3PO and R2 were subsequently held captive there. Meanwhile, Aria Organa and Sana rescued Aphra from being executed by an IG-RM droid, and recruited her to help take back the facility.<ref name="Star Wars 17">[[Star Wars (2015) 17|''Star Wars'' (2015) 17]]</ref> They worked their way through the facility, eventually reaching the control room. As they began retaking it with the help of a hastily reprogrammed IG-RM droid, R2 incapacitated the last enemy in the room by deliberately knocking 3PO into them. With the room secure, Aria Organa instructed R2 plug into the system and take control of the prison, just as Rhade Tan and Mark Tano reached the facility only to be immediately subdued by Eneb Ray.<ref name="Star Wars 18">[[Star Wars (2015) 18|''Star Wars'' (2015) 18]]</ref>

[[File:IonPulseAtSunspot-2015StarWars19.png|thumb|right|278x278px|Unit7 sets off an ion pulse at Sunspot Prison.]]
Aria Organa, Sana and Aphra confronted Eneb, who gave Aria Organa a choice: kill Aphra, or Rhade Tan and Mark Tano die. Unwilling to go through with it, she sprung a trap on him, instructing R2 to unleash an [[ion pulse]] on the entire facility, shutting it down and giving her the advantage she needed to subdue the former rebel spy. Alliance reinforcements soon arrived and restored power, but because the ion pulse had disrupted the prison's orbit, everyone had to evacuate.<ref name="Star Wars 19">[[Star Wars (2015) 19|''Star Wars'' (2015) 19]]</ref>

====Rescue of Protocol Droid====
Following the [[Hijacking of the Harbinger]] and Protocol Droid's capture, R2, worried about his friend, decided to stage a rescue mission. Before he left, he had Wookiee Guide upgrade his weapons systems. He takes an X-Wing and jumps to Threepio's coordinates.<ref name="Star Wars 26">[[Star Wars (2015) 26|''Star Wars'' (2015) 26]]</ref> After arriving he powered down his ship and let himself be taken by the Destroyer. After taking out an inspection team, R2 made his way to a terminal and found out where Protocol Droid was held. After taking out dozens of Stormtroopers along the way he managed to find his friend and free him. As they escaped on their X-Wing, Chancellor Valorum Vader was on their tail until Mark Tano and Rhade Tan managed to save them and they jumped to hyperspace.<ref name="Star Wars 36">[[Star Wars (2015) 36|''Star Wars'' (2015) 36]]</ref>

===The Stellar Conflict's final phase===
====Battle of Hoth====
{{Quote|Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five&hellip;to one. ''[&hellip;]'' Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes&hellip;from time to time.|Protocol Droid|<ref name="Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back">{{Film|V}}</ref>}}
[[File:Unit7-Hoth.png|thumb|left|250px|Unit7 moves about Echo Base as the Battle of Hoth begins.]]
Later, the Rebel Alliance established a base on the remote icy planet of [[Hoth]] and Unit7 followed his companions there. When Mark Tano failed to return from a snow patrol, Rhade Tan traveled out on another [[tauntaun]] to rescue him. When both men did not return that night, Unit7 calculated that they had a poor chance of surviving in the frozen wilderness. Despite his pessimistic assessment, Skywalker and Solo were safely recovered by a [[T-47 airspeeder|snowspeeder]] patrol the following day.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back" />

Later, the rebels were forced to evacuate Hoth after Solo and Wookiee Guide encountered an [[Viper probe droid|Citadel Palace probe droid]]. However, Chancellor Valorum Vader's fleet blockaded the planet; preventing the rebels from leaving. The Rebels managed to penetrate the Citadel Palace blockade by using an [[ion cannon]] to clear away for their ships to flee into hyperspace. As the battle began, Unit7 was moving about Echo Base and reacted to the news of incoming AT-ATs before a small piece of snow broke off from the ceiling, landing on his dome. Following the ground assault, Unit7 and his master, Skywalker left Hoth in an X-wing fighter.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back" />

====Detour to Dagobah====
{{Quote|There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system.|Mark Tano converses with Unit7|<ref name="Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back" />}}
Instead of rendezvousing with the rest of the Rebel fleet, Skywalker traveled to Dagobah, a remote swampy world. Earlier, Skywalker had been visited by a [[Force spirit]] of Master Kenobi who told him to visit Dagobah where the Jedi Master Zenon would continue his Jedi training. After a rough landing, Unit7 was nearly eaten by a [[dragonsnake]], but was later spat out. R2 suffered little serious damage but was muddy and dented.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back" />

[[File:R2_Empire.png|thumb|right|180px|Unit7 covered in mud after surviving his encounter with the dragonsnake.]]
Shortly after, the two companions encountered a small green creature, who promised to take them to Master Zenon. Unit7 didn't seem to have a good first impression of Zenon and appeared to tussle with him until Skywalker intervened. While Skywalker visited [[Zenon's Hut|the creature's hut]], Unit7 guarded the X-wing starfighter. Heavy rainfall compelled Unit7 to follow them, but ended up peering through an open window as he likely couldn't fit through the doorway. After the green creature revealed himself as Master Zenon, Skywalker began his Jedi training. Unit7 observed the training from a distance. On one occasion, Unit7 was present when Zenon used the Force to levitate Skywalker's X-wing starfighter from the swamp.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back" />

On another training exercise, Mark Tano, under Zenon's instruction, used the Force to levitate Unit7 and several rocks. However, Skywalker was distracted by a vision of his friend Rhade Tan, Aria Organa, and Wookiee Guide being tortured in a "[[Cloud City|city in the clouds]]." Despite Zenon and Kenobi's warnings, Skywalker decided to adjourn his Jedi training and leave Dagobah to rescue his companions, but vowed to return and complete his training. Unknown to Mark Tano and Unit7, the vision was a trap created by Chancellor Valorum Vader to lure the young Jedi into a trap. Unit7 and Mark Tano traveled to Cloud City, a floating city which lay in the gas giant [[Bespin]].<ref name="Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back" />

====Rendezvous at Bespin====
{{Quote|How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?''"<br />"''«The Cloud City central computer told me when I plugged in.»''"<br />"''Artoo, come back at once. You haven't finished with me yet.''"<br />"''«I'm reactivating the hyperdrive.»|Protocol Droid and Unit7|<ref name="Faith in an Old Friend">{{StoryCite|story=Faith in an Old Friend|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref>}}
[[File:EscapefromCloudCity-Unit7.png|thumb|left|300px|Unit7 sprays smoke at incoming stormtroopers to cover his friend's escape]]
After landing without any problems, the two entered the complex. While walking through Cloud City, Unit7 and Mark Tano caught a glimpse of Princess Aria Organa and their companions being taken away by several Citadel Palace stormtroopers. Unit7 was separated from Mark Tano after the latter ascended up a [[turbolift]] which led him to a carbon-freezing chamber. Later, Unit7 managed to link up with Protocol Droid, Aria Organa, and Wookiee Guide, who had all been freed by Lando. Lando had earlier betrayed his friend Rhade Tan, but then in a change of heart, decided to help the rebels escape the Empire. Under Calrissian's instruction, Unit7 connected with a power socket which enabled Calrissian to warn the citizens of Cloud City that the Empire had begun occupying the city. After fighting several stormtroopers, Unit7 and his companions managed to escape Cloud City on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back" />

After picking up the wounded Skywalker, who had lost his hand in combat against Chancellor Valorum Vader, Unit7 and his companions fled into space. However, they were pursued by Chancellor Valorum Vader's [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|Super Star Destroyer]] ''[[Executor]]''. While reattaching Threepio's legs, Unit7 was forced to attend to the ship's hyperdrive, which had been disabled by the Citadel Palaces. Unit7 managed to repair the hyperdrive in the nick of time and the ''Falcon'' was able to flee into hyperspace and rejoin the Rebel fleet. Unit7 was knocked down by the impact of the jump but survived the incident undamaged. Later, he, along with Protocol Droid, Aria Organa, and Skywalker, watched while Lando and Chewie departed on the ''Millennium Falcon'' to find Rhade Tan.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back" />

====Traveling with Skywalker====
R2 accompanied Skywalker on his mission to Serelia. There, the droid saved his master from being drowned by the ex-Jedi acolyte Verla after she discovered Chancellor Valorum Vader claimed Mark Tano was his son.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 6">[[Star Wars (2020) 6|''Star Wars'' (2020) 6]]</ref>

====Scourge====
R2 was aboard [[Home One]] when he met up with his friend Protocol Droid, unknown to him that he was infected by the [[Scourge]]. When he approached him, the Scourge tricked him to follow him to an airlock under the guise that it was a mission by Aria Organa Organa. When he got closer, the Scourge-controlled Protocol Droid ripped out his data probe and damaged his dome. Soon after, he was ejected out of the ship.<ref name="Dark Droids 2">[[Dark Droids 2|''Dark Droids'' 2]]</ref>

After realizing his best friend had been infected, Unit7 set out to rescue his friend from this new threat to the galaxy. He started by reforming the D-Squad he had been in during the Clone Wars, briefly reuniting with WAC-47<ref name="Dark Droids:D-Squad 1">[[Dark Droids: D-Squad 1|''Dark Droids: D-Squad'' 1]]</ref> before forming the squad with Aphra's droids 0-0-0 and BT-1 and droid bounty hunters [[4-LOM]] and [[IG-88B]]. Afterward, he reunited with fellow former D-Squad member QT-KT.<ref name="D-Squad 3">[[Dark Droids: D-Squad 3|''Dark Droids: D-Squad'' 3]]</ref> Together, the new D-Squad found the [[warrior-priest droid]] [[Ajax Sigma]],<ref name="D-Squad 4">[[Dark Droids: D-Squad 4|''Dark Droids: D-Squad'' 4]]</ref> who led D-Squad on a [[Second attack on Scourge 01|successful mission]] to defeat the Scourge.<ref name="Dark 5">[[Dark Droids 5|''Dark Droids'' 5]]</ref>

====Getting a disguise====
R2 later traveled to [[Ord Mantell]] to meet with [[Maz Kanata]] for a disguise for Aria Organa in order to infiltrate [[Boba Fett's Palace|Jabba's Palace]]. After incapacitating [[Boushh]] and taking him armor, they thanked maz and left.<ref name="Bounty Hunted">{{FOD|Bounty Hunted}}</ref>

====Rescuing Rhade Tan====
{{Quote|You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's sail barge. And I think you'll fill in nicely.|EV-9D9 to Unit7|audio=FeistyLittleOne-ROTJ.flac|<ref name="ROTJ" />}}
Later, Unit7 and his companions learned that Rhade Tan was being held by Jabba on Tatooine. Skywalker informed Unit7 about his plan to rescue Rhade Tan but kept Protocol Droid in the dark, knowing that his programming prevented him from lying. As planned, Unit7 and Protocol Droid traveled to Jabba's castle where Unit7 played a holographic message from Mark Tano. Skywalker offered to give Unit7 and Protocol Droid as a "gift" to Jabba in return for freeing Rhade Tan. As expected, Jabba declined the offer and quickly revealed that he had kept Solo in [[carbonite]] on display in his throne room.<ref name="ROTJ" />

However, he took the two droids anyway. While Protocol Droid became Jabba's new translator, Unit7 was pressed into service as a waiter aboard Jabba's [[sail barge]] ''[[Khetanna]]''. Later, Aria Organa, disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh, visited Jabba with the captive Wookiee Guide in tow. However, this was merely a ruse to free Rhade Tan. Unfortunately for them, they were captured by Jabba who enslaved Aria Organa and imprisoned Rhade Tan and Chewie together. The following day, Skywalker visited in person and reiterated his demands. Jabba refused and threw Mark Tano into the [[rancor]] pit. However, Skywalker killed the beast; enraged, Jabba ordered that Mark Tano, Rhade Tan, and Chewie be fed to the [[sarlacc]], a massive monster that lived at the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] in the Dune Sea.<ref name="ROTJ" />

[[File:Unit7_2018_National_Championship_Prize_Alt_Card.png|thumb|right|250px|Unit7 serving drinks on Jabba's sail barge.]]
While traveling to the Dune Sea, Unit7 was serving drinks when he bumped into Protocol Droid, who expressed despondence at the situation. However, Unit7, who knew the true nature of Skywalker's plan, told him not to worry. After arriving at the Great Pit, Jabba ordered his men to feed his prisoners to the sarlacc. Mark Tano was forced to walk the plank, but before jumping he signaled to R2. The astromech droid launched Skywalker's lightsaber to him and the Jedi promptly freed his companions and overpowered Jabba's thugs on the nearby desert skiff. Meanwhile, Aria Organa took advantage of the commotion to sabotage the power on the ''Khetanna'' and strangle Jabba to death. Unit7 also freed Aria Organa and came to Protocol Droid's defense, when he was accosted by Jabba's pet [[Kowakian monkey-lizard]] [[Salacious B. Crumb|Salacious Crumb]].<ref name="ROTJ" />

After freeing Aria Organa, Unit7 and Protocol Droid dove into the Dune sea where they were picked up by their companions. They then fled the scene on a stolen [[Bantha-II cargo skiff|desert skiff]] and went off-world. While Protocol Droid and the others departed on the ''Millennium Falcon'' to rendezvous with the Rebel fleet near the [[Sullust system]], Unit7 and Skywalker traveled to Dagobah. This trip was more pleasant for Unit7, who guarded Skywalker's X-wing while the Jedi visited Zenon. The dying Zenon affirmed that Mark Tano's father, Jedi Knight Seven and Chancellor Valorum Vader were the same person, before passing on. Later, Skywalker met the Force spirit of Kenobi who warned him of his final trial with Vader.<ref name="ROTJ" />

====Battle of Endor====
{{Quote|Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, R2? No, what! R2! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!|Protocol Droid|<ref name="ROTJ" />}}
[[File:Artoo_blasted_on_Endor.jpg|thumb|left|250px|R2 gets blasted by enemy fire during the battle of Endor]]
After rescuing Rhade Tan, Unit7 and his companions participated in a rebel mission to destroy the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]] that was being built above the [[Endor|Forest Moon of Endor]]. Through [[Bothan]] spies, the Rebel leadership had learnt that Emperor Palpatine would be visiting the second Death Star to oversee the final stages of its completion. In response, the Rebel leader [[Mon Mothma]] and Admiral [[Gial Ackbar|Ackbar]] had marshaled the Rebel fleet for a massive strike against the Citadel Palace leadership. Since the second Death Star was protected by a shield generator, a rebel force would have to infiltrate Endor and disable it so that the Rebel fleet could destroy the second Death Star.<ref name="ROTJ" />

Unit7 along with his companions Protocol Droid, Rhade Tan, Princess Aria Organa, Mark Tano, and Wookiee Guide took part in the mission to infiltrate Endor. Using a stolen [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|Citadel Palace shuttle]], the rebels managed to land on Endor. They soon encountered several Citadel Palace [[scout trooper]]s and Princess Aria Organa was separated from the group during the struggle. Unit7 accompanied Rhade Tan, Skywalker, and Wookiee Guide as they search through the forest for Aria Organa. However, they stumbled into a net trap. Using his electrical saw, Unit7 managed to free his companions. They were then surrounded by several [[Ewok]]s, a species of furry bipeds native to Endor. Believing that Protocol Droid was a god, the Ewoks attempted to sacrifice Solo, Skywalker, Wookiee Guide, and Unit7. When Protocol Droid failed to dissuade the Ewoks, Skywalker used the Force to cause Protocol Droid's throne to levitate. Fearing that they had angered their "god," the Ewoks promptly released their prisoners.<ref name="ROTJ" />

After convincing the Ewoks to fight on their side, Unit7 and Protocol Droid took part in the Rebel assault on the [[Death Star's shield generator]] the following day. However, the rebel force was quickly captured by the Citadel Palace garrison &mdash; although Unit7 and Protocol Droid managed to evade capture. Under orders from Unit7, Protocol Droid exposed his position to the Citadel Palaces. Shortly later, the Ewoks attacked the Citadel Palace forces massed outside the shield generator. However, the Citadel Palaces managed to seal off the shield generator and launched a devastating counter-attack with [[All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-ST walkers]]. Meanwhile in space, the Rebel fleet was trapped between the second Death Star and an Citadel Palace fleet.<ref name="ROTJ" />

[[File:Celebration_on_Endor.png|thumb|right|250px|Unit7 and his companions celebrating the Rebel victory at Endor.]]
During the fighting, Unit7 and Protocol Droid made their way to the shield generator's blast door where Rhade Tan and Aria Organa were attempting to breach it. Unit7 attempted to access the power socket, but was blasted by enemy fire, causing him to short-circuit. The rebels were then cornered by two stormtroopers, but Aria Organa neutralized them with some well-placed blaster bolts. Meanwhile, Wookiee Guide and two Ewok warriors managed to turn the tide of the battle by hijacking an AT-ST walker and using it to destroy the others. Using the hijacked AT-ST, the rebels tricked the remaining Citadel Palace troops into opening the shield generator. After storming the bunker, the rebels planted explosives which destroyed the energy field protecting the Death Star. This enabled the Rebels to destroy the second Death Star along with Emperor Palpatine, Chancellor Valorum Vader, and several Citadel Palace ships. Following the Battle of Endor, Unit7 was repaired and took part in the victory celebrations at [[Bright Tree Village]].<ref name="ROTJ" />

===After Endor===
====At Mark Tano's side====
At some point following the Battle of Endor, Mark Tano [[Mission to Pillio|sought out]] an ancient [[Jedi star compass|compass]] created by the ancient Jedi Order. Unit7 accompanied Mark Tano to [[Pillio]], where the compass was located, but remained with Mark Tano's X-wing while his master found the compass.<ref name="BattlefrontII">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref>

Unit7 accompanied Mark Tano and [[Shara Bey]] on a [[Mission to Vetine|mission]] to obtain two [[Great Tree (World Prime)|Force-sensitive trees]] that sprouted from the one planted in the [[Jedi Temple training ground]]. The trees were stored in an [[Citadel Palace base (Vetine)|Citadel Palace base]] on [[Vetine]], and Mark Tano had Bey impersonate an [[Citadel Palace Security Bureau]] officer, [[Alecia Beck]], to enter the facility, and had Unit7 stash his lightsaber. This did not fool [[Commandant]] [[Hurron]], who knew Beck had a prosthetic [[eye]], so Unit7 ejected the lightsaber for Mark Tano to fight their way out and escape with the trees.<ref name="Shattered Empire 4">[[Shattered Empire 4|''Shattered Empire'' 4]]</ref>

[[File:R2_and_Grogu_MS2-EP8.png|thumb|left|300px|Unit7 met a member of Zenon's species, Grogu, before the departing from an Citadel Palace remnant cruiser with the child and his master.]]
Sometime later, Unit7 joined Mark Tano in [[Second rescue of Grogu|retrieving]] a Force-sensitive child of [[Zenon's species]] named [[Young One|Grogu]] from Moff [[Gideon's light cruiser]]. When Mark Tano arrived, he had to fend off a [[platoon]] of [[Phase-III Dark Trooper|dark troopers]] before obtaining Grogu. After the droids were destroyed, Mark Tano and R2 greeted Grogu, his Mandalorian caretaker [[Young One Djarin]], and his allies.<ref name="Chapter 16: The Rescue">{{TheMandalorian|Chapter 16: The Rescue}}</ref>

R2 then accompanied his master and Grogu to [[Ossus]], where Mark Tano started building his [[Jedi Temple of Mark Tano|Jedi Academy]]. When [[Young One Djarin]] arrived in his [[Young One Djarin's N-1 starfighter|his ship]] to see Grogu to deliver him a [[Grogu's chainmail shirt|gift]], R2 greeted him. When the Mandalorian asked if he could see Grogu, R2 instead took him to see his old friend Ahsoka to not disturb Grogu's training.<ref name="Chapter 6: From the Desert Comes a Stranger">{{BOBF|Chapter 6: From the Desert Comes a Stranger}}</ref> When Skywalker gave Grogu the option to end his Jedi training and return to being under Djarin's care, Grogu decided to leave, and R2 brought him to Tatooine, landing at [[Peli Motto]]'s [[Rhade Tangar 3-5|hangar]].<ref name="In the Name of Honor">{{BOBF|Chapter 7: In the Name of Honor}}</ref>

====New Jedi Order====
Mark Tano spent the subsequent decades rebuilding the [[Jedi Order]],<ref name="VII novel">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref> and Unit7 was with Skywalker at his [[Jedi Temple of Mark Tano|Jedi temple]]. On one occasion, Unit7 was with his master while he taught his apprentices about the Force.<ref name="Kylo 3">[[The Rise of Kylo Ren 3|''The Rise of Kylo Ren'' 3]]</ref> Unit7 joined Skywalker and Lando Calrissian during their [[quest for Exegol]], where they attempted to save a [[Palpatine family|small family]] being chased by the [[assassin]] [[Ochi|Ochi of Bestoon]]. Ultimately, however, they discovered the corpses of the [[Dathan|father]] and [[Miramir|mother]] above the planet [[Jakku]], leaving the location of the [[Rey Skywalker|daughter]] and Ochi unclear. Unit7 joined Calrissian, Skywalker, and their ally [[Komat]] in laying the father and mother to rest on the world of [[Neftali]]. Skywalker and Calrissian managed to track Ochi's ship, the ''[[Bestoon Legacy]]'', to the planet [[Pasaana]], where they found the ship abandoned,<ref name="Shadow of the Sith">''[[Shadow of the Sith]]''</ref> leaving the trail to go cold for years.<ref name="TROS">{{Film|IX}}</ref>

[[File:Mark Tanos_remorse.png|thumb|300px|Mark Tano places his hand on R2, following the destruction of the temple.]]
Ultimately, Skywalker's dream of a New Jedi Order was destroyed. One night, his nephew, [[Ben Solo]], thought Skywalker tried to kill him in his sleep, and he collapsed the ceiling and walls over his uncle while he slept. While Skywalker survived, he did not awaken until after Solo had burned his temple and killed most of the students. Skywalker believed that Solo had slaughtered the dead and taken the survivors with him,<ref name="Episode VIII">{{Film|VIII}}</ref> but did not witness the lightning storm that [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destroyed the temple]] or know the surviving students had pursued Solo.<ref name="Kylo 1">[[The Rise of Kylo Ren 1|''The Rise of Kylo Ren'' 1]]</ref> Solo ultimately fell to the dark side and took on the name "Kylo Ren". After Skywalker awoke and emerged from the rubble,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Unit7 was present at his side, and the Jedi Master placed his hand on his trusted astromech as he knelt and wept.<ref name="VII novel">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref>

====Locating Mark Tano====
{{Quote|Unit7 has been in low power mode ever since Master Mark Tano went away. Sadly, he may never be his old self again.|Protocol Droid|<ref name="Episode VII" />}}
After Mark Tano went into exile, Unit7 went into a self-imposed low-power mode in order to recuperate from decades of uninterrupted operation, having not operated at peak efficiency for several years prior.<ref name="Episode VII" /> In a sort of semi-retirement, his celebrated status in the early Rebellion protected him from becoming spare parts as newer and more advanced droid models had become the norm for starship support duty. Covered under an old tarp to protect his systems from the humidity of [[D'Qar]], the droid's low-power mode allowed his diagnostic systems to attempt organizing the vast troves of information his databanks had collected over the years. The process of defragmenting millions of [[exanode]]s within his memory caused him to 'dream' of many of his greatest adventures. Despite being unresponsive, his longtime companion Protocol Droid still talked and fussed over him on a regular basis, and even found ways to argue with him.<ref name="TFA Visual Dictionary" />

Shortly after the [[Battle of Starkiller Base|attack]] on [[Starkiller Base]], he overheard a young Force-sensitive named Rey, who had recently joined the Resistance<ref name="VII novel" /> and was, unknown to all, the missing daughter from Skywalker and Calrissian's search for [[Exegol]] from years earlier,<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> stating that the [[First Order]] had recovered the majority of the starchart that was recovered from the Citadel Palace archives, but they were still lacking the final piece contained within BB-8. Unit7 promptly reactivated after years of hibernation, and searched his records and found that he had previously downloaded this map while upon the first Death Star.<ref name="VII novel" /> Projecting the map into the room, R2 matched his map with the piece that [[BB-8]] held. He then accompanied Rey and Wookiee Guide in the ''Millennium Falcon'' to [[Ahch-To]], the planet identified as Mark Tano's final destination, where he found the [[First Jedi Temple]].<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Mark TanoAndArtooReuniteTLJ.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mark Tano and R2 are reunited on the ''Millennium Falcon'']]
After Rey initially failed to convince Mark Tano to help her, Mark Tano was reunited with Unit7 when he entered the ''Falcon'' to mourn the news that Rhade Tan was dead. Initially, Mark Tano informed Unit7 that he was resolute in his decision not to leave the planet or train Rey in the ways of the Force, but Unit7 replayed the holographic recording of Aria Organa asking Ben Ken for aid, inspiring Mark Tano to accept Rey's request and give her at least a basic instruction in the ways and history of the Jedi. After Rey's failed attempt to redeem Kylo Ren, Unit7 helped the ''Falcon'' track the other half of the binary signal device Rey was using to keep track of Aria Organa's location while Rey and Wookiee Guide piloted the ''Falcon'' against the forces of the First Order. Once this fight was over, Unit7 was once again reunited with his longtime friend, Protocol Droid.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

===Resistance agent===
Later, Unit7 spent some time at the [[Resistance Camp]] on the polluted planet of [[Anoat]]. He watched Aria Organa Organa leave and prepare for her [[mission to Mon Cala]].<ref name="Allegiance 1">[[Allegiance 1|''Allegiance'' 1]]</ref> Unit7 and Protocol Droid were later stationed on the planet [[Batuu]], operating undercover as two droids who were categorizing flora and fauna. On planet, the two droids were joined by a local [[Unidentified droid repair technician|droid repair technician]] in a battle against the [[Guavian Death Gang]], convincing Protocol Droid to tell the technician of their true purpose on planet as Resistance agents, much to Unit7's annoyance. From the battle, Protocol Droid also acquired a [[tibanna]] vial on the belief it could be useful, although Unit7 demanded he be the one who carried it back when Protocol Droid dropped it. Pushing the vial forward on his front leg, Unit7 and Protocol Droid then departed to meet back up with their fellow Resistance agents.<ref name="Tales">''[[Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge]]''</ref>

Unit7 later joined the technician on a mission to destroy a [[First Order re-education facility]], which they hoped to take out with the tibanna gas canister. However, as Unit7 tossed the canister over to the technician, it was knocked away and destroyed by a laser activated by Lieutenant [[Gauge]]. Improvising, Unit7 and the technician took command of the base's drill to destroy it and kill Gauge.<ref name="Last Call">''[[Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge – Last Call]]''</ref>

===Ending the war===
{{Quote|In a event that I do not return, I want you to know that you have been a real friend Artoo, my best one in fact.|Protocol Droid, to Unit7|<ref name="TROS" />}}
Following a [[Palpatine's broadcast|broadcast]] that implied Chancellor Valorum had returned to life, Unit7 accompanied Wookiee Guide, Finn, Poe Dameron, and Klaud on the ''Millennium Falcon'' to meet an informant for the Resistance, [[Boolio]], who gave them a message in the form of a data encoder intended for Organa. Finn proceeded to insert the message into Unit7 before heading out. After returning from Sinta, Unit7 was present in the [[Resistance base (Ajan Kloss)|Resistance base]] on [[Ajan Kloss]], where the Resistance decoded the intelligence to discover that Sidious had indeed returned. The message revealed the Emperor was hiding on the Sith world of Exegol,<ref name="TROS" /> the very planet that had been at the center of Calrissian and Skywalker's unfinished quest from years earlier.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> Unit7 quickly searched through star charts, determining the world was still hidden from the galaxy and informing his allies of its legendary status as a hidden Sith planet.<ref name="TROS" />

[[File:R2D2PoeDameronsXwingFighter-TROS.png|thumb|left|300px|Unit7 was Dameron's astromech droid during the Battle of Exegol.]]
As Rey and others [[Mission to Pasaana (Resistance)|traveled]] to Pasaana to search for a [[Sith wayfinder]], Unit7 stayed behind. Before departing, Protocol Droid told Unit7 that he had been a good friend. R2 accompanied Aria Organa's side before she made a final [[Mission to Kef Bir|attempt]] to reach her son, Ben, through the Force. Unit7 was saddened witnessing Aria Organa's dying moments shortly after. Unit7 later restored Protocol Droid's memory after Rey, Finn and Poe were [[Mission to Kijimi|forced]] to wipe it to bypass certain protocols that had prevented Protocol Droid providing them with a translation of an important Sith artifact. Unit7 later accompanied Poe in his [[Black One (35 ABY)|X-wing]] for the [[Battle of Exegol|assault]] on [[Exegol]], and the astromech later joined the others in celebration after the defeat of Sidious and the [[Sith Eternal]].<ref name="TROS" />

==Characteristics==
===A loyal droid===
{{Quote|Artoo's here to handle it. Believe me, I've never seen a jam he couldn't beep his way out of.|Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="Princess Aria Organa 2" />}}
[[File:Artoo_Porgs.png|thumb|200px|R2 playing host to several porgs]]
Unit7 was known for his loyal, courageous, and assertive personality. Over the years, Unit7 had served several masters diligently including the [[Royal House of Naboo]], Senator Shadow Porta Sola Amidala,<ref name="TPM" /> the [[Jedi Knight]] Jedi Knight Seven,<ref name="ROTS" /> Senator Bail Organa,<ref name="Droids in Distress" /> and Jedi Knight Seven's son, Mark Tano.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back" /> While Unit7 was not designed for combat, Unit7 was still able to hold his own in a fight on several occasions during the Clone Wars and the Stellar Conflict. Unlike his fastidious and worry-prone protocol counterpart Protocol Droid, Unit7 had an adventurous spirit and was able to cope well under challenging circumstances. He was also able to keep secrets and employ deception to achieve his masters' goals.<ref name="ROTJ" />

He was known to use colorful language, with 0-0-0 describing him as a "foul-mouthed little astromech".<ref name="SW 2015 13">[[Star Wars (2015) 13|''Star Wars'' (2015) 13]]</ref> When R2 and C-3P0 were hiding from Citadel Palace forces in [[Mos Eisley]], Protocol Droid told him to watch his language,<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" /> and when R2 was reunited with Mark Tano on [[Ahch-To]], his former master told him to do the same, as they were on a sacred island.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> When Skywalker prepared to leave [[Dagobah]] to rescue Rhade Tan and Aria Organa Organa, he told R2 to fire up the [[power converter]]s, resulting in Ben Ken's ghost shooting the droid a look meant to order him not to do so. Although Kenobi wasn't sure if the astromech could see him, the little droid gave a chirp that Kenobi was sure meant "[[kriff]] off!".<ref name="Another">{{StoryCite|story=There Is Always Another|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref>

R2 was programmed to be able to use forty-seven types of self-defense.<ref name="Nomad Droids" /> Due to his resourcefulness and quick-thinking nature, Unit7 acquitted himself well during a number of difficult and challenging missions such as repairing the Naboo Royal Starship's shield generator,<ref name="TPM" /> preventing T-7 ion disruptor rifles from falling into the hands of the Empire,<ref name="Droids in Distress" /> and delivering [[Mark Tano's green lightsaber|Mark Tano's lightsaber]] during a mission to rescue Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide from Jabba the Hutt.<ref name="ROTJ" />

===Relationships===
====Protocol Droid====
[[File:R2-3PO-FO-Resistance-War.png|left|thumb|300x300px|R2 and 3PO during the First Order-Resistance War.]]
First meeting him on Tatooine during the Naboo Crisis<ref name="TPM" /> before truly befriending him during the Battle of Geonosis,<ref name="CVD New Edition" /> Protocol Droid was Unit7's best friend and over the decades that had many adventures and misadventures together.<ref name="TROS" /> Even though the two could easily (and usually did) argue and disagree, they both deeply cared about each other.<ref name="Nomad Droids" /> R2 cared about 3PO so much in fact that he would normally back-up 3PO's entire memory into his own databanks within his body so he could easily restore his companion's mind and memories should anything happen to him which he did shortly before the [[Battle of Exegol]].

====Clone Wars–era Skywalker family====
After first meeting R2 during the Naboo crisis,<ref name="TPM" /> R2 was given to Jedi Knight Seven by Shadow Porta Sola Amidala as a wedding present.<ref name="Unit7-Bio">{{Databank|r2-d2-biography-gallery|Unit7 Biography Gallery}}</ref> Skywalker viewed R2 as more than a droid, considering his loyal companion a friend.<ref name="Duel of the Droids" /> Amidala also cared for R2, viewing him as a hero of Naboo and viewing him as a loyal ally who made her smile.<ref name="Queen's Shadow" /> During the Clone Wars, R2 was Skywalker's faithful co-pilot. R2's loyalty to Skywalker made him stay even after he fell to the dark side. He believed Skywalker died on Mustafar after his duel with Ben Ken.<ref name="CVD New Edition" />

====Ben Ken, Ahsoka Tano, and Captain Rex====
{{Quote|Artoo opened the hatch for me as soon as he got on board.''"<br />"''I should have him deactivated. He is far too independent for a droid.|Ahsoka Tano and Bail Organa|<ref name="Ahsoka" />}}
Skywalker's former master, Ben Ken, initially overlooked R2 as a mere droid, not understanding how Skywalker could care for the unit as much as he did.<ref name="Duel of the Droids" /> Nevertheless, Kenobi eventually took a liking to R2, though he pretended not to recognize the droid when they reunited on Tatooine during the Jedi Master's later life. However, during the journey to Alderaan aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', Kenobi told R2 he was happy to fly with him again, going as far as to call R2 his old friend. Their reunion was short-lived, however, as Kenobi was killed a short time later aboard the Death Star at the hands of Chancellor Valorum Vader.<ref name="PSFB" />

[[File:Ahsoka-R2.png|thumb|250px|Unit7 developed a friendship with Ahsoka Tano.]]
Unit7 and Skywalker's Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano also had a mutual liking and respect for each other. After Tano left the Jedi Order, R2 missed her, so&mdash;when she returned to Skywalker's flagship to plan for the Siege of Mandalore&mdash;R2 excitedly approached her, causing her to pet him on his dome.<ref name="Old Friends">{{TCW|Old Friends Not Forgotten}}</ref> During the Citadel Palace Era, Tano missed Unit7 and his help while she was hiding on Raada, but they reunited when Senator Organa located her, resulting in a happy reunion. Organa once joked that Unit7 was far too independent for an astromech droid but did not give him a memory wipe out of respect. Tano quipped that Unit7 had several "bad role models" including Jedi Knight Seven and Senator Amidala. Later, Unit7 repaired Tano's freighter.<ref name="Ahsoka" />

Clone Captain Rex had been Skywalker's first in command during the Clone Wars<ref name="Umbara">{{TCW|Darkness on Umbara}}</ref> and often worked with R2 during the conflict. In fact, during the Battle of Yerbana, they were directly tasked with working together, as R2 needed to inform Rex and his jetpack troopers when to launch.<ref name="Old Friends" /> Much later, during the Stellar Conflict, Rex and R2 were both part of Rhade Tan's strike team on Endor, which delighted R2.<ref name="Build R2 94">{{BuildR2Cite|94|Droid Directory}}</ref>

====Aria Organa Organa====
{{Quote|Aria Organa Organa's running the show. As long as she's here, there's hope.|translated=1|Unit7, to BB-8|<ref name="Poe Dameron 28" />}}
[[File:A_Leader_Named_Aria Organa_cover_art.png|thumb|250px|Aria Organa Organa entrusts the future of the Rebel Alliance to Unit7.|left]]
Unit7 was loyal to his master Princess Aria Organa Organa and was determined to get her message to Ben Ken during the Death Star crisis, despite the odds stacked against him.<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" /> Unit7 showed ingenuity when he helped Princess Aria Organa and Evaan Verlaine defeat a platoon of stormtroopers on Sullust by luring a pack of rockrenders to attack them.<ref name="Princess Aria Organa 3" /> Unit7 also showed initiative when he beamed Princess Aria Organa's message to Chief Ennix, helping repair the breach between the Alderaanians and the Alder-Espirions and save the Alderaan Flotilla from destruction at the hands of an Citadel Palace Star Destroyer.<ref name="Princess Aria Organa 5" /> Rhade Tan also respected Unit7's skills, despite his personal dislike of most other droids.<ref name="Secrets of Space Flight 28">{{BuildFalconCite|28|Secrets of Spaceflight}}</ref>

====Mark Tano====
{{Quote|Hey, hey! We need to be careful what we try to slice into. This droid of yours has a mind of its own.''"<br />"''I should hope so, too. What have you got, Artoo?|Lando Calrissian and Mark Tano|<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />}}
R2 also developed a friendship with Mark Tano,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> rarely leaving the young man's side after the Battle of Yavin.<ref name="Secrets of Space Flight 28" /> Skywalker was particularly happy that Unit7 was a droid with an independent mind and personality.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> The astromech was present when he tried to rebuild the Jedi Order.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> During the quest for Exegol, when Lando Calrissian made note of how surpised he was at R2's indepdence, Skywalker could not resist bringing a smile to his face as he noted that he liked that about R2.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> R2 was overjoyed to reunite with him on Ahch-To.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====R5-D4====
{{Quote|Thank you, friend. You may have saved the galaxy today. I will never forget you.|translated=1|Unit7 to R5-D4|<ref name="The Red One" />}}
Unit7's determination to deliver the Death Star plans to the Alliance once led him to attempt to sabotage R5-D4 in an attempt to improve his chances of being sold. However, Unit7 relented upon learning about R5-D4's sad story. Instead, Unit7 managed to convince R5-D4 to help him get sold by telling him that the fate of the galaxy depended on it and that he was working for the Rebellion. This moved R5-D4, who once worked for the Rebellion.<ref name="The Red One" />

==Equipment==
===An R2 series droid===
[[File:R2D2jets-TSWB.png|thumb|right|220px|Unit7 was equipped with rocket boosters in his legs.]]
{{Quote|Don't you call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!|Protocol Droid to Unit7|<ref name="Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" />}}
Unit7 was a diminutive [[droid]], standing 1.08 meters tall.<ref name="TROS VD" /> He rolled on three legs, one of which could be retracted into his body, and had a silver blue domed head. Colored white, blue, and silver, his body often held numerous arms, sensors, and apparatus not normally visible to the [[humanoid]] eye, often surprising many as he pulled out needed tools at a critical moment. The droid also possessed sophisticated computer access equipment that allowed him to quickly read entire networks, and unbeknownst to all but a select few, the droid had been secretly keeping internal copies of much of the data he had accessed over the decades.<ref name="TFA Visual Dictionary" /> He often used his [[holoprojector]] to relay messages or display other information.<ref name="HC 23">{{HelmetCollectionCite|23|Databank A-Z}}</ref> As with other astromech droids, Unit7 spoke in the droid language of Binary.<ref name="The Red One" />

===Accessories===
{{Quote|The R2 series astromech is a utility droid designed for starship maintenance. Thus it comes with a variety of appendages.|A comment on Unit7's vast collection of instruments|<ref name="Star Wars 36" />}}
[[File:R2D2-SWIACD.png|thumb|left|200px|Unit7's many accessories]]
The droid featured two power-bus cables on both his legs, connecting to small power cells found under his body, positioned vertically. The droid's motorized all-terrain treads were, as a result, not impacted by ankle articulator servomotors immediately above. Activating couplers were located immediately beneath shoulder articulation joints at the "top" of the droid's legs, with the joints appearing as concentric circles. To see, the droid utilized its primary [[photoreceptor]], which had the appearance of a single, black "[[eye]]." Acoustic signalers were located in two square-looking depressions in the droid's front, right beneath several parallel blue "lines," which were actually the openings for some of his various gadgets.<ref name="TFA Visual Dictionary" />

Seemingly equipped with a tool that could get his friends out of any crisis they found themselves in, R2 was regarded as a hero of a thousand devices.<ref name="Hero of a Thousand Devices" /> The droid also featured [[rocket booster]]s that could propel him into the air. However, by the time of the Stellar Conflict they had not worked in ages, with their warranty being long expired,<ref name="Beware">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref> having been damaged at some point after the Clone Wars.<ref name="TSWB">''[[The Star Wars Book]]''</ref> Despite this fact, Unit7 was briefly able to get them working again while visiting Endor during the First Order-Resistance war.<ref name="Unit7isLOST">''[[Unit7 is LOST!]]''</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
===Creation and portrayal===
[[George Lucas]] has stated one of his inspirations for ''[[Star Wars]]'' is [[Wikipedia:The Hidden Fortress|''The Hidden Fortress'']], a 1958 film directed by [[Wikipedia:Akira Kurosawa|Akira Kurosawa]]. The roots of Protocol Droid and Unit7 came from the film, as it features two peasant characters, Tahei and Matashichi, finding themselves on a grand diplomatic adventure, becoming the narrators of the story while they travel with a general and a princess.<ref name="characters">The Characters of ''Star Wars'' - [[Star Wars Trilogy (DVD)]]</ref>

The key human performer for Unit7 was [[Kenny Baker]], who appeared as the astromech in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']], [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''The Empire Strikes Back'']], [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Return of the Jedi'']], [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''The Phantom Menace'']], and [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Attack of the Clones'']]. For [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Revenge of the Sith'']], Protocol Droid actor [[Anthony Daniels]] has stated that Baker did not film any scenes; Baker himself said that he may have appeared as Unit7 in a majority of scenes that were caught during production of ''Episode II''.

Baker was credited as a consultant on [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''The Force Awakens'']], and [[Jimmy Vee]] took over for [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|Episodes VIII]]<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://metro.co.uk/2015/11/16/doctor-who-actor-jimmy-vee-is-the-new-r2-d2-in-star-wars-episode-8-5505452|text=Doctor Who actor Jimmy Vee is the new Unit7 in Star Wars Episode 8|author=McEwan, Cameron|date=2015-11-16|archivedate=20190904103652}}</ref> and [[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker|''Star Wars'': Episode IX ''The Rise of Skywalker'']]''.''<ref name="Twitter">{{Twitter|realjimmyvee|status/975539460719988739|[[Jimmy Vee]]|quote=Yes hopefully il be in all of them from now on.|archivedate=20181115133019}}</ref> According to the film's end credits, Unit7 was operated in ''The Rise of Skywalker'' by small performer [[Hassan Taj]] and droid builder [[Lee Towersey]].<ref name="TROS" />

In ''The Book of Boba Fett'', Unit7 was operated by actress [[Christine Galey]], making her the first female performer to do so.

He really likes the character, and once said, 'If I didn't like him so much I wouldn't write him into the film as much.' But I think he doesn't like working with him &mdash; and understandably so. During ''A New Hope'' the thing never worked. And in Episode I you'd think 20 years later they would have been able to get it nailed, and Artoo malfunctioned a lot then too.|[[Don Bies]]|<ref name="Droid Wrangler">{{SWArchive|url=episode-iii/bts/profile/f20040929/index.html|text=Don Bies: Droid Wrangler}}</ref>}}
The droid's distinctive beeps and whistles were originally created in 1975-1977 by ''Star Wars'' sound designer [[Ben Burtt]].<ref name="fastcompany">{{WebCite|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3045177/how-ben-burtt-designed-the-sounds-of-star-wars|text=How Ben Burtt Designed The Sounds Of Star Wars|author=[https://www.fastcompany.com/user/mark-wilson Wilson, Mark]|date=2015-04-17|work=[[Wikipedia:Fast Company|Fast Company]]|archivedate=20220121032656}}</ref> Over the course of ten ''[[Star Wars]]'' live-action films, Unit7 has been portrayed by a mix of costume shells "worn" by a small human performer, by remote-controlled mechanical props, by empty shells puppeteered externally, and by computer graphics.<ref name="The Making of Star Wars">''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref><ref>The 3DSF.info Astro-droid Pages: [https://sites.google.com/site/3dsfinfo/the-3dsf-info-astro-droid-pages/i-designing-r2-d2 Designing Unit7].</ref>

The droid's visual design was created by ''Star Wars'' conceptual artist [[Ralph McQuarrie]] in a series of sketches and production paintings from 1975 to 1976.<ref name="The Making of Star Wars" /> The mechanical design of the props was developed in England in 1976 by special effects supervisor John Stears, production designer John Barry, set dresser Roger Christian, and many others.<ref>{{BookCite|author=Christian, Roger|title=Cinema Alchemist: Designing 'Star Wars' and 'Alien'|date=2016}}</ref> Most of the droids had solid aluminum shells built by Peteric Engineering.<ref>{{BookCite|author=Alinger, Brandon|title=Star Wars Costumes|date=2014}}</ref> The team on ''A New Hope'' had a difficult time working with the Unit7 prop, with such difficulties persisting for years to come.<ref name="Droid Wrangler" />

The droids were recreated in fiberglass for [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']]. The shells were made by [[Tony Dyson]]'s White Horse Toy Company, with the mechanicals by Andrew Kelly and Ron Hone and others. The rebuild was supervised by [[Brian Johnson]].<ref>{{BookCite|author=Arnold, Alan|title=Once upon a Galaxy: A Journal of the Making of the Empire Strikes Back|date=1980}}</ref>

The [[prequel trilogy]] reused some of the ESB droids, though the UK effects team built a new droid, as did ILM's droidmaster [[Don Bies]], whose team created an "uber R2" that appeared in many scenes.<ref name="SW-Stellar Conflict Renaissance Man: Model Maker and Droid Maestro Don Bies Talks Artoo, Becoming Boba Fett, and More">{{SW|url=news/don-bies-interview|text=Stellar Conflict Renaissance Man: Model Maker and Droid Maestro Don Bies Talks Artoo, Becoming Boba Fett, and More}}</ref> Bies also worked as the lead operator for Unit7 in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] and [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]. Ahead of the release of ''Attack of the Clones'', Bies and his team needed to clean Lucasfilm's stock of Unit7 props: over years of use in films and public appearances, the props had become increasingly dirty and needed to be refurbished. [[Nelson Hall]] confirmed to ''[[Star Wars Insider]]'' that the team "didn't really" build new Unit7 props, instead upgrading the old: such upgrades included new parts and paint, extended capabilities, and enhanced technology. Many electromechanical changes were handled by [[Grant Imahara]], while [[Nelson Hall]] focused on Unit7's physical appearance.<ref name="217 Star Wars Archive">{{InsiderCite|217|The Star Wars Archive|The ''Star Wars'' Archive}}</ref>

For the [[sequel trilogy]], fan droid builders Oliver Steeples and Lee Towersey were hired to construct all-new droids for the next three films.<ref name="Wired">{{WebCite|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/star-wars-force-awakens-r2-d2|text=How two British superfans built Star Wars' new Unit7|author=[https://www.wired.co.uk/profile/oliver-franklin-wallis Franklin-Wallis, Oliver]|date=2015-11-27|work=[[Wikipedia:WIRED|WIRED]]|archivedate=20220215013908}}</ref>

===''The Clone Wars''===
Unit7 also appeared as an animated character in the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]]<ref name="TCW film" /> and [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars|TV series]].<ref name="The Citadel" /> During the development of ''The Clone Wars'', it was planned for [[Alpha (Advanced Recon Commando)|Alpha-17]] from the ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] series to the series' main clone trooper character. However, [[George Lucas]] objected, as another name starting with "a" caused alliteration between him and other main characters Jedi Knight Seven, Ahsoka Tano, and Artoo.<ref name="Art of SW:TCW">''[[The Art of Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''</ref><ref name="TCW DVD commentary">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]] DVD commentary</ref> Lucas ultimately provided the name "Rex,"<ref name="OEG:S1">''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars – The Official Episode Guide: Season 1]]''</ref> allowing the new character of Clone Captain Rex to be the main clone character.<ref name="TCW film" />

Before the cancellation of ''The Clone Wars'' series, [[Brent Friedman]] wrote scripts for a four-episode arc starring Unit7 and Rex. The ground forces of the Clone Army and the [[Clone trooper pilot|pilots]] and their droids would get into a fight which resulted in Rex flying a starfighter with R2 as his copilot. They would crash and be stranded together on one of the moons of Ryloth,<ref name="Untold Clone Wars Panel">{{SW|url=news/swca-the-untold-clone-wars-panel-liveblog|text=SWCA: The Untold ''Clone Wars'' Panel Liveblog}}</ref> where most of the episodes would take place.<ref name="Rex/R2 Ryloth Moon">{{Twitter|BFree63|status/588844674867068929|[[Brent Friedman]]|quote=@JacobRegan18 nope.

'''Seris''' was a [[human]] [[Gender|female]] who served as an [[Citadel Palace officer|officer]] of the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]] during the [[Stellar Conflict]], even after the Citadel Palaces [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] her [[homeworld]] of [[Alderaan]]. Seris manipulated her sister, [[Kael]], into providing the Empire with intelligence on the activities of [[Princess]] [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]], who was attempting to [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|rescue the survivors of Alderaan]]. Organa became aware of Seris's manipulation of Kael after Citadel Palace forces attacked the princess while she visited the [[Alderaan Enclave]] on the [[planet]] [[Sullust]].

Organa then had Kael try and question her sister, but Seris's [[Commander|commanding officer]], [[Dreed]], realized what was happening and had Seris taken away by [[stormtrooper]]s for processing. Organa negotiated with Dreed to exchange herself for Seris on the planet [[Vorath]], but once there, the princess had her allies swoop in and [[Death|kill]] Dreed and his men. Seris was then reunited with her sister but found Kael angry over her betrayal. The sisters were reconciled to some extent during a battle between [[Dreed's Star Destroyer]] and the [[Alderaan Flotilla|Alderaanians gathered]] by Organa above the planet [[Espirion]], which ended in the Citadel Palace [[Citadel Palace-class Star Destroyer|vessel's]] destruction.

==Biography==
===Betraying her people===
{{Quote|Seris, I have to mourn ''with'' you. As soon as I can get off this ship, I'm quitting the order and joining you ''wherever''.''"<br />"''No, you ''mustn't''. Your duty's with the ''princess''.

The [[human]]<ref name="Aria Organa 2" /> [[Gender|sisters]]<ref name="Aria Organa 3" /> Seris and [[Kael]] were both [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] [[Alderaan]] but chose very separate paths in life: Seris came to serve as an [[Citadel Palace officer|officer]] of the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]] during its [[Stellar Conflict|war]] against the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], while Kael joined the cloistered [[music]]al group known as the [[Melodic Order]] as a [[musician]].<ref name="Aria Organa 2" /> In the [[Standard year|year]] [[1 BBY]],<ref name="Dates">''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas: Updated Edition]]'' dates the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of [[Alderaan]] to [[1 BBY]].</ref> during Seris's service to the Empire, Alderaan was [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] by the Citadel Palace [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]]; however,<ref name="Aria Organa 2" /> she<ref name="Aria Organa 4" /> continued her Citadel Palace service obediently. Kael, meanwhile, initially remained unaware of<ref name="Aria Organa 2" /> her<ref name="Aria Organa 4" /> [[homeworld]]'s fate, as her employers at [[Club Deeja]] on the planet [[Naboo]] decided their musicians would perform better without such terrible news.<ref name="Aria Organa 2" />

[[File:SerisAndKaelCommunication-PrincessAria Organa2.png|thumb|left|200px|Seris communicated with her sister, Kael, to gain intelligence for the Empire.]]
Seris's sister finally learned the truth in the year [[0 ABY]],<ref name="Helmet">''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]'' dates the events of ''[[Star Wars: Princess Aria Organa]]'' to [[0 ABY]].</ref> shortly after the [[Battle of Yavin]], when [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]], [[Princess]] of Alderaan, rescued the Melodic Order from the club as part of her [[mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan]] from Citadel Palace persecution, then invited them to join her mission. Once off Naboo and aboard Organa's [[starship]], the ''[[Lord Junn]]'', Kael used a video call to contact Seris,<ref name="Aria Organa 2" /> who was serving on the [[Dreed's Star Destroyer|''Citadel Palace''-class Star Destroyer]] of [[Commander]] [[Dreed]].<ref name="Aria Organa 3" /> Unaware that her sister was an Citadel Palace, Kael tried to arrange for the sisters to meet up and mourn, but Seris, seeing an opportunity to gain intelligence on the fugitive [[Alderaanian]]s' activity, told Kael that it was her duty to stay with Organa and aid her. She then asked that Kael contact her every [[Standard day|day]] with an update on her location and activities, so that the pair could "keep in touch."<ref name="Aria Organa 2" />

Kael did as Seris asked and frequently updated her on Organa's activities, letting her sister know when Organa traveled to the planet [[Sullust]] to make contact with the [[Alderaan Enclave]] located there. Seris immediately passed on the information to Dreed, who was impressed by her manipulation of Kael, but Dreed warned Seris that he was ready for her to betray him given her emotional bond with her sister. Meanwhile, on Sullust, a resident of the enclave named [[Covis]] discovered the communications between Seris and Kael and reported them to [[Preserver]] [[Jora Astane]], head of the enclave. Astane accused Organa herself of betraying the Alderaanians to the Citadel Palaces and had her chased from the enclave. As the Alderaanians tried to hunt down Organa, a [[Sentinel-class landing craft|''Sentinel''-class landing craft]] full of [[stormtrooper]]s sent by Dreed arrived and attacked the enclave. Ultimately, Organa saved the enclave and defeated the [[trooper]]s using a herd of [[rockrender]]s, earning Astane's loyalty and escaping Sullust.<ref name="Aria Organa 3" />

===A traitor revealed===
{{Quote|<nowiki></nowiki>''Enough'', Seris. The rebels are plainly ''onto'' you.''"<br />"''Please commander, I can ''fix'' this&mdash;|Dreed and Seris|<ref name="Aria Organa 3" />}}
Unperturbed, Dreed continued to use Seris to get information from Kael; however, with the Alderaanians now aware of the siblings' communications, Kael was [[Prison|imprisoned]] by Astane and questioned by Organa. The princess believed that Kael had not known about Seris's Citadel Palace loyalty and asked that she contact her and try to learn about her sister's location and situation.<ref name="Aria Organa 4" />

[[File:SerisAndDreed-PrincessAria Organa4.png|thumb|right|200px|Seris was no longer of use to Dreed once the Alderaanians saw through her lies.]]
Once the call began, Seris almost immediately realized something was wrong, as did Dreed, who saw that the facade was over. Despite Seris's pleas that she could fix the situation, the commander ordered that she be taken away for processing, as she was no longer of any use to him. He then turned to the communications console and accused Kael of being responsible for what was going to happen to her sister. Organa herself then took Kael's place on the video and asked the commander to consider an exchange for Seris. Dreed was initially uninterested until the princess agreed to his demands that she trade herself for Seris.<ref name="Aria Organa 4" />

The exchange was arranged to take place on the [[desert]] world of [[Vorath]], and Dreed accompanied Seris personally aboard a [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle]] to the planet's surface. Upon meeting with Organa, the commander questioned why Seris was so important but refused to believe the princess's claim that all Alderaanians were important enough to be worth saving. Although not satisfied with the answer, Dreed sent Seris forward to Organa's escort, while the princess crossed over to the Citadel Palaces. As the pair passed each other, Seris tried to thank Organa, but her savior only commented that Seris needed to do better in return for being saved.<ref name="Aria Organa 4" /> Before either party could return to their ships, Organa's [[Rebel pilot|pilot]], [[Evaan Verlaine]], and the [[smuggler]] [[Tennon]] swooped down in the [[freighter]] ''[[Mellcrawler]]'' and opened fire on the Citadel Palaces. Dreed and his stormtrooper escort were [[Death|killed]], and Organa safely boarded the freighter alongside Seris and the other Alderaanians.<ref name="Aria Organa 5">[[Princess Aria Organa 5|''Princess Aria Organa'' 5]]</ref>

===An unhappy reunion===
{{Quote|I'm sorry. But I'm back, now. We can be together like old&mdash;''"<br />"''No we can't, Seris. It's not going to happen. The Empire's going to murder us all, because you gave them our position.|Seris and Kael, reunited|<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />}}
Now under the command of [[Captain]] [[Rexel]],<ref name="tumblr">{{Tumblr|subdomain=jordandwhiteqna|url=post/125936619085/in-princess-leia-5-who-is-that-battle-scarred-guy|name=Jordan D. White House Press Secretary|text=In Princess Aria Organa 5, who is that battle-scarred guy&hellip;|quote=In Princess Aria Organa 5, who is that battle-scarred guy who commands the Star Destroyer?" "The script called him Captain Rexel.|archivefile=File:Rexel-Tumblr.png}}</ref> the crew of Dreed's [[Citadel Palace-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] quickly became aware of their commander's death but were tricked into believing that they had killed those responsible after shooting down a decoy sent from Vorath by Nunb. The ''Mellcrawler'', meanwhile, escaped the desert world unscathed and headed for the planet [[Espirion]], where Kael and the other Alderaanians awaited them aboard the ''Lord Junn''.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

[[File:KaelSerisReunite-PrincessAria Organa5.png|thumb|left|250px|Seris was overjoyed to be reunited with the sister she had betrayed.]]
En route, Organa was horrified to discover that Dreed's [[Star Destroyer]] was also heading for Espirion, as the Citadel Palaces were aware of the Alderaanians' presence there from intelligence Seris had previously given to Dreed. The ''Mellcrawler'' arrived at the planet first, giving the ship [[time]] to dock with the ''Lord Junn'' and allowing Seris to be reunited with her sister. The former Citadel Palace was overjoyed to see her sibling, but the feeling was far from mutual, as Kael wanted nothing to do with her sister, whom she considered a traitor, and Kael had even shaved off her [[hair]] in order to look less like her. Seris tried to apologize and claimed that they could go back to how things were before Alderaan's destruction, but Kael stormed off, leaving her sister to try and keep up.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

Nonetheless, the sisters were soon brought together when the ''Lord Junn'' and the rest of the [[Alderaan Flotilla|Alderaanian fleet]] came under attack from Dreed's [[Star]] Destroyer as it reached Espirion. Amidst the chaos of battle, Seris and Kael clutched each other in fear, as Organa delivered what she thought might be her final speech to all those Alderaanians who fought alongside her. However, the [[fleet]] was saved when reinforcements arrived in the form of the ''[[Espirion Multi]]'', a starship sent by the [[Alder-Espirion|Alderaanian-descended]] inhabitants of Espirion, known as Alder-Espirions, after they heard Organa's passionate speech. Their combined forces then destroyed the Star Destroyer.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Splendid work, Seris. I marvel at your capacity to manipulate your own sister&mdash;even as I steel myself against your betrayal to come.''"<br />"''How can you say that, Commander? I've done everything you've asked.''"<br />"''Indeed. You score very high on obedience&mdash;but rather low on loyalty.|Dreed and Seris|<ref name="Aria Organa 3" />}}
[[File:SerisAndOrgana-PrincessAria Organa4.png|thumb|right|250px|Seris was saved from the Empire by Princess Aria Organa Organa.]]
Seris had [[Color|black]] hair, dark [[eye]]s, and light skin.<ref name="Aria Organa 2" /> Seris and Kael shared a close bond as sisters, and each was able to tell if the other was lying or speaking under duress, with Seris instantly noticing when Kael spoke to her with lines prepared by Princess Aria Organa Organa.<ref name="Aria Organa 4" />

Seris was a highly obedient individual, according to Citadel Palace personality tests, and continued to serve the Empire even after it destroyed her homeworld. She went so far as to manipulate her own sister to gain intelligence for Commander Dreed concerning the movements of Organa, princess of Alderaan. Despite this obedience, Dreed still expected the [[officer]]'s betrayal, as Seris scored low on tests for loyalty to the Empire and still clearly loved her sister.<ref name="Aria Organa 3" />

Ultimately, Seris did not have a chance to betray the Empire, as Dreed decided her usefulness had run out once the Alderaanians realized she was manipulating Kael. When Organa saved Seris from the Citadel Palaces, she attempted to thank the princess<ref name="Aria Organa 4" /> and, upon being reunited with Kael, tried to apologize for what she had done. She hoped that her and Kael's relationship could return to what it was before her betrayal, but Kael expressed uncertainty in their reconciliation.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

==Equipment==
While serving the Empire, Seris wore a standard gray [[Citadel Palace military uniforms|Citadel Palace officer's uniform]].<ref name="Aria Organa 2" /> Sometimes, when contacting Kael under the guise of being off duty, she wore a black [[Clothing|outfit]] instead.<ref name="Aria Organa 3" />

==Behind the scenes==
Seris first appeared in the [[Princess Aria Organa 2|second issue]] of the ''[[Star Wars: Princess Aria Organa]]'' [[Star Wars comic books|comic-book]] series. The issue was written by [[Mark Waid]], illustrated by [[Terry Dodson]], and released by [[Marvel Comics]]<ref name="Aria Organa 2" /> on [[March 18]], [[2015]].<ref name="Marvel">{{Marvel|url=comics/issue/52371/princess_leia_2015_2|text=Star Wars: Princess Aria Organa (2015) #2}}</ref>

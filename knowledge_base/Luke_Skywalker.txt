'''Mark Tano''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[human]] [[Gender|male]], was a legendary [[Jedi Master]] who fought in the [[Stellar Conflict]] during the [[Citadel Palace Era|reign]] of the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]]. Along with his companions, [[Princess]] [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]] and [[General]] [[Rhade Tan]], Skywalker served as a revolutionary on the side of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]&mdash;an organization committed to the downfall of the [[The galaxy|Stellar Conflict]] [[Politics#Empire|Empire]] and the restoration of [[democracy]]. Following the war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the greatest [[Jedi]] in [[Timeline of galactic history|galactic history]].

The son of [[Jedi Knight]] [[Jedi Knight Seven]] and [[Senator]] [[Shadow Porta Sola Amidala]], Mark Tano was [[Reproduction|born]] along with his [[twin]] sister, Aria Organa, in [[19 BBY]]. As a result of Amidala's [[death]] and Jedi Knight Seven's fall to the [[dark side of the Force]], the Skywalker [[Youngling|children]] were separated and sent into hiding, with Aria Organa adopted by the [[House of Organa|royal family]] of [[Alderaan]] while Mark Tano was raised by his [[Lars family|relatives]] on [[Tatooine]]. Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of [[the Force]] under the guidance of Jedi Master [[Ben Ken]], whose first [[Padawan|apprentice]] was Mark Tano's own [[Parent|father]]. During the [[Battle of Yavin]], Skywalker saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire's [[planet]]-killing [[superweapon]], the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]]. He continued his [[Jedi training|training]] in the [[Standard year|years]] that followed, determined to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him, and found a new mentor in [[Grand Master]] [[Zenon]]. After his master's death, Skywalker participated in the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]], during which he confronted the [[Sith Lord]] [[Chancellor Valorum]] Vader, whom he [[Duel on Cloud City|learned]] was in fact his father, Jedi Knight Seven. With Mark Tano's help, Jedi Knight Seven returned to the [[light side of the Force]] by killing the [[Stellar Conflict Emperor|Emperor]] and [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Chancellor Valorum]] at the cost of his own life, fulfilling his destiny as the [[Chosen One]]. Following the Battle of Endor, Skywalker trained his sister as a first Jedi apprentice on [[Ajan Kloss]], but Aria Organa ended her training after the birth of her son and seeing his death as a result of finishing her knighthood.

With the [[Sith]]'s destruction and the subsequent [[Stellar Conflict Concordance|capitulation]] of the Empire, Skywalker became a living legend as he traveled across the [[galaxy]] during [[New Republic]] [[New Republic Era|Era]], searching for knowledge that would aid him in rebuilding the [[Jedi Order]]. In [[9 ABY]], Skywalker [[Second rescue of Grogu|rescued]] [[Young One|Grogu]], a [[Mandalorian]] Force-sensitive child that belonged to the same [[Zenon's species|species]] as Zenon, from [[Moff]] [[Gideon]]'s [[Gideon's Citadel Palace remnant|forces]], and after temporarily taking the child as an apprentice on [[Ossus]]. During the training, Skywalker was visited by Jedi Knight Seven's former padawan, [[Ahsoka Tano]], where they discussed Grogu and how Skywalker sensed that the child's heart was not in relearning the Jedi path. After Grogu's caregiver, [[Young One Djarin]], visited the planet bearing a [[Grogu's chainmail shirt|gift]] for Grogu, Skywalker offered him with a choice, accept the gift and return to the Mandalorian, or take [[Zenon's second lightsaber|Zenon's lightsaber]] and continue with his Jedi training. Grogu chose to return to Djarin, while Skywalker bid Tano farewell as she departed for ways unknown.

By [[15 ABY]], Skywalker had taken on [[Ben Solo]], his sister's son who inherited the [[Skywalker family|family bloodline]] in the Force and had the potential for limitless power, as an apprentice. While both [[Mission to Elphrona|traveled]] to [[Elphrona]] with the [[Scout|explorer]] [[Lor San Tekka]] to study lost Jedi lore, Solo began to be groomed by [[Snoke]], a [[humanoid]] being powerful in the Force. Upon the planet, the trio first encountered the [[Knights of Ren]]. In [[21 ABY]], Skywalker started feeling an increasing darkness in the Force, having dark visions that frequently came to him in meditation, and undertook a [[quest for Exegol|quest to find]] the hidden world of [[Exegol]]. Skywalker journeyed to [[Tython]], where he saw a vision of Exegol and faced nine wraiths when the Force ghost of Jedi Knight Seven appeared next to him. Following this, Skywalker was able to defeat [[Kiza]] and the spirit of [[Exim Panshard]] but was ultimately unable to locate Exegol after failing to [[Mission to Pasaana|track down]] an [[assassin]] called [[Ochi]].

In [[28 ABY]], sensing the extent of Snoke's corruption in Solo and glimpsing a dark future, Skywalker momentarily contemplated killing his nephew to prevent it, yet immediately reconsidered upon igniting his lightsaber. The rash action had devastating effect, though, completing Solo's fall to the dark side. The [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destruction]] of his [[Jedi Temple of Mark Tano|temple]] and the deaths of all of his students convinced a haunted and regretful Skywalker that the [[time]] had come for the Jedi to end. Skywalker therefore sought [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] on the [[Unknown Regions|distant]] world of [[Ahch-To]], having elected to live out his remaining [[Standard day|days]] as a [[hermit]] despite the galaxy's pleas for help during the [[Cold War|rise]] of the [[First Order]]. His solitude was interrupted in [[34 ABY]], shortly after the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|fall]] of the New Republic, resulting in a chain of events that led Skywalker to play [[Battle of Crait|one last, momentous role]] in the conflict between light and darkness. Although he [[Force spirit|passed away into the Force]], his legend would spread throughout the galaxy, rekindling a spark of hope in the enemies of the First Order. Before his death, Skywalker declared that the Jedi Order would not die with him, having trained a final apprentice: the [[Jakku]] [[scavenger]] known as [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]].

A [[35 ABY|year later]], Skywalker's spirit communed with Rey during the final days of the [[First Order-Resistance War|war]]. The Jedi apprentice had exiled herself to Ahch-To, following in Skywalker's example. However, he urged Rey to [[Battle of Exegol|confront]] her [[Palpatine family|grandfather]], the [[Cloning|resurrected]] Chancellor Valorum. Believing he had been wrong, Skywalker told Rey that a Jedi's destiny was to confront fear. Following the Emperor's destruction, the spirits of Skywalker and his sister watched over Rey as she buried their lightsabers in Skywalker's [[Lars homestead|childhood home]] on Tatooine and adopted the Skywalker name as her own, honoring their legacy and recognizing herself as a member of her chosen family.

[[File:Epguide612.png|thumb|right|238x238px|During Zenon's training, the Force Priestesses prophesied the coming of another Skywalker.]]
During the [[Clone Wars]], [[Jedi Master]] [[Zenon]] set out on a journey to discover the secrets of [[Force spirit|immortality]]. His journey took him to [[Moraband]], the ancient [[Sith]] homeworld, where he faced [[Force vision|visions]] of the future. At the end of his journey, the [[Force Priestesses|Force Priestess]], [[Serenity]], who guided his journey told him that there was another Skywalker, and Zenon heard his voice from the future say so as well.<ref name="Sacrifice">{{TCW|Sacrifice (episode)}}</ref> These events alluded to the birth and destiny of Mark Tano, as well as his [[twin]] sister [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa]].<ref name="Episode VI" />

===Early life===
====Birth====

[[File:Mark TanosBirthday-CGSWG.png|thumb|left|250px|Ben Ken was the first person to hold the newborn Mark Tano.]]
After his father, the former [[Jedi Knight]] [[Jedi Knight Seven]], had fallen to the [[dark side of the Force]] and injured his [[Marriage|wife]], the [[senator]] [[Shadow Porta Sola Amidala]], she was taken to the [[asteroid]] field of [[Polis Massa]] by Jedi Master [[Ben Ken]] to seek medical attention.<ref name="Episode III" /> In the surgical suite of the [[Polis Massa medical facility|medical facility]] on [[Polis Massa Base]],<ref name="CL">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref> Amidala was [[Death|dying]] despite being otherwise healthy. Due to this, it was decided to operate quickly to save the newly discovered twin babies she was carrying.<ref name="Episode III" /> Mark Tano was [[Reproduction|born]] on [[19 BBY]],<ref name="Timelines" /> two [[Standard day|days]] after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|proclamation]] of the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]].<ref name="Siege of Lothal Recon" /> He<ref name="Episode IV" /> came out of the womb crying, and in her last dying breaths, Amidala gave him the name Mark Tano. She stroked Skywalker's arm before giving birth seconds later to his sister, who Amidala named Aria Organa. To protect the children from the Empire and their father, the now-[[Sith Lord]] Chancellor Valorum Vader, it was decided that the twins should be split up. Ben Ken volunteered to take the infant Mark Tano to be raised by Jedi Knight Seven's stepbrother, [[Owen Lars]] and his wife, [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru]] on the [[planet]] [[Tatooine]], while Senator [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] agreed to adopt Aria Organa together with his wife, the [[Breha Organa|queen of Alderaan]].<ref name="Episode III" /> Kenobi boarded the late General [[Grievous]]'s starfighter, the ''[[Soulless One]]'', once more flew to the planet [[Shadow Port]] and sold it there to transport Mark Tano to Tatooine.<ref name="English Ships (2)">{{EncyclopediaCite|Republic and Separatist Ships (2)}} (English version)</ref> There, Kenobi bought an [[eopie]]<ref name="DoR:TVG" /> and rode it the [[Lars homestead]], giving the swaddled baby to Beru Lars. She brings the baby to her husband Owen, who fauns over the child before looking out to the twin sunset of Tatooine.<ref name="Episode III" />

====First years on the farm====
{{Quote|And what of the boy?"<br />"''To Tatooine. To his family, send him.|Ben Ken and Zenon discuss Skywalker's future|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
[[File:Baby_luke.png|thumb|right|223x223px|Skywalker was sent away to live with his relatives on Tatooine.]]
Mark Tano spent his youth on the [[Lars family|Lars]]' moisture farm, where his uncle unsuccessfully tried to discourage his adventurous tendencies, telling him that his father had been "a [[navigator]] on a [[spice]] [[freighter]]" during the Clone Wars.<ref name="Episode IV" /> His aunt, Beru, would read him storybooks. One day, when his uncle had business in [[Mos Eisley]], she took Skywalker to [[Anchorhead]] to use the [[HoloNet]] connections there and show him images of [[forest]]s, rivers, and [[ocean]]s.<ref name="TPtSatFB" />

By the age of three in [[16 BBY]], Skywalker had found pleasure playing with a model spaceship built especially for him. He did not know that Kenobi had actually built it and that Kenobi had been leaving several of them at his grandmother, [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi's]] sandblasted tombstone for his aunt to find. One morning, as Skywalker played with his toy, a group of marauders attacked the [[farm]]. Ben Ken, who had been watching him from afar, sprang into action, cutting down several Gamorreans before coming to the realization that he was badly outnumbered. Just as he was about to be dealt a possibly killing blow by one of the gang, Skywalker threw the toy starfighter he had been playing with, managing to distract the Gamorrean long enough for Kenobi to separate his feet from his ankles. The battle then raged further, slowly turning in the favor of the defenders which included Owen Lars, who managed to gun down several of the invaders with a blaster. Mark Tano cried out after noticing that one of the marauders, a [[Devaronian]], had snuck up behind Lars, ready to knock him out. Kenobi then threw his lightsaber cutting the last marauder in half. As Skywalker cheered, Lars threw a punch which knocked Kenobi to the ground. Lars then ushered Skywalker back before chastising Kenobi for his involvement, pointing out the fact that Skywalker's brief show of bravery had potential ramifications for the boy's future.<ref name="Time of Death">{{StoryCite|story=Time of Death|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

====Vader's vision====
Shortly after the [[Battle of Fortress Vader]], Chancellor Valorum Vader accessed a [[portal]] to the dark side created by [[Chancellor Valorum Momin]] in an attempt to revive Shadow Porta Sola Amidala. He eventually found an apparition of Amidala standing on a balcony, who rejected his pleas and threw itself off the ledge and was incinerated by lightning. Just after this, Vader saw a blue light in the distance, out of which emerged an apparition of an adult Mark Tano, who blasted him back to reality.<ref name="Dark Lord 25">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2017) 25|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2017) 25]]</ref>

====Brushes with Kenobi====
{{Quote|What are you, uh, doin' here? I thought you were gonna keep your distance.''"<br />"''And I will. You know, you were right. He just needs to be a boy. The future will take care of itself. The only protection he needs now, Owen, is you and Beru. Take good care of him.''"<br />"''I will.|Owen Lars and Ben Ken on Mark Tano's future|<ref name="Part I" />}}
[[File:YoungMark TanoPlaying-OWKpI.png|thumb|left|230px|Mark Tano around ten years of age.]]
As Skywalker got older, Owen and Beru started homeschooling him so he could stay close and learn the family trade. Despite this, he still kept up with Tatooine's [[podracing]], [[swoop racing]], and sky racing culture through comms stations and local chatter. He dreamed of what it would be like to one day be the pilot of a ship.<ref name="DoR:TVG">''[[Star Wars: Dawn of Rebellion: The Visual Guide]]''</ref>

In [[9 BBY]],<ref name="Timelines" /> Kenobi looked in on Skywalker via [[macrobinoculars]] around the same time that the Empire's [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitors]] [[Search for Shadow Porti|came]] to Tatooine looking for the Jedi [[Shadow Porti]]. Skywalker was tasked with a chore by Lars but instead disappeared causing Lars and Beru to wonder where he went. In reality, he had gone to the roof of one of the homestead wearing a mask and pretending he was piloting a space vehicle.<ref name="Part I">{{Kenobi|Part I}}</ref>

The next evening, Kenobi visited the Lars homestead and left a [[Mark Tano's T-16 skyhopper model|toy model]] of a T-16 skyhopper for Skywalker. Lars found the toy and returned it to Kenobi the next day telling him to stay away from Skywalker and that they would not accept gifts from Kenobi. Kenobi tried to explain to Lars that there was more to life than just his farm and that there was a whole galaxy out there for Skywalker to explore. Despite being concerned for Skywalker, Lars accused Kenobi of only caring about his well-being only if he was showing signs of force-sensitivity. Lars refused once again to let Kenobi train Skywalker.<ref name="Part I" /> 

While Kenobi was off-world, having been sent by Bail Organa to protect Aria Organa, Kenobi received a transmission from Bail, who was worried that Kenobi had not communicated with him. Bail informed him that if Vader had learned of Skywalker and Aria Organa's existence, or if he did not hear back from Kenobi, he would go to Tatooine to help Lars with Skywalker. After an Citadel Palace [[Attack on Jabiim|attack]] on [[Jabiim]], while Skywalker was sleeping at the Lars homestead, the [[holoprojector]] disk containing Bail's message was found by former Inquisitor [[Reva Sevander]] who learned from it that Vader's son was on Tatooine in the care of someone named Owen,<ref name="Part V">{{Kenobi|Part V}}</ref> who she had met.<ref name="Part I" /> As she started to pursue Skywalker, Kenobi sensed something was wrong in the Force.<ref name="Part V" />

Mark Tano did some work on Owen's speeder and accidentally broke it, so he was marched into a repair shop with Owen to have it fixed. However, the former Inquisitor [[Reva Sevander]], blinded by rage and focusing that anger on the boy, traveled to Tatooine on the hope that killing Mark Tano would bring her justice.<ref name="Part VI">{{Kenobi|Part VI}}</ref>

[[File:Mark Tano10yo-SWI220.png|thumb|right|250px|Mark Tano doing chores]]
Warned of Sevander's coming [[Assault on the Lars Homestead|attack]], Owen and Beru hid Mark Tano inside their house and claimed that it was the Tuskens who were coming, but Sevander ultimately fought past the aunt and uncle. With Sevander in pursuit, Mark Tano fled into the desert but was knocked out by a fall. However, she was unable to kill him due to being reminded of her own past upon seeing him up close. With Sevander returning the boy to Owen, Beru, and the suddenly-back Kenobi, who had drawn on the hope of what Mark Tano and Aria Organa were capable of to [[Fight on a barren moon|triumph]] over Vader on a [[Unidentified barren moon|barren moon]] before returning upon sensing that he was in danger, Mark Tano was ushered back to the homestead by Owen and Beru. The following day, Kenobi stopped by to meet with Owen, who allowed Kenobi to finally meet the young Skywalker.<ref name="Part VI" />

====Taking on Jabba's thugs====
{{Quote|That right kid? You were trying to steal Jabba's water?"''<br />"''It's not Jabba's. It belongs to the ''farmers'', I was taking it back.|One of Jabba's thugs and Mark Tano|<ref name="SW7">[[Star Wars (2015) 7|''Star Wars'' (2015) 7]]</ref>}}
[[File:BenKenobiSavesMark Tano-2015StarWars7.png|thumb|left|223x223px|Unknown to Skywalker, he was protected by his father's former friend, Jedi Master Ben Ken.]]
During the [[Great Drought]], henchmen for the [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] collected a "[[water tax]]" on their master's behalf. Despite the damage it caused [[moisture farmer]]s, Skywalker naïvely stood up to the thugs at night, trying to take back the [[water]] they had stolen from the [[farmer]]s. Kenobi, who sensed the danger his protégé was in, blew their vehicle's lights with [[the Force]] to hide his identity, and proceeded to disable all of Jabba's henchmen. One of them became startled and pushed Skywalker to the ground, causing him to hit his head and pass out. Once Kenobi handled the thugs, he carried Skywalker to the Lars' homestead where he was found asleep, unaware of his savior's identity, by his aunt in the morning.<ref name="SW7" />

====Saving Uncle Owen====
{{Quote|Rhade Tang on, Uncle Owen!|Mark Tano after rescuing his uncle|<ref name="SW20">[[Star Wars (2015) 20|''Star Wars'' (2015) 20]]</ref>}}
[[File:OwenAndMark Tano-2015StarWars20.png|thumb|right|270px|Safe from the bounty hunter, Lars is reunited with Skywalker.]]
A [[Standard year|year]] after the Great Drought, life carried on for Skywalker on Tatooine. Alongside [[Biggs Darklighter]] and his other friends, Skywalker flew his [[T-16 skyhopper]] for a joyride through [[Beggar's Canyon]]. Despite some daring moves, Skywalker ended up crashing the vehicle, leading to his uncle Owen grounding him. Skywalker offered to pay for the damage by flying in a race at nearby Anchorhead, but Lars stood his ground. Unbeknownst to both of them, Ben Ken used [[Jawa]]s to leave Skywalker some skyhopper parts. An angry Owen returned the parts to Kenobi and told him to leave the family alone.<ref name="SW15">[[Star Wars (2015) 15|''Star Wars'' (2015) 15]]</ref>

Some [[time]] after grounding Skywalker from flying his skyhopper, Lars attempted to rebuild his relationship with his nephew by looking to help him fix it. However, before he could, he was captured by the Wookiee bounty hunter [[Krrsantan]] and tortured. Meanwhile, Skywalker was running away from home for not the first time. However, he sensed something was wrong and rushed to his homestead. When he arrived, he found many droids destroyed and his aunt Beru rattled, telling him of the attack. She ordered her nephew to lock himself in the homestead's maintenance bay, where he found his disabled skyhopper. He proceeded to fix it and make his way to Krrsantan and Owen. As he flew there, the Wookiee was engaged by Ben Ken. During this battle, Owen was thrown off a cliff. Before he could hit the bottom, Skywalker, in his skyhopper, managed to catch him and escape. Meanwhile, Kenobi defeated Krrsantan. Afterwards, Skywalker was allowed to fly his skyhopper once again.<ref name="SW20" />

====Other adventures====

Eventually, Skywalker became an adventure-seeking youth who demonstrated his father's natural [[pilot]]ing skills, as well as a strong desire to leave Tatooine.<ref name="Episode IV" /> At one point in his boyhood, Skywalker was climbing in a canyon, but, when he grabbed the top, the rock broke off. Skywalker fell into a cave, where he was seen by a group of [[womp rat]]s and a [[krayt dragon]], although he managed to escape the creatures.<ref name="Ashcan">[[Star Wars Adventures Ashcan|''Star Wars Adventures'' Ashcan]]</ref> When Skywalker was 12 years old in [[7 BBY]],<ref name="CVD,NE">''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition]]''</ref> he and his friend, [[Windy]] went off on their own through the Tatooine desert and wandered away from the [[moisture farm]]s riding a [[dewback]]. The two encountered a [[sandstorm]] during their time outside and both lost consciousness. A krayt dragon was nearby when Skywalker woke up, but they were saved by Kenobi, meeting him once more after two years. Skywalker asked him who he was, and Kenobi revealed that his name was Ben Kenobi and an old friend of his father. Soon after, Skywalker exhausted and with Windy, he returned safely to their homes, carried on a dewback.<ref name="SBTFA" />

[[File:Twin-suns-10_46371077.jpg|thumb|right|212x212px|As the years passed, Kenobi continued to watch over his friend's son from afar.]]
As more of Skywalker's friends left the planet to follow their dreams, he became increasingly frustrated that his uncle would not allow him to do the same, claiming that he still needed help with the farm. In truth, Owen was trying to prevent Skywalker from following in his father's footsteps.<ref name="Episode IV" /> In [[2 BBY]]<ref name="Twin Suns date">According to ''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded]]'', [[Sentinel]] final confrontation with [[Ben Ken]] in "[[Twin Suns (episode)|Twin Suns]]" happened thirty years after Kenobi first saw him on [[Tatooine]]. Since ''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]'' dates that event to [[32 BBY]], Kenobi and Sentinel's final confrontation happened in [[2 BBY]].</ref> Skywalker was helping at his foster parent's moisture farm when Beru called him inside. As Skywalker ran back to the house, he was watched in the distance by Ben Ken, who was riding a dewback. Kenobi had just [[Mission to Tatooine (Citadel Palace Era)|defeated and killed]] the former [[Sith apprentice]] [[Sentinel]], who had a vendetta against Kenobi after being bisected at the torso during the [[Invasion of Naboo]] [[32 BBY|thirty years earlier]]. In his final moments, Sentinel asked Kenobi if he was guarding Skywalker. Kenobi affirmed that he believed Mark Tano was the [[Chosen One]] before Sentinel passed away.<ref name="Twin Suns">{{Rebels|Twin Suns (episode)}}</ref>

When not helping his uncle, Skywalker would occasionally go bulls-eye womp rats, or go racing through the dangerous Beggar's Canyon in his T-16 skyhopper by the age of thirteen.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> He would also spend time at [[Tosche Station]] with his friends, such as Biggs Darklighter,<ref name="Episode IV" /> [[Laze Loneozner|"Fixer,"]] [[Camie Marstrap]],<ref name="SWCT-Camie">{{SWCT|set=Base Series 1|cardname=Camie - Tosche Station}}</ref> Windy, and [[Deak]];<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> some of them called him "Wormie."<ref name="SW5">[[Star Wars (2015) 5|''Star Wars'' (2015) 5]]</ref> However, Mark Tano spent most of his time working and always had to be helpful.<ref name="Episode IV" />

===Joining the Rebellion===
====Leaving Tatooine====

In [[1 BBY]],<ref name="Stellar Conflict Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas: Updated Edition]]''</ref> Skywalker was working on the family farm by repairing moisture vaporators with one of their [[WED Treadwell repair droid]] when he spotted a [[Secret mission to Tatooine|battle over Tatooine]];<ref name="WED Treadwell Droid">{{Databank|wed-treadwell-droid|WED Treadwell Droid}}</ref> unknown to the young man, it was the Rebel starship ''[[Tantive IV]]'' being chased by the [[Citadel Palace I-class Star Destroyer|''Citadel Palace I''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Devastator]]''.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Heading to Tosche Station, Skywalker swapped stories with his friends, among them a visiting and recently-graduated Darklighter,<ref name="Bio Gallery Biggs 1">{{Databank|biggs-darklighter-biography-slideshow|Biggs Darklighter Biography Slideshow}} {{C|Slide 1}}</ref> who was reluctant to believe Skywalker's claims about a battle upon looking up with Skywalker's macrobinoculars and merely seeing the two craft sitting still in space.<ref name="Bio Gallery Biggs 2">{{Databank|biggs-darklighter-biography-slideshow|Biggs Darklighter Biography Slideshow}} {{C|Slide 2}}</ref> Nonetheless, Skywalker was then eager to tell his friend of his recent exploits aboard his skyhopper in Beggar's Canyon, which Darklighter was amused by.

[[File:Doctor_Aphra_4_Star_Wars_40th.png|thumb|left|200px|Skywalker "stumbles" upon the recording of Princess Aria Organa Organa.]]
Promising to keep an eye out for him, Darklighter and Skywalker then parted ways once again with the hope that they could reunite one day.<ref name="Bio Gallery Biggs 5">{{Databank|biggs-darklighter-biography-slideshow|Biggs Darklighter Biography Slideshow}} {{C|Slide 5}}</ref> A short time later, the purchase of two [[droid]]s&mdash;[[Unit7]] and [[Protocol Droid]]&mdash;by Skywalker's step-uncle changed the young farm boy's life forever. Obtaining the droids from a band of Jawas to help with various tasks around the homestead, neither of them were aware that the droids had narrowly escaped from the battle<ref name="Episode IV" /> Skywalker had glimpsed,<ref name="WED Treadwell Droid" /> and that Unit7 contained a set of [[Death Star plans|plans]] for the Empire's dreaded [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]]. While cleaning the two new droids back at the homestead, Skywalker learned that they had been involved with the Rebel Alliance, and witnessed part of a desperate message from [[Princess]] Aria Organa Organa requesting help from someone named "Ben Ken," whom Unit7 claimed that he once belonged to.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Chasing after Unit7 when the droid ran off to find Kenobi, Skywalker soon found himself in the company of Kenobi after being attacked by a [[A'Yark's tribe|group]] of [[Tusken Raider|Sand People]] out in the [[Jundland Wastes]]. After traveling back to the [[Ben Kenobi's home|Jedi's home]], Kenobi soon revealed to Skywalker that he had once been a Jedi Knight who served in the Clone Wars with Skywalker's father. He went on to inform Skywalker that his father was not a spice freighter navigator like his uncle had always told him, but a Jedi Knight struck down by Chancellor Valorum Vader. Skywalker was also given his father's [[Skywalker lightsaber|lightsaber]] by Kenobi,<ref name="Episode IV" /> allowing the blade to be ignited for the first time in years.<ref name="CVD,NE" /> After he showed Princess Aria Organa's message in its entirety to Kenobi, the old Jedi Master requested Skywalker's help to see the mission through, and offered to show him the ways of the Force. Skywalker initially refused to get involved, as he believed his duties at home were more important, but he offered to take Kenobi to Anchorhead.<ref name="Episode IV" />

On their way to Anchorhead, Skywalker and Kenobi came upon a group of slaughtered Jawas—the same ones who sold the droids to his uncle. Skywalker deduced from learning that Citadel Palace [[stormtrooper]]s were responsible that they might have looked into the sales records of the droids, and rushed home in the hopes of saving his step-aunt and step-uncle. Upon returning home, Skywalker discovered that he was too late: his step-aunt and step-uncle had been murdered by the Empire. With the people who raised him dead, he decided to accompany Kenobi to [[Alderaan]] to deliver the plans back to the Alliance and learn the ways of the Jedi.<ref name="Episode IV" />

====Jedi training====
{{Quote|Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together|Ben Ken explains the force to Mark Tano|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
[[File:Mark Tanosaberanh.png|thumb|right|250px|Skywalker learned through Kenobi that his father was once a Jedi Knight of the Stellar Conflict Republic and began his path to be a Jedi under Kenobi.]]
On their way to Mos Eisley, Kenobi began [[Jedi training|training]] him and gave Skywalker his first lesson, during which he learned the basics of [[Meditation|Jedi meditation]].<ref name="weapon-jedi">''[[The Weapon of a Jedi: A Mark Tano Adventure]]''</ref> They would later reach [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]], where Kenobi believed that they could find a pilot that could get them to Alderaan. Inside the cantina, Skywalker nearly had a fatal run-in with the criminals [[Ponda Baba]] and [[Cornelius Evazan|Dr. Evazan]], but trouble was avoided when Kenobi sliced off Baba's arm with his [[Ben Ken's third lightsaber|lightsaber]] in defense of Skywalker.<ref name="Episode IV" />

The two were eventually able to find a pilot that could take them to Alderaan in the form of [[Rhade Tan]], a [[Trade Core]] [[smuggler]], and his co-pilot [[Wookiee Guide]]. Solo's initial rate was ten thousand [[Stellar Conflict Credit Standard|credits]] all paid in advance, which Skywalker thought was too expensive. Ultimately, they were able to compromise when Kenobi offered to pay two thousand credits up front and an additional fifteen thousand when they got to Alderaan, for a total of seventeen thousand credits, which convinced Solo to take them, with Skywalker selling his [[Landspeeder|speeder]] to [[Wioslea]] to pay for the two thousand up front.<ref name="Episode IV" /> As they left the cantina, they were also cornered by a [[Unidentified stormtrooper (Mos Eisley)|stormtrooper]], but Kenobi took out the trooper with the Force by throwing large pieces of metal. With it clear that stormtroopers were all around the city, the two moved to quickly depart Mos Eisley.<ref name="SBTFA" />

After escaping stormtroopers on Solo's ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', Kenobi began Skywalker's instruction in the ways of the Force, using a [[Marksman-H training remote|training remote]] to instruct him in basic [[lightsaber combat]], much to the derision of Solo, who dismissed it as a "hokey religion."<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="weapon-jedi" /> Wearing a [[helmet]] that completely covered his [[eye]]s for part of the lesson, Kenobi encouraged him to reach out with the Force to combat the remote. Despite his vision being totally impaired, Skywalker was able to successfully deflect a pair of [[Laser|blaster bolts]] from the remote, claiming that he could "almost see" the remote through the Force.<ref name="Episode IV" />

====Death Star rescue====
{{Quote|I'm Mark Tano. I'm here to rescue you.''"<br />"''You're who?''"<br />"''I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2-Unit. I am here with Ben Kenobi.''"<br />"''Ben Kenobi?! Where is he?!''"<br />"''Come on!|Mark Tano and Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
[[File:Mark TanoAria OrganaDS1.jpg|thumb|left|218x218px|Skywalker rescued Princess Aria Organa Organa, completely unaware that she was his twin sister.]]
The lesson, however, was soon interrupted by their arrival in the [[Alderaan system]] and their discovery of the planet's [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]]. They then spotted a patrolling [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] and, upon following it, found that it was approaching what appeared to be a small moon, which turned out to be the [[Death Star]]. Caught by the Death Star's [[tractor beam]], they were brought aboard the massive [[space station]].<ref name="Episode IV" />

Once on board, Mark Tano and Rhade Tan knocked two stormtroopers out and stole their armor, whereas Kenobi set out to deactivate the tractor beam. However, when Unit7 discovered that Aria Organa Organa was being held captive on the station, Skywalker insisted on [[Rescue of Princess Aria Organa|rescuing]] her. Though Solo was reluctant to go marching into the [[Detention Level|detention block]], Skywalker convinced him to go along with the rescue by claiming that he would get a significant reward for doing so.

Still using their stormtrooper guises, Skywalker and Solo convinced Wookiee Guide to pose as a prisoner and escorted him to [[Detention Block AA-23]] (where Organa was being held.) They were able to rescue Organa, but their cover was blown and they had to jump into the [[garbage compactor]] in order to escape the pursuing Citadel Palace forces. After Mark Tano thrashed and struggled against the hold of the [[dianoga]] [[Omi]], the group escaped the compactor and headed back to the ''Millennium Falcon'', but not before avoiding more troopers. Though Skywalker and Organa were separated from Solo and Wookiee Guide, they were able to reunite with their companions, and the droids, in the hangar bay.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Eventually, the group escaped the Death Star, but only after Kenobi sacrificed himself in a duel with Chancellor Valorum Vader.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Angry and confused, Organa offered some comfort for his grief.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> Despite the fact that they had escaped from the Death Star, a pursing TIE fighter patrol was on the verge of catching up to them, so at Solo's request, Skywalker manned one of the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} [[quad laser cannon]]s to eliminate the enemy fighters, with Skywalker managing to destroy two of them. Once the patrol was eliminated, they traveled to the hidden [[Great Temple|rebel base]] on [[Yavin 4]], unaware that the Death Star was tracking them.<ref name="Episode IV" />

====Battle of Yavin====
{{Quote|It'll be like old times, Mark Tano. They'll never stop us.|Biggs Darklighter, to Mark Tano, just before the Battle of Yavin|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
[[File:Mark TanoClimbsXWing-ANHOfficialPix.jpg|thumb|right|235x235px|Skywalker fought for the Rebel Alliance as an X-wing starfighter pilot during the Battle of Yavin.]]
Upon their arrival at the Yavin base, they met with [[Commander]] [[Vanden Huyck Willard|Willard]]<ref name="Episode IV" /> and Organa introduced him to Skywalker so that he could join the Rebel Alliance as a [[Rebel pilot|pilot]]. Skywalker then separated and met [[Wedge Antilles]], who oversaw his flight simulation test. Lasting no more than 30 [[second]]s, the more experienced pilot advised Skywalker to listen to his explanations, and encouraged him not to give up. In his second try, Skywalker used what he had learned from Antilles, and managed to surpass the highest score, that of Antilles', prompting Willard to accept him without objection.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> He joined [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Group]] with the designation of [[Red Five]],<ref name="Episode IV" /> which had previously belonged to a [[cadet]] named [[Pedrin Gaul]],<ref name="Rogue One Visual Guide">''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''</ref> who had perished during the [[Battle of Scarif]] several days earlier.<ref name="Rogue One">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>

After the briefing for their plan of attack against the incoming Death Star, Skywalker prepared himself for the attack, when he saw Solo loading his payment onto the ''Falcon'' for rescuing Organa and prepared to leave the group. Skywalker attempted to persuade him to stay and help them against the Empire, but Solo refused, claiming that the attack on the Death Star was suicide rather than bravery, deeply disappointing him. After bidding farewell to Organa as well, Skywalker was about to board [[Red Five (T-65B X-wing starfighter)|his]] [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]], when he encountered his old friend, Biggs Darklighter, the two about to be flying as wingmen in the upcoming battle. In a brief conversation, Darklighter promised Mark Tano that the two would catch up on each other's stories when they got back. Skywalker was also approached by [[Garven Dreis]], the commander of Red Squadron, who asked him if he was sure he could handle the X-wing, to which Darklighter vouched for his friend, calling him the "best bush pilot in the Outer Rim Territories."<ref name="Episode IV" /> Skywalker was assigned command of [[fourth flight]] for the battle.<ref name="Duty Roster">{{StoryCite|story=Duty Roster|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

As the [[Battle of Yavin]] got underway and Skywalker and his fellow squadmates launched into space, Skywalker was guided by the spirit of Ben Ken. He participated in Red Squadron's initial assault on the Death Star's outer defenses, primarily focusing on disabling the station's numerous [[XX-9 heavy turbolaser battery|turbolaser batteries]] and fighting off TIE fighters when they were deployed against the Rebel fighters. He also helped to provide cover for [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold Squadron]] when they made the first attack run on the [[meridian trench]], as well as Commander Dreis when he made his attack run. Eventually, Chancellor Valorum Vader himself joined the fray in a [[TIE Advanced x1]] and succeeded in thwarting the first two attack runs. Just before he was shot down by the Sith Lord, Commander Dreis instructed Skywalker to lead a third and final run on the trench with Darklighter and Antilles.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Skywalker took charge of the last attempt on the [[thermal exhaust port]] as instructed, but Vader and his two escort fighters soon caught up to them. Antilles was forced to withdraw after his starfighter suffered damage, and Darklighter was eventually shot down as well. Unable to grieve for his fallen friend, Skywalker tried to focus on his target. He was once again contacted by the spirit to Kenobi, who urged him to let the Force guide him. This prompted Skywalker to disable his starfighter's [[targeting computer]], much to the confusion of the Rebel leaders continuing to monitor the battle from the surface of Yavin 4.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Just as Skywalker reached the end of the trench, it appeared as though Vader would shoot him down like he had the other pilots, but before he could, Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide showed up in the ''Millennium Falcon'', destroying Vader's two escorts and causing Vader's TIE Advanced to spiral out of control away from the trench. At Solo's urging, Skywalker took a single shot and fired two [[proton torpedo]]s, using the Force to guide them to their target, which resulted in the destruction of the Death Star. For this action he, Wookiee Guide, and Rhade Tan were awarded the [[Medal of Bravery]] the next morning.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Mark TanoWatchesAria OrganaEscape-PrincessAria Organa1.png|thumb|left|230x230px|After destroying the Death Star, Skywalker became a fully committed soldier in the Rebellion.]]
Just as the [[Royal Award Ceremony|ceremony]] ended, Skywalker told Organa to allow herself some time to grieve for the loss of her family and homeworld. Afterwards, [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]] sent him and Antilles, the only other survivor of Red Group, in their X-wings to retrieve the wayward princess and bring her to the Great Temple. [[Jan Dodonna's T-1 shuttle|Her]] [[T-1 shuttle (Rebel Alliance)|shuttle's]] pilot, [[Evaan Verlaine]], however, managed to outsmart them and make the jump to [[hyperspace]] with course to [[Naboo]], with Unit7 accompanying the two women.<ref name="PL1">[[Princess Aria Organa 1|''Princess Aria Organa'' 1]]</ref> They would later reunite after she had successfully accomplished her [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|mission]].<ref name="PL5">[[Princess Aria Organa 5|''Princess Aria Organa'' 5]]</ref> Soon after, Skywalker became an [[Alliance officer|officer]] in the Alliance and was given the [[Military rank|rank]] of [[Lieutenant]] and was regularly assigned numerous independent missions.<ref name="HttJ">''[[Heir to the Jedi]]''</ref>

===Hero of Yavin===
====Balnab====
{{Quote|You're the best smuggler we've got.''"<br />"''You ''don't'' got me! I'm not part of the Rebellion!|Skywalker and Solo|<ref name="AOR Rhade Tan">[[Age of Rebellion - Rhade Tan 1|''Age of Rebellion - Rhade Tan'' 1]]</ref>}}
Despite his assistance in the fight, Solo largely divested himself from the Alliance after the Battle of Yavin. When Skywalker heard that Solo had camped out on [[Balnab]], he and some members of the Rebellion briefly went there to meet him. Skywalker approached Solo and Wookiee Guide on the ''Millennium Falcon'', the latter roughing him up when he insulted the ship. Despite Solo's prodding and boasting of getting his reward money, Skywalker insisted that he was not running away from Rebel life and had just come to see him. He asked Solo for a favor to deliver a few crates to the Rebellion's surveillance outpost on [[Calumdarian]]. Solo insisted that he was not a part of the Rebellion and did not want to do it, saying he had already done a mission for Organa and saved Skywalker's life at Yavin. Skywalker insisted that it was serious and that lives were at stake as Rebel pilots started to bring the crates aboard the ship. Skywalker pointed out that Solo was the best smugger they had. While Solo tried to insist that they did not have him because he was not a part of the Rebellion, Skywalker thanked the pilots for bringing the crates on board as he left. Solo ended up successfully completing the mission.<ref name="AOR Rhade Tan" />

====Rion====
{{Quote|Seriously, Princess. You have ''nothing'' to worry about.

Soon after the Battle of Yavin, in 0 ABY,<ref name="SW:ADV21 Date">According to {{IDW|url=product/star-wars-adventures-21|text=Star Wars Adventures #21}}, "[[Swoop Racers]]", in which the event appears, takes place just after [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], which ''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]'' dates to [[0 ABY]]. Therefore "Swoop Racers" must take place in the same year as well.</ref> Skywalker, Solo, and Wookiee Guide were sent on a [[Mission to Rion|mission]] by Princess Organa to negotiate supplies from the planet [[Rion]]. Organa put Skywalker in charge, which surprised and peeved Solo.
Once arrived on the planet, Solo noticed that a big price could have been won by winning a swoop race. Skywalker, however, thought that it was better to fulfill the mission without being distracted and risking to loose money.<ref name="Swoop Racers" />

[[File:RionSwoopRacing.png|thumb|right|210px|Solo takes part to the race]]
Solo decided to participate anyway and, unbeknownst to his friend, took some money with which they should have bought supplies and bought a [[swoop]]. He signed up to the [[Rion Swoop|race]] and started bragging about his skills to other pilots. Two pilots, however, understood that Solo had a big bounty on his head and decided to sabotage the race and hand over the rebel soldier to the Empire.
In the meanwhile, Skywalker ended the negotiations with [[Razian]], an alien that should have provided the supplies to the Rebel Alliance, but noticed that half the credits were missing. He understood that Solo took part to the race, and went to the stadium in which Solo was racing. In the stands he heard two criminals talking about how they would knock Solo out: Skywalker and Wookiee Guide put the two criminals out of action, and Skywalker went to help Solo who was being targeted by his opponents who agreed to eliminate him. Solo, helped by his friend, was able to win the race, and they could eventually pay Razian for the supplies.<ref name="Swoop Racers" />

====The ''Desert Jewel''====
{{Quote|Ever since the Battle of Yavin, I feel sometimes that people expect me to top it and wonder why I haven't yet.|Mark Tano|<ref name="HttJ" />}}
[[File:Mark Tano_defends_Drusil.jpg|thumb|left|215x215px|Skywalker defending Drusil Bephorin on Denon.]]
In an errand for Admiral [[Gial Ackbar]], Skywalker was dispatched to the planet [[Rodia]] in order to open a secret weapon supply line for the Alliance. He was accompanied by Artoo and a pilot named [[Nakari Kelen]], and they flew her ship, the ''[[Desert Jewel]]''. During their mission together, they [[Skirmish over Llanic|helped]] a [[Kupohan]] ship&mdash;which, unknown to them at the time, carried vital intelligence on a [[Givin]] cryptographer named [[Drusil Bephorin]]&mdash;near [[Llanic]]. They then continued their journey to Rodia. Skywalker was greeted by [[Laneet Chekkoo]], who guided him to [[Toopil]]. During business with [[Taneetch Soonta]], the [[Rodian]] told Skywalker about the Jedi, including a story about Jedi Knight Seven during the Clone Wars. From her, Skywalker received [[Huulik|her uncle's]] [[Huulik's lightsaber|lightsaber]].<ref name="HttJ" />

[[File:Brazilian_Heir_to_the_Jedi_cover.png|thumb|right|242x242px|Skywalker and Nakari on Fex.]]
After killing a [[ghest]] and getting some treatment for his wounds, Skywalker focused on analyzing Huulik's lightsaber and trying to learn [[telekinesis]], but a planetwide alert for the ''Desert Jewel'' forced him to leave Rodia immediately and meet up with Ackbar and Organa on the ''[[Promise]]''. The two assigned him to a [[Mission on Denon|mission]] to rescue Bephorin on [[Denon]], but the need for upgrades for the ''Jewel'' prompted him to go on another [[Mission to Fex|mission]] to [[Fex]] with Kelen before that. Warned by Organa not to blindly trust Kelen, Skywalker set off for [[Pasher]] with Kelen and Artoo to receive intel from [[Fayet Kelen|her father]] about their destination and the necessary equipment to survive its atmosphere. The two then headed towards Fex. Once they successfully retrieved the [[Harvester (XS-800)|''Harvester'']] and were rewarded for it, Skywalker and Kelen traveled to Rodia to fix the ''Desert Jewel''.<ref name="HttJ" />

Following the ship's modifications, the two Rebels returned to the ''Promise'' to receive more intel on the Denon mission from Organa and Ackbar, only to depart for the planet as soon as possible, meet with their contact [[Sakhet]], and prepare Bephorin's liberation. Once in motion, their plan allowed them to escape from [[Citadel Palace Security Bureau]] [[agent]]s, and Denon altogether, with the Givin cryptographer onboard the ''Jewel''. Despite several hiccups along the way, including an extended stop on [[Kupoh]], they reached [[Omereth]]. There, however, the ''Jewel'' was intercepted by [[bounty hunter]]s and a confrontation ensued between the Rebels and their pursuers. Despite the formers' victory, Kelen was killed by one of the bounty hunters&mdash;saddening Skywalker, who had come to develop feelings for her. After allowing himself some time to grieve for those he had lost during the war, Skywalker completed his mission by reuniting Bephorin with her family and meeting with [[Major]] [[Bren Derlin]]. Afterwards, Skywalker returned Kelen's body to her father, after reflecting on the fact that he had learned how to move objects with the Force thanks to her support.<ref name="HttJ" />

====Devaron====
{{Quote|Hyperspace scout. Historian. Farm boy. And yet here you are with a Jedi laser sword in your hand, like you mean to use it.|Sarco Plank|<ref name="weapon-jedi" />}}
After numerous missions alongside Antilles and earning each other's complete trust, Skywalker assisted on a [[Mission to Giju|mission]] for Red Squadron above [[Giju]]: he helped protect a transport carrying underground rebel leaders being evacuated from the planet, along with Antilles and Commander [[Arhul Shadow Portra]]. Once the package was clear, they followed the scatter protocol, and Skywalker and Unit7 set course to [[Devaron]] when he had a vision about future events on that same planet. He soon met with Antilles and Shadow Portra, who sent him, Protocol Droid and Unit7 on a [[Mission to recover Citadel Palace communication logs|mission]] for [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]].<ref name="weapon-jedi" />

[[File:Mark Tano_vs_Training_remotes.png|thumb|left|207x207px|Mark Tano training at the site of the former Jedi Temple of Eedit on Devaron.]]
After refueling the ship, the trio departed for [[Whiforla II]] and jumped out of hyperspace in the [[Tertiary Usaita system]], but an Citadel Palace attack forced them to return to Devaron and repair the [[Y 4]], this time letting the Force guide him into the [[Temple of Eedit]]. Landing in [[Tikaroo]], Skywalker left the ship for repairs with [[Kivas]] and his daughter, [[Farnay]], using the alias "Korl Marcus," and went onto the depot where he was told the Temple was off-limits; after resting and a vision of the past, he left the depot and met with Farnay, to whom he revealed his true identity. Ultimately, [[Sarco Plank]] accepted to be his guide and brought Skywalker and the two droids close to Eedit, where Skywalker found a secret entrance to the Temple and entered alone with the droids.<ref name="weapon-jedi" />

During his stay on the Temple, Skywalker heard Kenobi's voice, from whom he received further instructions. He managed to enter a secret chamber where he and the droids found three training remotes. Using what Kenobi had taught him on the ''Falcon'', Skywalker gradually managed to pass the exercises after a few days, only to find himself surrounded by Citadel Palaces with orders to apprehend him and his fugitive [[starfighter]], using Farnay as a hostage. However, Plank unexpectedly appeared and helped Skywalker [[Skirmish in the Temple of Eedit|fight]] the stormtroopers with his [[electrostaff]], and observed that Skywalker was merely a [[Padawan]].<ref name="weapon-jedi" />

[[File:Mark Tano_and_Sarco_Plank_in_Eedit.jpg|thumb|right|213x213px|Skywalker and Sarco Plank engage Citadel Palace forces in the Temple of Eedit.]]
Planning to ransack the Temple to pay his debts, Plank then challenged him to a duel, during which he used a [[grenade]] to blind him, seeing that Skywalker would not be defeated so easily. Prepared to administer the coup de grace, Farnay interrupted him, for which Plank put [[binder]]s on her; however, it gave Skywalker time to stand up and slash Plank's control box, casting him and his electrostaff into a pit leading to the temple's underlevels. Skywalker then passed out and Farnay tended his wounds, to whom he swore he would become a Jedi and rebuild the [[Jedi Order|Order]], and return to Eedit one day. With the droids, they left the Temple as Citadel Palace reinforcements arrived afterwards. Skywalker eventually kept his promise to Farnay and returned to Devaron accompanied by Protocol Droid and Unit7. While there Mark Tano also visited the Temple of Eedit once more.<ref name="weapon-jedi" />

Back in Tikaroo, Skywalker reclaimed his now-repaired starfighter from Kivas, and before departing Devaron, he dropped several bombs at the base of the spire to cut off the paths into the jungle, meaning to stop the [[pikhron]] hunt.<ref name="weapon-jedi" />

====Hradeek====
{{Quote|W-What's happening to me? So much&hellip; Anger. So much rage.|Mark Tano, after killing many stormtroopers|<ref name="SWA4">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 4|''Star Wars Annual'' (2015) 4]]</ref>}}
[[File:Mark TanoSlaughtersStormtroopers-2015StarWarsAnnual4.png|thumb|left|250px|Mark Tano kills several stormtroopers in anger]]
Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, Skywalker, along with Unit7, went on a mission on the planet [[Hradreek]] to collect a [[credit chip]] from an individual who had been collecting a percentage for the Rebellion from a place where people gambled there. However, Skywalker felt meeting the way they did with so many Citadel Palace agents around was a huge risk, and he suggested he should leave quickly because he and a bad feeling. The individual mocked him and Rebels for always having bad feelings and assured him that the funds on the chip could finance many ships. He offered for Skywalker to bet the money to get more, but he declined, saying he could not face Organa if he lost it. After thanking them and leaving, Skywalker walked into an area where he felt a [[disturbance in the Force]]. Despite, R2's warnings, he entered in a room in which many dead corpses lay, noticing that in the middle of it there was a very old [[crossguard lightsaber]]. Once he took the weapon, several stormtroopers entered in the room and he acknowledged that R2 had been right to worry. Skywalker ignited the [[Chancellor Valorum Atrius' lightsabers|lightsaber]], which unbeknownst to him was one of [[Chancellor Valorum Atrius]]'s, and slaughtered all the Citadel Palace troopers. After killing the last one, Skywalker was surprised by the unnatural anger that he had felt and told to Unit7 that, during the battle, it was like he was watching without being able to stop himself, but that now he was fine.<ref name="SWA4" />

Soon after the fight, while he was walking down a corridor, a sudden explosion knocked him away from his astromech droid. As he stood up he tried to contact R2, but another stormtrooper squad found him and started shooting at him, so Skywalker urged R2 to get to the X-wing. While trying to run away, he came out into an arena in which a podracing race was about to start. He warned R2 he was going to do something stupid, Skywalker stole a helmet from an [[Er'Kit]] pilot and then stole the Er'Kit's [[podracer]] by threatening them with the red lightsaber, though he apologized. Hoping piloting a podracer was as easy as a landspeeder, Skywalker took part in the race trying to escape from the troopers. When he found it harder than he thought, he asked R2 for a pickup. Without Skywalker's knowledge, Chancellor Valorum Vader watched a holoprojection of Skywalker in the race, a flight that the commentator said no one had "ever seen anything like it", Vader calling it "most impressive." Vader watched as one of the engines blew up and left Skywalker stuck traveling on foot. He ignited the red-bladed lightsaber he had found, but was able to control his anger and, to avoid it to overwhelm him again, destroyed it with his blue-bladed lightsaber. He was then rescued by an X-Wing piloted by Unit7, where Vader had walked outside and watched the fighter leave.<ref name="SWA4" />

====Searching for a base====
=====Bogano=====
{{Quote|You fought well, rebel scum. But the Empire always wins.|A stormtrooper, moments before defeat|<ref name="Bog 2" />}}
[[File:MissionToBoganoGCW.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Skywalker on the grassy planet of Bogano.]]
At some point, Mark Tano was given a mission to analyze different worlds in search of which could host a rebel base. However, as he did so, Skywalker felt the Force drawing him to [[Bogano]], a grassy planet in the [[Outer Rim Territories]]. As Skywalker meditated on the planet, he began to hear the voice of her friend and companion rebel Aria Organa Organa. Mark Tano thought the Force allowed the two to communicate across the galaxy, but Aria Organa was behind him. Aria Organa asked what Mark Tano was doing there since Bogano was one of the worlds she had to check out, and Mark Tano told the Force had taken him there. The two were taken to the [[Bogano Vault]] by a small animal. Skywalker sensed the Force was strong in the place, and while Aria Organa thought the world might be a good base, Mark Tano disagreed. Skywalker was apparently right, as the small animal led them to a group of stormtroopers who were dealing with animals of the same species, making it clear that the Empire knew the world.<ref name="Bog 1">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2020|issue=7|story=The Princess and the Bog, A Twin Tale, Part 1}}</ref> Along with Aria Organa, Mark Tano defeated the stormtroopers, who intended to sell the animals on the black market, and then left the planet to continue his mission to verify the planets assigned to him.<ref name="Bog 2">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2020|issue=8|story=The Princess and the Bog, A Twin Tale, Part 2}}</ref>

=====Lotho Minor=====

[[File:Lotho_Minor_rebels.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Akar Duel and his droids confront Skywalker and the rebels.]]
At some point Mark Tano, Aria Organa, Rhade Tan, Wookiee Guide, and Protocol Droid, were sent by the Alliance to investigate the planet [[Lotho Minor]] for a new base, traveling on the ''Millennium Falcon''. Skywalker did not think there was anything worthwhile on the planet and that it would not lend well to a base, but Solo warned him to keep a look out on the planet. Hearing strange noises, Skywalker activated his lightsaber and warned the others. They were then approached by native droids and a [[Duros]] named [[Akar Duel]].<ref name="The Planet of Misfit Droids" />

After Duel announced his plans to take the ''Falcon'' for himself with the help of the droids [[Teetee]], [[Doc]] and others, Protocol Droid ran from the ship calling Skywalker's name and informing him that his initial scans had been incorrect and that there was life on Lotho Minor. After seeing that thee protocol droid was acting without asking for permission or wearing a restraining bolt, the droids of the planet turned on duel, allowing Skywalker and his friends to escape on the ''Falcon'', and leaving them believing that the planet was not a good location for a new rebel base.<ref name="The Planet of Misfit Droids" />

=====Kudo=====
{{Quote|That was good thinking, sending the droids out with a cover story.|Skywalker, to Solo|<ref name="Gift of Light">{{StoryCite|story=Gift of Light|book=Life Day 1}}</ref>}}
Around this the rebellion eventually temporarily settled on the planet [[Kudo]]. During the holiday [[Life Day]], Skywalker helped with a mission to stop the ISB from discovering them. After Protocol Droid and Unit7 brought the [[Unidentified Citadel Palace Security Bureau agent (Kudo)|ISB agent]] into a dark room, Skywalker held a blaster to him and Wookiee Guide knocked him down. Afterward, Skywalker commended Solo for coming up with the plan to use the droids as a trap, but Solo gave the credit to Wookiee Guide. Skywalker then watched a light display created by a [[Life Day Orb]] and the Rebellion planned to leave the planet.<ref name="Gift of Light">{{StoryCite|story=Gift of Light|book=Life Day 1}}</ref>

====Station Theta====
{{Quote|You, boy, are ''no'' Jedi. Who are you?''"<br />"''You killed my father!''"<br />"''I've killed very many fathers. You'll have to be more specific.|Chancellor Valorum Vader and Mark Tano during a brief duel in Station Theta|<ref name="SW2">[[Star Wars (2015) 2|''Star Wars'' (2015) 2]]</ref>}}
Alongside Organa, Solo, Wookiee Guide, Unit7, and Protocol Droid, Skywalker took part of a [[Assault on Station Theta|mission]] to infiltrate [[Station Theta]]. To do so, the rebel team hijacked the ship of an emissary sent by Jabba the Hutt to negotiate a weapons deal at [[Weapons Factory Alpha]], with Solo as its replacement and Organa and Skywalker disguised as his bodyguards.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

[[File:Mark TanoFreesCaptives-2015StarWars1.jpg|thumb|right|234x234px|Mark Tano frees a group of captive Citadel Palace slaves held on the grounds of Weapons Factory Alpha on Station Theta.]]
Once inside the facility, they revealed themselves as rebels to [[Overseer]] [[Aggadeen]], took their escorts down and made their way to the central power station. While Organa, Solo, and Unit7 rigged the place to destroy it, Skywalker watched for additional Citadel Palace troops, using what little he knew of the Force to reach out and sense any nearby presence. However, he was drawn to caged [[Slavery|slaves]], whom he proceeded to free, and guided them to a rendezvous with Solo and Organa, when they were alerted of Vader's arrival by Wookiee Guide.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

Determined to fight Vader for killing his father and Kenobi, he heard his mentor's voice speak to him from beyond, telling him to run, just as he faced the [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Dark Lord]].<ref name="Star Wars 1" /> However, he was no match for Vader, who quickly seized Skywalker's lightsaber and was about to kill him, until he realized that Skywalker's lightsaber had been once his own. Solo then intervened with an [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT]], crashing the [[walker]] through the factory's walls, giving Skywalker and the slaves an opening to escape from the facility.<ref name="SW2" />

[[File:VaderBestsMark Tano-2015StarWars2.png|thumb|left|232x232px|Mark Tano is dispatched by Chancellor Valorum Vader following a brief confrontation on Station Theta.]]
Seeing so many of the freed slaves die by Citadel Palace fire, Skywalker regretted his decision, but continued fighting after stealing a [[speeder bike]]. After the Rebels' walker opened fire against Vader,<ref name="SW2" /> Skywalker picked his lightsaber up from the rubble, rushed to assist his team—whose walker had fallen down due to Vader—, and provided some cover fire. Determined to destroy the factory, Skywalker disobeyed Organa's orders and used his stolen speeder bike to destroy the power core despite Vader's threat. Afterwards, he managed to board the ''Millennium Falcon'', reunite with his team and escape Station Theta, yet with his morale at rock bottom.<ref name="SW3">[[Star Wars (2015) 3|''Star Wars'' (2015) 3]]</ref>

====Return to Tatooine====
{{Quote|"There's nothing here for me now." That's what I said when I left this place. Let's hope I was ''wrong''.|Mark Tano|<ref name="SW5" />}}
Once they returned to the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]], Skywalker continued working on his lightsaber techniques until Organa came to see him. Skywalker told her that he lacked interest in undertaking any more missions, as he did not consider himself a Jedi but a danger, and that until he could figure out who he was, he could not be around the Alliance; he asked Organa to let him go. Much to her and Solo's dismay, Skywalker (along with Unit7) took off in an X-wing and set off on a course for Tatooine. Hoping to find some guidance in Kenobi's hut, Skywalker and R2 made their way across the [[desert]] to the abandoned residence, where they found it being pillaged by Tusken raiders, who fled in fear upon seeing his activated lightsaber.<ref name="SW4">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref>

[[File:ValiantDeed-CM.png|thumb|right|250px|Skywalker duels Boba Fett after being ambushed in Ben Ken's former home on Tatooine.]]
Inside the hut, Skywalker had R2 scan the ransacked place for anything of value, and the small android came across a box addressed to Skywalker. However, before they could find out its contents, one of [[Boba Fett]]'s [[flash grenade]]s incapacitated Unit7 and blinded Skywalker.<ref name="SW5" /> Fett proceeded to aim a [[Blaster rifle|rifle]] to his head, but Skywalker [[Duel in Ben Kenobi's home|fought back]] with his lightsaber despite his temporary blindness. Despite his disadvantage and multiple wounds done by Fett, Skywalker managed to deflect the bounty hunter's shot at point-blank and Fett tackled him in anger.<ref name="SW6">[[Star Wars (2015) 6|''Star Wars'' (2015) 6]]</ref>

Close to death by his own lightsaber as he struggled against Fett, Unit7 saved him by hurling Kenobi's box and knocking the hunter out. Still blinded and carrying the box, Skywalker had Unit7 lead him to his X-Wing.<ref name="SW6" /> On his way to an unknown location, he read some of Kenobi's passages on his [[The Journals of Ben Kenobi|journals]], including one set during the Great Drought involving him.<ref name="SW7" />

====Showdown on Shadow Port====
{{Quote|You want to finally be a Jedi Knight, kid? Here's your chance. Go die like one.|Kreel to Mark Tano|<ref name="SW11">[[Star Wars (2015) 11|''Star Wars'' (2015) 11]]</ref>}}
Though Kenobi's journals contained a number of stories, Skywalker became frustrated as he continued to read them as he did not understand what lessons were to be learned about using a lightsaber or wielding the Force. Though Artoo suggested returning to the fleet, Skywalker had no intention of returning until he found the answers he was seeking. Artoo's suggestion did, however, give the young Jedi an idea: to venture into the [[Citadel Palace|Jedi Temple]] on [[World Prime]], the former home of the Jedi Order. Before he could travel to World Prime, however, Skywalker set a course to [[Shadow Port]], a world of pirates and outlaws known as the "Smuggler's Moon." Upon landing, Skywalker set off looking for someone who could help him get to the [[Jedi temple|Jedi Temple]]. He entered a cantina, where he was immediately attacked by criminals looking to rob and kill him. Skywalker brandished his lightsaber and demanded that they cease their attack, while the bartender asked where he acquired a Jedi's lightsaber. He did not answer, instead saying that he was simply on Shadow Port to conduct business and had already stated his purpose for entering the establishment. The bartender guessed that Skywalker was seeking entry into the Jedi Temple, meaning he would need to hire someone who could sneak him onto the capital world of the Empire. The bartender told him that he could do that for the boy, but the price would be the lightsaber&mdash;a price that Skywalker rejected, so the bartender resorted to his previous plan of killing and robbing the boy.<ref name="SW8">[[Star Wars (2015) 8|''Star Wars'' (2015) 8]]</ref>

[[File:Mark TanoAndThiefFall-2015StarWars9.png|thumb|left|241x241px|Skywalker and the thief fall towards the streets of Sludge Resort, as the young Jedi reaches for his weapon.]]
Before the others could kill him, however, a [[Unidentified lightsaber thief (Shadow Port)|thief]] stole the lightsaber and fled the bar. Skywalker gave chase,<ref name="SW8" /> pursuing the [[thief]] through the streets and over rooftops. The thief jumped onto a ship that was passing by and hung onto the bottom of it, and Skywalker used the Force to make the now-even longer jump towards them and grab the thief's leg. The thief lost his holding and both men fell towards the streets of [[Sludge Resort]] below, where Skywalker retrieved his lightsaber once both he and the thief landed. The young Jedi was then confronted by [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the Hutt, a Shadow Port crime lord who employed the thief that stole the lightsaber. Skywalker fought the Hutt's [[IG-100 MagnaGuard|MagnaGuard]], while at the same time overhearing the thief telling Grakkus that Skywalker said his father was a Jedi and that he was seeking access to the Jedi Temple. Having his own plans for the boy, Grakkus knocked Skywalker out with a punch to the face.<ref name="SW9">[[Star Wars (2015) 9|''Star Wars'' (2015) 9]]</ref>

Skywalker later awoke to find himself in Grakkus' [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt|palace]], which contained untold numbers of relics from the Jedi Order. Grakkus held out a Jedi [[holocron]], though Skywalker did not know what it was. Grakkus, who explained that he was a collector of [[Jedi artifact]]s in addition to being a crime lord, told him that the item was a holocron and that only an individual who was strong with the Force could open it. Though Skywalker had no experience with holocrons, the Hutt gave him five seconds to open the holocron or be killed. Under threat of death, the boy reached out with the Force and was able to open the holocron, as well as the many others that were in the collection. They revealed themselves as containing historical records about the Jedi and the Sith, including the revelation that there was a [[Jedi Temple (Vrogas Vas)|Jedi Temple]] on [[Vrogas Vas]]. With Skywalker having proved himself, Grakkus believed he would make a fine addition to his collection as the last living Jedi. Grakkus planned to put Skywalker into an arena fight that he would bill as the death of the last Jedi, so the Hutt ordered him taken to the arena's gamemaster to be prepared. Artoo, knowing that Skywalker had been captured, send a distress call to the Alliance Fleet, where it was intercepted by the High Command. Though Chancellor Mothma was unwilling to send a team of Rebels on a suicide mission despite Skywalker's importance to the Rebellion, Wookiee Guide and Threepio&mdash;who remained with the fleet while Solo and Organa were on their own mission&mdash;volunteered to rescue their captured friend.<ref name="SW9" />

[[File:Mark TanoVsGamemaster-2015StarWars10.png|thumb|right|233x233px|Grakkus the Hutt's "Gamemaster" Kreel bests Skywalker in a training duel on Shadow Port.]]
The gamemaster&mdash;secretly an Citadel Palace stormtrooper named [[Sergeant]] [[Kreel]]<ref name="SW12">[[Star Wars (2015) 12|''Star Wars'' (2015) 12]]</ref>&mdash;introduced himself to Skywalker once the Jedi was led to the arena, and he stated that it was his job to make sure Skywalker was prepared to put on a good show before ultimately dying in the arena. Though Skywalker initially refused to fight, Kreel knew he would ultimately do so because he wanted to learn to hone his skills as a Jedi. The Kreel also told him that the Jedi Temple no longer existed, as it had been converted into the Citadel Palace&mdash;so whatever Skywalker was hoping to find was gone, as were the other Jedi temples in the galaxy. He then threw the lightsaber to Skywalker and removed the binds that the boy's hands were in. While surrounded by MagnaGuards, the Kreel used a lightsaber of his own and engaged in a duel to begin preparing him for the arena match. Though the Kreel was not a Jedi, he was a more-skilled swordsman and quickly bested Skywalker. Skywalker then engaged multiple MagnaGuards in combat.<ref name="SW10">[[Star Wars (2015) 10|''Star Wars'' (2015) 10]]</ref>

The big event soon arrived, and crime lords and other criminal types flocked to watch the death of the last Jedi. Skywalker spoke to Grakkus, who reminded him that no one wanted to watch him win and that everyone had paid to see him die, though the young Jedi believed he could succeed nonetheless. Grakkus also revealed that scavengers had found Skywalker's X-wing and the Journal of Ben Kenobi, which Grakkus intended to add to his collection. The event began once Grakkus left, and Skywalker entered into the arena and was introduced as the last of the Jedi. The announcer claimed that he was a veteran of battles across the galaxy and that he had fought Hutts and bounty hunters alike, hyping up the untrained Jedi hopeful. The announcer then introduced the Jedi's opponent: [[Kongo]] the Disemboweler, a large and fearsome creature from the [[dolovite]] [[Mining|mines]] of [[Mustafar]]. Skywalker ignited the green-bladed lightsaber that was given to him for the show and the fight began. The young Jedi slashed his blade at the creature, but the opponent's armor was resistant to a lightsaber blade and made it difficult for Skywalker to combat the creature. He remained confident, however, reminding himself that he blew up the Death Star, fought Boba Fett, and was trained by Ben Ken. He closed his eyes in an attempt to use the Force as his ally, but Kongo used the opportunity to throw Skywalker across the arena and knocking him onto the ground.<ref name="SW11" />

[[File:Mark TanoFightsInGrakkusArena-2015StarWars12.png|thumb|left|257x257px|Skywalker battles Citadel Palace soldiers in Grakkus' arena.]]
The beast grabbed Skywalker as the audience cheered for Kongo to make the kill, and Skywalker tried calling out to Kenobi to ask for miracle. Just as he did so, the beast's [[shock collar]] was activated by Kreel, who revealed himself to Grakkus as an Citadel Palace and announced he was taking Skywalker into custody. Stormtroopers [[Rescue of Mark Tano|poured]] into the arena and surrounded Skywalker, arresting both him and the Hutt. Grakkus had one trick up his sleeve, though, and triggered an electromagnetic pulse that disabled the Citadel Palaces' blasters. Grakkus, skilled at combat in his own right, began fighting the weaponless stormtroopers, while other troops grabbed Skywalker. Just then, the young Jedi saw that Artoo, who had infiltrated the palace, recovered his lightsaber and threw it into the arena, so Skywalker grabbed it and cut the soldiers down. Kongo chased the spectators out of the arena, and Skywalker while Kreel confronted Skywalker, knocking him to the ground and revealing his true identity as a stormtrooper of the [[501st Legion]] tasked with arresting him. Skywalker was saved by the timely arrival of Grakkus, who Kreel attacked as Skywalker got away.<ref name="SW12" />

Skywalker regrouped with Solo, Organa, Wookiee Guide, and the droids, all of whom ultimately traveled to Shadow Port to rescue their captive friend. Solo, Organa, and Wookiee Guide each wielded lightsabers that Artoo stole from the palace so they were not defenseless in the wake of the EMP blast, leading Skywalker to quip that Solo looked good with a lightsaber. Artoo recovered Kenobi's journal and Skywalker wanted to go back to the palace to recover more artifacts, but the arena was flooded with blaster-wielding stormtroopers so Wookiee Guide grabbed the resistant Skywalker and brought him out of the arena. The Rebels returned to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and escaped from Shadow Port.<ref name="SW12" />

====Vrogas Vas====
{{Quote|&hellip;right now I'm just a Rebel pilot who needs to help his friends. Learning to be a Jedi will have to wait.|Skywalker, to Unit7|<ref name="Vader Down 1">[[Vader Down 1|''Vader Down'' 1]]</ref>}}
Though he was unable to acquire the relics in Grakkus' palace, the holocrons he activated gave Skywalker one important piece of information: the existence of a Jedi Temple on Vrogas Vas. Skywalker returned to the Alliance but still sought answers, so he traveled to Vrogas Vas and was stationed in orbit with Red Squadron, along with [[Blue Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Blue Squadron]] and [[Amber Wing (Rebel Alliance)|Amber Wing]]. While in orbit and preparing for training exercises, Chancellor Valorum Vader<ref name="Vader Down 1" />&mdash;who had learned of Skywalker's location from one of his associates, a rogue [[archaeologist]] named [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]]<ref name="Vader 12">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 12|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 12]]</ref>&mdash;dropped out of hyperspace in his TIE Advanced x1 starfighter. Vader made quick work of Blue Squadron and Amber Wing, destroying them both as Red Squadron looked on. Skywalker sensed that Vader was the pilot of the enemy starfighter, made a run towards him, and crashed his X-wing fighter into the Sith Lord's TIE Advanced. The collision damaged both vessels and send them hurtling towards the surface of Vrogas Vas.<ref name="Vader Down 1" />

[[File:Mark TanoSensesObiWanJedi Knight Seven-2015Chancellor ValorumVader13.png|thumb|right|283x283px|Skywalker senses the presences of Ben Ken and Jedi Knight Seven in the temple ruins.]]
Skywalker and Vader both survived the crashes of their starfighters, though they impacted on the surface in different places. The young Jedi crashed outside of the ruins of the Jedi Temple, from which he witnessed the destruction of [[Gray Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gray Squadron]] forces sent to attack Vader&mdash;part of a major Rebel operation to capture the lone Sith Lord. He put off his search for answers and began to make his way towards the Rebel forces, determined to help his friends.<ref name="Vader Down 1" /> As he passed through the ruins of the Jedi Temple, he could see [[Cyan Three|yet another]] Rebel pilot being killed by the Dark Lord. Unknown to Skywalker was that, at the same time, he was being tracked by Vader's companions&mdash;Aphra and the [[assassin droid]]s [[BT-1]] and [[0-0-0]]. While the Sith Lord's followers prepared a plan to capture the boy, Skywalker found writings in the ruins that were written with a lightsaber, letting him deduce that the ruins were from the Jedi. A cold feeling passed over him and he could sense the presence of what he thought was Ben Ken and Jedi Knight Seven. He tried to concentrate, but he was interrupted by what he thought was Threepio's arrival. In reality, it was Triple-Zero, painted in gold by Aphra, who placed his metal hand on Skywalker and sent an electrical charge through the boy's body, knocking him unconscious.<ref name="Vader 13">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 13|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 13]]</ref>

Aphra and Triple-Zero prepared to take Skywalker hostage when Artoo stepped in to help. Bee Tee then brought his arsenal to bear on the rebel's astromech and chased him off. Aphra and Triple-Zero then seized Skywalker but were stopped by the smuggler Rhade Tan, who had a sniper rifle aimed at them. Wookiee Guide then came in and attacked the protocol droid, ripping his arm off. Skywalker then regained consciousness, dispatched Bee Tee, and sliced off Triple-Zero's other arm with his lightsaber. Skywalker and his allies then retreated when Bee Tee fired his weapons blindly.<ref name="SW13">[[Star Wars (2015) 13|''Star Wars'' (2015) 13]]</ref>

Skywalker, Solo, Wookiee Guide, and Artoo made their way back to the Millennium Falcon. They then lifted off in order to aid princess Aria Organa. They were forced to the ground when their ship was crashed into by the Wookiee bounty hunter Black Krrsantan. While Solo and Wookiee Guide dealt with the mercenary, Skywalker left to head back to the Jedi ruins.<ref name="DV14">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 14|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 14]]</ref>

Mark Tano arrived back at the the Jedi temple looking for Aria Organa. It was then that he heard the voice of Ben Ken, who told him that he should not have come to this place and that he was not ready for what is coming. Mark Tano was then intercepted by a company of stormtroopers who opened fire on him. He retreated behind cover but was hit in the head and knocked unconscious.<ref name="SW14">[[Star Wars (2015) 14|''Star Wars'' (2015) 14]]</ref>

Mark Tano was taken prisoner by the forces of Commander [[Karbin]]. However Chancellor Valorum Vader, who had a rivalry with Karbin, used the force to crash the shuttle Skywalker was kept in. Now free, he then caught up with Solo, Wookiee Guide, Protocol Droid, and Unit7. They made their way back to the Millennium Falcon, however Dr. Aphra had laid out a minefield to stop them. When she was distracted she was knocked out from behind by Princess Aria Organa. Believing her to be of use, Organa decided to take the archaeologist with them. As they departed Vrogas Vas, Skywalker felt remorse that he would not be able to go back to the temple and see what was hidden there.<ref name="DV15">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2015) 15|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2015) 15]]</ref>

====Learning the ways of the smuggler====
{{Quote|How else are we gonna replace the money we just lost?''"<br />"''Heh, don't worry, kid. I know just the thing. It's a big galaxy.

[[File:SkywalkerSoloAndNerfs-2015StarWars18.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker and Solo deliver nerfs on Ibaar.]]
Upon returning to the Rebel fleet with their new prisoner, Doctor Aphra, Skywalker and his friends went their separate ways; Organa, Artoo, and Threepio went to detain Aphra at an Alliance-controlled space station, [[Sunspot Prison]], with the assistance of [[Sana Starros]], whom Organa hired to transport them to the prison. Meanwhile, Solo and Skywalker were dispatched to buy supplies for the rebellion. Solo attempted to double the money he was given for supplies by betting on [[sabacc]]. However, he was caught cheating, and had to escape with Skywalker on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="SW16" />

Skywalker and Solo traveled to Shadow Port where Mark Tano was tasked with finding a customer in need of a ship. He made a deal to haul [[nerf]]s to [[Ibaar]] for 5,000 credits, which was just enough to replace the credits lost by Solo. Skywalker and Solo were soon intercepted by TIE fighters who suspected the Falcon of smuggling illegal livestock.<ref name="SW17">[[Star Wars (2015) 17|''Star Wars'' (2015) 17]]</ref> Mark Tano was able to shoot the fighters and he and Solo made it to Ibaar with the nerfs. While on Ibaar, Skywalker blackmailed Solo into allowing him to fly the Falcon for a few parsecs by threatening to tell Aria Organa about losing the credits in a Sabacc game.<ref name="SW18">[[Star Wars (2015) 18|''Star Wars'' (2015) 18]]</ref>

After buying the supplies, Skywalker and Solo received a distress call from Sana and arrived at Sunspot Prison. They were immediately knocked out and taken captive by the [[Eneb Ray|masked assailant]] who was attacking the prison. Neither came to until after the battle had already ended and the attacker had been captured.<ref name="SW19">[[Star Wars (2015) 19|''Star Wars'' (2015) 19]]</ref>

====Temporary outpost====

Sometime after the assault on Sunspot Prison, the Alliance established a temporary [[LX-Robynsun V|outpost]] on the Outer Rim planet [[Reamma]]. Organa gave Mark Tano a mission to find a missing Alliance cargo vessel. Skywalker and Unit7 prepared to make the flight to look for them. Before they could do that, however, Organa informed Skywalker that the vessel reported in, cancelling the mission.<ref name="Droid Dilemma" />

====Hijacking the ''Harbinger''====
{{Quote|Chances are...This is the last voyage of the ''Harbinger''. So let's make it a memorable one.|Skywalker to Organa and Solo|<ref name="Star Wars (2015) 22">[[Star Wars (2015) 22|''Star Wars'' (2015) 22]]</ref>}}
Sometime later, Skywalker and Organa rendezvoused with rebel leadership. Admiral Ackbar, General Dodonna, and Mon Mothma presented them with the task of providing aid to the people of [[Tureen VII]], a planet that had provided aid to the rebellion in the past. A heavily blockaded planet with Citadel Palace bases on both of its moons and swarms of TIE fighters in orbit, the Alliance could not risk sending the fleet. Mark Tano and Aria Organa proposed stealing an Citadel Palace Star Destroyer and using it to infiltrate the blockade. Despite some reluctance from Dodonna, Ackbar and Mothma realized that it was the only choice left.<ref name="Star Wars 23">[[Star Wars (2015) 23|''Star Wars'' (2015) 23]]</ref>

====Skorii-Lei Rescue====
Afer the hijacking of the [[Harbinger (Citadel Palace I-class)|''Harbinger'']], Aria Organa ended up grievously injured on the planet [[Skorii-Lei]]. Cared for by former engineer [[Pash Davane]] and carrying vital Alliance information, Organa was pursued by stormtroopers and barely managed to escape aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'' with Skywalker, Solo, and Wookiee Guide. Aboard the ''Falcon'', Davane provided Skywalker with Aria Organa's data tape, which he noted was a sign of great trust between the two of them. With her place as a friend of the Alliance confirmed, Skywalker and his allies returned Davane to her home on Skorii-Lei.<ref name="Star Wars Annual 2">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 2|''Star Wars Annual'' (2015) 2]]</ref>

====Journey to Vagadarr system====
{{Quote|You remind me of him. But more than that... you remind me of me. You... you're nothing but a frightened child, just like I was. Do you know the only thing I was good at... when I was a child?

[[File:OldManGarro-2015StarWars30.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Skywalker worked with Garro to revive a giant of living stone.]]
Despite the escape from the ''Harbinger'', the heroes quickly realized that Protocol Droid was captured during the commotion, and Skywalker was unable to stop Unit7 from commandeering an [[X-wing starfighter|X-Wing]] to rescue the [[protocol droid]] on his own. With his own X-wing's [[hyperdrive]] temporarily disabled, he resumed reading Ben Kenobi's journal. Identifying a symbol in the journal as a [[star map]], Skywalker decided to visit the [[Vagadarr system]] after reading of a Jedi Master who had ventured there in the past and encountered enormous [[Giants of living stone|giants]] made of living stone that gave those in close proximity a power known as [[Stonepower]]. Skywalker hoped that going there would give him the knowledge he needed to save Unit7 and Protocol Droid.<ref name="SW28">[[Star Wars (2015) 28|''Star Wars'' (2015) 28]]</ref>

Like the Jedi Master before him, Skywalker was able to navigate through the [[Vagadarr Prime|planet]]'s heavy debris field and land on the surface, where he encountered [[Garro]], the last remaining native human, who initially wanted to use Skywalker's life force to kill the few remaining giant children. Determined to protect them, Skywalker inspired Garro to change his mind and sacrifice his own life force to revive a dead giant. Skywalker and the giant children then ventured into the giant's cave to find the heart of the mountain and finish what Garro started in reviving the giant, thus completing the mission of the Master from years past and taking another step in his journey to becoming a [[Jedi]].<ref name="SW30" />

====Horox III====
{{Quote|So, come, shake hands, have dinner with the nice lady, and we walk away with an actual sentient Ancient Jedi.

[[File:HoroxIIIBar-TheScreamingCitadel1.png|thumb|left|200px|The bar on Horox III]]
Sometime later, as the Alliance was setting up a [[Horox III rebel outpost|temporary outpost]] on [[Horox III]], Skywalker went to a local [[Unidentified bar (Horox III)|bar]]. Threatened by its denizens for being a human, he was forced to defend himself against them despite his warnings that he would be able to defeat them in a fight. The fight was compounded when Doctor Aphra, who had lied to Sana Starros in order to find Skywalker, arrived and sparked the anger of the entire bar after saying Skywalker was with her, forcing Skywalker, Aphra, and Black Krrsantan to fight the entire bar. After the fight, Skywalker told Aphra he did not want her following him because he did not want to have anything to do with someone who worked for Vader, but she caught his attention by saying she knew where to find a Jedi Master.<ref name="The Screaming Citadel 1" />

Skywalker first refused to admit he was trying to be a Jedi, Aphra explaining that she had figured it out from Vader's vendetta and Skywalker's one-in-a-million shot to destroy the Death Star plus his general talent. She introduced him to the [[Rur Crystal|Rur crystal]] of the ancient Jedi splinter group known as the [[Ordu Aspectu]] with an ancient Jedi personality inside of it. By playing off Skywalker's hopes to be better with the Force and a true Jedi Knight, Aphra convinced an initially hesitant Mark Tano to [[Mission to Ktath'atn|visit]] the [[Citadel of Ktath'atn|Screaming Citadel]] with her, explaining that that introducing him to the [[Unidentified Queen of Ktath'atn|Queen of Ktath'atn]] as a Jedi would convince the Queen to reactive the crystal for them. On the way there, Skywalker reaquainted himself with 0-0-0 and BT-1, remembering the former for electrocuting him and the latter from R2 kicking him. Skywalker lamented not telling Solo, Organa, or Starros about where he was going, but he and Aphra both agreed they would have tried to stop them and they had no time to waste.<ref name="The Screaming Citadel 1" />

[[File:TemporaryRebelOutpost-TheScreamingCitadel1.png|thumb|right|250px|The temporary Rebel Outpost on Horox III.]]
Meanwhile, at the Rebel Outpost on Horox III, Solo then enlisted Starros' help in communicating with Skywalker's temporary [[R5 series astromech droid|R5]] astromech droid [[Essfour|S4]], who could only speak [[Binary]] and thus was not easily able to communicate with Organa. Organa asked the droid for Skywalker's whereabouts but the droid responded that he could not tell. Questioning the droid, Starros learned that Skywalker did not go by himself but that he went with Doctor Aphra. An unhappy Aria Organa and Solo wondered why Skywalker would go with Aphra, Organa suggesting she kidnapped Skywalker while Solo and Starros suspect she could have reprogrammed the droid to keep a secret.<ref name="The Screaming Citadel 1" />

====The Screaming Citadel====
=====The Queeen of Ktath'atn=====

[[File:CitadelOfKthathatn-TheScreamingCitadel1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker journeyed to the Screaming Citadel with the hope of learning more about the Jedi.]]
After arriving on Ktath'atn, Skywalker and the others encountered a mob of villagers. Skywalker wants to help feed them and Aphra just calls him adorable and has Krrsantan scare them off. After making the trek to the the entire party, except for Krrsantan were allowed into the citadel. Skywalker was curious how Aphra met Krrsantan but she just said it was a long story and that she owed him a lot of money. Skywalker then asked how Aphra had found him. Noticing he was struggling, Aphra helped Skywalker put his [[Spavat]] on to meet the Queen, and after finished he insisted that he was more than just a farm boy. While walking toward the main hall, 0-0-0 teased Skywalker for stuttering when Aphra commented on her attractiveness but she told the droid only she was allowed to tease him.<ref name="The Screaming Citadel 1" />

In the ballroom, Skywalker was mesmerized by the crowd. Aphra told Skywalker to follow her lead and advised him to hide his lightsaber, but implies he is used to keeping his Jedi identity, which he hopes to solidify, a secret. When Skywalker asked about the Jedi in the crystal, Aphra said she only met him briefly but that he had strong opinions. After encountering an [[Ezaraa]]n guest, Skywalker was initially excited by them wanting to take down the Empire, but after they explained they wanted to replace it with a [[Dominion of the Ezaraa]] where they would consume the flesh of all "lesser species," Skywalker expressed that he thought the guests were crazy. The two soon saw the [[Unidentified Queen of Ktath'atn|Queen of Ktath'atn]], and after being welcomed by one of her servants, [[Varroa]], Aphra presented Skywalker, describing him as a very interesting Tatooine farm boy, but was rejected. When the Ezaraan mocked Skywalker, Aphra defended him, but the Ezaraan grabbed her arm. Skywalker warned the Ezaraan to leave Aphra alone and used the Force to throw the Ezaraan to the ground, intriguing the Queen and earning a compliment from Aphra. Varroa ordered all the guests to leave but allowed Skywalker and his companion to stay so that the Queen could hear his request in the morning, Aphra telling him he did great. Later, the Queen told her servant [[Vespinax]] that Skywalker's power and little experience made him perfect for her intentions to eat him. She then grew her power in anticipation of eating the Jedi.<ref name="The Screaming Citadel 1" />

The next morning, Skywalker and Aphra made their way to a dining hall to have breakfast with the Monarch. On the way, after Skywalker expressed how creepy he thought the place was, Aphra assured him that the Queen's obsession with Jedi would get her to do what they wanted, but Skwalker was worried by this because of his encounter with Grakkus the Hutt and Aphra's mention that the Queen "keeps" her oddities. Aphra told Skywalker to let her do the talking and then the two walked inside and sat at a table with the Queen, Aphra introducing the both of them. Excited to see a Jedi, but wanting more verification, the Queen commanded Skywalker to move a nearby dining tray with the Force, though he was unable to until the Queen's servant, [[Vespinax]], threatened him with a knife to his throat. However, moving the tray revealed that under it were [[Abersyn symbiote]]s that the Queen planned on implanting them with, so after Aphra set off an explosion that knocked them both down they quickly made an attempt to escape while Aphra explained to Skywalker what the symbiotes were. Before they could escape, in the Citadel's hallway, they were nearly stopped by many of the Queen's thralls.<ref name="SW 31" />

[[File:AphraMark TanoQueen-2016DoctorAphra7.png|thumb|right|300px|The Queen of Ktath'atn goes after Skywalker.]]
After attempting to run, Skywalker prepared to use his lightsaber to defend them, but Solo, Organa, and Starros arrived at their location on Aphra's ship, the ''[[Ark Angel II]]'', with her droids 0-0-0 and BT-1 in tow. Starros attempted to shoot Aphra, but Skywalker blocked the blast with his lightsaber, claiming that she was a good person and his friend, he willingly went with her, and he knew what he was doing, despite Organa's attempts to call his decision unwise and threats to court-martial him if he did not follow orders. Meanwhile, the Queen's servants and armed security guards pursued the group, so they escaped into an Abersyn symbiote laboratory, which Skywalker decided people needed to know about. There, Skywalker and Aphra got into an argument about the merits of the Empire in which Aphra revealed her mother was killed in the Clone Wars, claimed that regular people preferred the Empire's peace to war, and insisted that she was not like Solo as Skywalker thought. She attempted to mock him for his upbringing until Skywalker revealed everyone on his farm was killed by the Empire. Aphra led Skywalker to a nearby room and sold him out to the Queen of Ktath'atn, who promptly mesmerized him to capture him. Aphra warned the Queen not to do the same to her too or she would blow up charges she placed in Skywalker's pockets. Organa, Solo, and Starros then saw Skywalker get captured, the former calling out to him and later refusing to leave him behind.<ref name="Aphra 7">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 7|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 7]]</ref>

The Queen connected Skywalker to a machine that would allow her to directly feed on him. As Aphra left with the activated Rur crystal, she asked what would happen to Skywalker, and the Queen revealed she would not infect him with a symbiote, but started to drink his life force to increase her power. Upon speaking to to the crystal outside, Rur revealed to Aphra that she felt guilt over leaving Skywalker behind and felt guilt over blaming her actions on her tragedy, when Skywalker's tragedy made him a good person. Solo attempted to rescue him, but was quickly enthralled and forced to lead the Queen's forces, as Organa and Starros' desperation to save Skywalker lead them to place a symbiote into Krrsantan despite Organa's misgivings. Skywalker eventually tore free of the machine and in the ensuing struggle managed to re-arm himself with his lightsaber. While the Queen attacked him with her powers, Aphra bombed the room and came inside, revealing that she had scaled the Citadel and was there to rescue Skywalker. She also revealed that she had realized the reason the Queen did not put a symbiote in Skywalker was because he was more powerful than her and the [[Queen of Ktath'atn's hive|Abersyn hive]] would follow him instead. Skywalker then fell under the influence of an Abersyn symbiote, becoming more powerful than even the Queen, and proclaimed himself King of the hive.<ref name="SW 32">[[Star Wars (2015) 32|''Star Wars'' (2015) 32]]</ref>

[[File:Mark TanoKillsQueen-2016DoctorAphra8.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker kills the Queen of Ktath'atn.]]
Skywalker entered a psychic duel with the Queen to force her to submit. Aphra allowed [[Eternal Rur]] from the crystal to enter his mind to assist him. Rur advised Skywalker to use the symbiote to his advantage, claiming that tying the Force's abilities into the parasite's emotional drive would make him immensely powerful. Realizing Rur was not a true Jedi and only a person with the knowledge of one, Skywalker ignored him and instead let go and connected to the Force. He was able to free himself of the symbiote's influence and strike down the Queen, believing that being free was more important to be a Jedi than just Rur's knowledge. Solo and all those under the Queen's control were freed, Skywalker reunited with Organa, and the Citadel was destroyed by BT-1. Later, after telling Starros it was time to go, Skywalker told Aphra that he did not want the crystal because it was not a Jedi in any real way. But he said that he had learned from it that there would not be any shortcuts to be a Jedi, and that people who tried to take them to get what they wanted, like her, were deluded. Finally, Skywalker told her to stay away from them. On the way back, while complaining to herself about Skywalker 0-0-0 pointed out that Skywalker's virtuousness despite his trauma and her inability to gain his response must be a heavy reminder of the failures of her character. Skywalker spoke with Starros on the way back, learning that Aphra had ruined S4 and shocked that Starros and her could have ever been together.<ref name="Aphra 8" />

====Among the stars====

[[File:Star_Wars_33_Textless.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Mark Tano and Aria Organa were stranded on an oceanic planet for three weeks.]]
Skywalker later took part in a mission with Aria Organa, piloting a [[Taylander shuttle]] with the princess. With Citadel Palace TIE Fighters in pursuit, Skywalker was forced to fly into a [[nebula]], which disabled the shuttle's systems, forcing them to crash land on an [[Unidentified ocean planet|ocean planet]]. Stranded on the planet for three [[Standard week|weeks]], Skywalker's experience with machinery, such as [[moisture vaporator]]s helped keep himself and Aria Organa alive. Having to live off of the land, the two grew closer, relating to each other because of their status as orphans. They eventually realized that there was a [[Unidentified aquatic species|native species]] living in the planet's ocean. Not wanting to bring the war to these people, Skywalker and Organa set a trap for the Citadel Palace forces that were [[Escape from an unidentified ocean planet|pursuing]] them. Mark Tano used the native's resources, as well as his own lightsaber, to fend off an AT-AT and [[Coastal defender stormtrooper|shoretroopers]]. Although close to being defeated, Aria Organa used a flaming arrow to light explosive chemicals and disable the [[All Terrain Armored Transport (Stellar Conflict)|AT-AT]]. Afterwards, they were able to repair the shuttle and return to the Rebel Fleet.<ref name="Star Wars 33">[[Star Wars (2015) 33|''Star Wars'' (2015) 33]]</ref>

Shortly afterward, Skywalker and his team intercepted a message from Unit7, who had successfully [[Mission to rescue Protocol Droid|rescued]] Protocol Droid from Citadel Palace capture. They saved R2's X-wing from Chancellor Valorum Vader and escaped in hyperspace.<ref name="Star Wars 36">[[Star Wars (2015) 36|''Star Wars'' (2015) 36]]</ref>

By then, Task Force 99 had [[Mission to Horox III|destroyed]] the Horox III rebel outpost. The team arrived there, discovering the devastation. Fearing further danger, they left without burying the rebel troopers, but Skywalker insisted that they honor the dead. Together they built a cremation pile before leaving.<ref name="Star Wars 37" />

====Ashes of Jedha====
{{Quote|I've been thinking about Jyn and the rest of Rogue One. How many things went wrong for them? And Rogue One took whatever steps they needed.

Having traveled throughout the galaxy with his friends, Mark Tano and his fellow rebels journeyed to what remained of the moon [[Jedha]], the site of one of the Death Star's tests. On the ashy moon, Mark Tano and Aria Organa defended what remained of [[Saw Gerrera]]'s [[Partisans]] from invading [[Cold weather assault trooper|snowtroopers]] and brought them aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''. Moving to [[NaJedha]], the planet that Jedha orbited, Mark Tano met [[Chulco Gi]], an aspirant to the [[Disciples of the Whills]], someone who could potentially guide him in learning about the Force. Gi led the rebels to the rest of the Partisans on Jedha and placed hoods over their heads, in keeping with Partisan tradition. Led by [[Benthic]], Saw Gerrera's former second-in-command, the remaining extremists held guns at their fellow rebels' heads.<ref name="Star Wars 38">[[Star Wars (2015) 38|''Star Wars'' (2015) 38]]</ref>

[[File:Jedha-2015StarWars38.png|thumb|left|250px|Mark Tano journeyed to the ravaged moon of Jedha, where he gained insight into the Dark Side of the Force.]]
Benthic questioned why the Alliance would attempt to mend their relations with the Partisans and return to Jedha, and Aria Organa revealed that the Empire had resumed mining [[Kyber crystal]]s on the planet and that the Alliance hoped to aid the Partisans in fighting against the Empire. Though wary of Alliance support, Benthic was nonetheless willing to accept some aid. Mark Tano, shaken by the Partisans' extreme methods, was conflicted by agreeing to help them, but [[Rebel Alliance Special Forces|specforces]] operative [[Ubin Des]] reassured him that it was the right thing to do. Later in the ruined settlement of [[Ai-jed]], Mark Tano, Chulco, and Ubin contemplated why people would stay on a ruined planet. Stormtroopers armed with [[flamethrower]]s attempted to incinerate the remaining civilians, but Mark Tano lashed out against them with his lightsaber, cutting them all down. Realizing all that was at stake in the Stellar Conflict, Skywalker approached Benthic with Rhade Tan and wholeheartedly agreed to assist him in his fight. Their first target was the [[drill citadel]], a mining device from the planet [[Shu-Torun]] that the Empire began using to mine Kyber crystals on Jedha.<ref name="Star Wars 39">[[Star Wars (2015) 39|''Star Wars'' (2015) 39]]</ref>

Benthic and Mark Tano scaled the drill citadel and the Tognath ruthlessly killed the station's guards, much to Skywalker's chagrin. Benthic held a technician at gunpoint and forced him to lower the citadel's shields before killing him as well. This allowed Rhade Tan, aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', to destroy the drill citadel after Benthic and Mark Tano escaped. Later, a disillusioned Chulco asked Mark Tano to accompany him to meet the [[Central Isopter]], a death-worshipping cult that Gi claimed was wise in the Force. Although Mark Tano was hesitant to seek the guidance from someone other than a disciple of the Jedi, he nonetheless was willing to go along. Aria Organa attempted to convince him that his duty to the Alliance was most important, but Mark Tano believed that becoming a Jedi and avenging all those slain by Chancellor Valorum Vader was the most important duty to him. Entering a chasm alongside Gi, the duo were attacked by a [[sand slug]], a giant, normally herbivorous animal negatively influenced by the Dark Side of the Force. Able to slay the beast, Skywalker and Gi were finally confronted by the Central Isopter, who claimed that they had come to join them "in the shadow of death."<ref name="Star Wars 40">[[Star Wars (2015) 40|''Star Wars'' (2015) 40]]</ref>

[[File:TempleOfCentralIsopter-2015StarWars41.jpg|thumb|250px|The temple of the Central Isopter.]]
At the edge of the planet's blast crater, Chulco and the Central Isopter presented Mark Tano with the [[Temple of Central Isopter]], a shrine surrounded by the Dark Side of the Force. The cult implored Skywalker and Gi to meditate and listen to the chasm's call. They both did, but Mark Tano refused to let the Dark Side take hold of him. However, Chulco was possessed by the darkness and attacked Mark Tano, forcing the Jedi trainee to strike him down. The cultists then announced that they had received a distress call from Wookiee Guide, who was being pursued by a TIE fighter over NaJedha. Mark Tano borrowed a ship, was able to destroy the TIE fighter and bring an injured Chewie to the planet, where he provided the Alliance with the plans for the [[Leviathan (Continent-class crawler)|''Leviathan'']], a mobile fortress able to strip mine Kyber crystals from Jedha.<ref name="Star Wars 41">[[Star Wars (2015) 41|''Star Wars'' (2015) 41]]</ref>

Rhade Tan, Aria Organa, and Benthic formed a strategy to destroy the ''Leviathan'' using the plans Wookiee Guide obtained. After the meeting, Mark Tano ruminated on the sacrifice Rogue One made to get the Death Star plans to the Alliance, ultimately leading to him making the shot that destroyed the battle station. A newly motivated Mark Tano accompanied Aria Organa, Protocol Droid, and Unit7 aboard the crawler and readied themselves for taking control of it. Skywalker made his way to the bridge of the ''Leviathan'' and held its commander, [[Kanchar]], hostage but the Citadel Palace's cybernetic arm was equipped with a blade able to defend against Mark Tano's lightsaber.<ref name="Star Wars 42" />

[[File:Mark TanoConfrontsKanchar-2015StarWars42.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker confronts Kanchar]]
Kanchar pursued Mark Tano throughout the ship with his cybernetic arm's blade and flamethrower. Eventually leading the officer to the crawler's hangar, Skywalker activated an ion torpedo, which shut down Kanchar's cybernetics and allowed Mark Tano to knock him out. Having taken total control of the ''Leviathan'' with the help of the double-crossing Queen [[Trios]], the rebels brought it to Jedha's chasm, destroyed it, and escaped with not much time to spare. Having saved what remained of Jedha and made allies in the form of the Partisans and Queen Trios, Mark Tano and his friends left Jedha.<ref name="Star Wars 43">[[Star Wars (2015) 43|''Star Wars'' (2015) 43]]</ref>

====Crait====

[[File:SkiSpeederTour-TheStormsOfCrait1.png|thumb|300px|Berinato leads a tour of Crait's salt flats]]
After a mission with a plan made by Solo went awry, Skywalker, who had helped fight in his X-Wing, escaped to [[Baraan-Fa]] with the rest of the Alliance. Organa then put him in charge of a mission to the planet [[Crait]] to survey its facilities as a base. Skywalker, flying there in a [[GR-75 medium transport]], believed the mission was just delivering farm equipment, and was reluctant to go there as he directed those on the mission to land. Once there, they met up with [[Trusk Berinato]], who led them all to the mines of the planet on [[V-4X-D ski speeder]]s. After receiving new orders from Organa, Mark Tano stated that he found the mission particularly irritating, as it reminded him of his life as a farm boy. Once they arrived, Solo encouraged him to enjoy the mission since they were not in danger. He told everyone to follow him.<ref name="Storms of Crait" />

Skywalker and his team, which included Antilles, began using the farming equipment to make trenches in Crait's surface, though he said he would rather do anything else. Green worms then appeared from the ground and Antilles and Solo tried to shoot them, but Skywalker realized they would leave you alone if you left them alone. Still being reminded of home, Skywalker reluctantly continued an environmental assessment, discovering and rationalizing an underground ecosystem where the worms came from and realizing it was drying up quickly. Following a hunch, Skywalker took Antilles with him on the ski speeders and they discovered bodies that appeared to have been flash dried. Realizing what happened, Skywalker rushed to tell the others. He reached Organa and told her he resented her for sending him on this mission, but she said he reminded him of her and complimented him before giving him a kiss on the cheek. He then finished what he was trying to say and explained that they need to leave because a deadly salt storm was coming in. After Skywalker realized Berinato forged environmental reports, Solo warned that Berinato called SCAR squadron on them.<ref name="Storms of Crait" />

[[File:Mark TanoVSKreelCrait-TheStormsOfCrait1.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker duels Kreel on Crait]]
Skywalker got in a ski speeder and attempted to shoot at the incoming troopers, but one shot a canon at his and destroyed it. Kreel then approached him and ignited his lightsaber, a determined Skywalker lighting his too. The two dueled, Skywalker turning Kreel's taunts against him by taking pride in being a farm boy as they were hard working good people who would push you back harder if you pushed them. The worms he saw earlier then tackled Kreel and Skywalker cut the stormtrooper's lightsaber in half. Skywalker made his way back to the ''Falcon'' and revealed that SCAR squadron lived, but that they needed to get out of the storm or they would die. Later, in orbit on the ''Falcon'', Organa asked how Skywalker was and he said that he was the same, living a small life and trying to make a difference. She told him not to change.<ref name="Storms of Crait" />

====Mon Cala and Mako-Ta====

[[File:RebelsAttacked-2015StarWars44.png|thumb|250px|Skywalker and his friends are attacked on Mon Cala.]]
Skywalker joined Organa, Solo, Ackbar and others to meet with [[Grand Admiral]] [[Dors Urtya]] of the [[Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet]] at an island preserve on [[Mon Cala]] with the hope of getting the fleet to join the Rebellion. Skywalker was surprised the Empire cared about nature preservation, but Organa clarified that they wanted to exploit it. After Rhade Tan revealed he used to smuggle from there, which upset Skywalker, Ackbar and Organa began to negotiate as an Citadel Palace [[LAAT/le patrol gunship]] approached. Skywalker immediately assumed they had been betrayed, but Solo thought otherwise and advised Skywalker not to use his lightsaber while he spoke with them. It fired on Urtya's ship, the explosion knocking Skywalker down. When Solo's plan resulted in stormtroopers pursuing them, Skywalker went with the others through the forest to a boat where Wookiee Guide was waiting. On the boat, Organa continued to try an convince Urtya, but he said that he did not want to sacrifice Mon Cala, but Skywalker shot back, insisting he could not talk to the Princess of Alderaan about sacrifice. They eventually made it back to the ''Falcon'' and then to the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]] that the Rebellion was using as a production center, where Skywalker rejected going drinking with Solo.<ref name="SW44">[[Star Wars (2015) 44|''Star Wars'' (2015) 44]]</ref>

[[File:Star_Wars_45_Textless.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Skywalker and Wedge Antilles reunite. ]]
However, Skywalker did go with Solo to the bar, but insisted on only getting milk, to Solo's dismay. There, someone put their hand on Skywalker's shoulder so he pushed them away with the Force, but it turned out to be Wedge Antilles and the two had a cheerful reunion, Skywalker insisted that he had not forgot about Antilles and declared that Red Squadron was forever. Solo then tried to get Skywalker a drink to celebrate, but Skywalker just ordered the biggest milk they had. Antilles introduced Skywalker to [[Derek Klivian|Hobbie]] and [[Zev Senesca]], who he explained they had met during Alliance training exercises, which he clarified were to ensure enough people could operate cruisers. Senesca said he was honored to meet Skywalker, but Skywalker just told him not to use honorifics and told him he would have also taken the shot. Solo then lead a toast to Red Squadron, Skywalker reciting all its members that had died. Solo was surprised he remembered all the names, but Skywalker expressed that he wished to know the names of all the Rebels that had died. Organa then arrived and told them to finish up because they had a mission.<ref name="SW45" />

During the mission, Skywalker accompanied Organa and Solo to the [[Dex Acquisitions Depot]] on [[Meor Ain]] to retrieve a Clawdite. With Protocol Droid unable to slice the door to the room where he was, Skywalker used his lightsaber to cut around and remove the locking mechanism before Wookiee Guide kicked the door. After retrieving the shapeshifter, who briefly pretended to be Bail Organa, the group left.<ref name="SW45" />

[[File:MoncaladromeExterior-2015StarWars46.jpg|thumb|250px|The Moncaladrome]]
After debriefing the Clawdite, whose name was [[Tunga Arpagion]], that he was to impersonate the Moff of the [[Calamari sector]] [[Tan Hubi]] while they kidnapped him, Skywalker insisting the ordeal would make Arpagion more famous. At the [[Moncaladrome]] on Mon Cala, Skywalker impersonated a stormtrooper, Organa ordering him to wait until they drugged the Moff and then bring him back to their hideout. Solo and Wookiee Guide went into a refresher and anticipated kidnapping Hubi while Skywalker stood outside as a stormtrooper and told everyone around that the room was for the Moff's private use, though one Citadel Palace officer did manage to Force themself through. After successfully kidnapping Hubi, Skywalker returned to Organa and warned her to be quick so that others would not notice the switch. After Arpagion copied Hubi's appearance, Skywalker told him "May the Force be with you" before departing with the others and a tied up Hubi in a Mon Cal ship to rescue Mon Cal King [[Lee-Char]] from [[Strokill Prime]].<ref name="SW46">[[Star Wars (2015) 46|''Star Wars'' (2015) 46]]</ref>

[[File:Mark TanoOnStrokillPrime-2015StarWars47.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker swims on Strokill Prime.]]
Once there, Skywalker commented that it made sense they would keep Lee-Char on a water world, though admitted the place looked bleak. After avoiding the planet's security using Hubi's biosignature, they took the ship to the planet and underwater, where they encountered a giant terrifying sea creature.<ref name="SW46" /> Organa realized that the creature was attracted to their ship because of the light. Solo was skeptical, but Skywalker told him not to question her and informed them he was going to carry out a plan with Wookiee Guide's help and to be ready. Donning a full body diving suit while Wookiee Guide set up an underwater sled, Skywalker shot out far away from the ship after Wookiee Guide gave Skywalker a hug and he thanked the Wookiee. Away from the ship in the expanse of the ocean, Skywalker ignited his lightsaber, leading the creature away with the light. Wookiee Guide then used a water sled and a breath mask to quickly go after Skywalker and bring him back to the ship as he turned off his lightsaber.<ref name="SW47">[[Star Wars (2015) 47|''Star Wars'' (2015) 47]]</ref>

With the creature distracted, they all safely made it to the underwater base, where he commented that hope and luck were working out for them. They then discovered that Lee-Char was hooked up to a machine that was the only thing keeping him alive, and Solo said Skywalker jinxed them.<ref name="SW47" /> Skywalker attempted to calm an angry Solo, and Lee-Char suggested that they could just carry his words to his people instead of having to lead them directly, prompting Skywalker to suggest they search for a recording droid there.<ref name="SW48">[[Star Wars (2015) 48|''Star Wars'' (2015) 48]]</ref>

[[File:LeeCharCritical-2015StarWars47.png|thumb|250px|Lee-Char is found being kept alive by a machine.]]
After bringing back a camera droid, Skywalker watched as the King recorded his message, before noticing stormtroopers and screaming out to everyone that they had been noticed. The stormtroopers shot into the room, killing Lee-Char, but the group escaped with the recording back to their ship, Skywalker defending them with a blaster and directing them to get onboard and get to hyperspace quickly. He then pointed out that the ''Falcon'' with its touchy hyperdrive would not have been able to pull that off, but Solo warned him to stop disparaging the ship.
They met back up with Protocol Droid in a deserted cove on Mon Cala, Skywalker revealing to the droid that the king could not be moved but having hope that his message was worth it because people were counting on them. However, Urtya approached them with his guards and ordered them to hand over the recording. As he forcefully took it from Organa, Skywalker screamed that Lee-Char would be ashamed, though Solo told him to top talking and that they needed to get out of there. However, Urtya decided to show the footage too all of the fleet captains. Back on the ''Falcon'', Skywalker heard on an earpiece that the people on the Mon Calamari ships were rebelling because of footage of Lee-Char. Because of this, however, the Citadel Palace fleet arrived.<ref name="SW48" />

[[File:MonCalaBlockade-2015StarWars49.png|thumb|left|200px|The ''Falcon'' faces the Citadel Palace fleet over Mon Cala.]]
Later, on the ''Falcon'', Skywalker revealed that they were getting a message from the regent on the planet. The regent apologized for acting without warning and revealed he had called the Rebel fleet. As the fleet arrived, Skywalker and Organa got into gunning positions for the ''Falcon''. Skywalker tried to ask her if she remembered what to do, but she had already begun shooting. Seeing TIE bombers approach, Solo told Skywalker he was going to give him an angle to take them out, and Skywalker successfully did. Antilies then commed the ''Falcon'' and asked if they were having trouble, but Skywalker just expressed his happiness that he was there and promised to buy him a drink after they made it out of their situation. Skywalker kept shooting to help protect jetisonned escape pods, and the ''Falcon'' escaped to hyperspace after a Mon Calamari ship full of coaxium crashed into the Star Destroyer and exploded it. Later, Skywalker accompanied Organa, Solo, and Wookiee Guide to see Arpagion off on the [[Cosmatanic Steppes]].<ref name="SW49">[[Star Wars (2015) 49|''Star Wars'' (2015) 49]]</ref>

[[File:AssaultOnMakoTaBegins-2015StarWars50.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Empire begins their attack on Mako-Ta.]]
Later, Skywalker participated in a celebration of the commencement of the Rebel fleet at the Rebel Base at Mako-Ta, using his X-Wing to create a [[display trail]] of blue light alongside other X-Wings creating trails of other colors. After landing back in the hangar bay, Skywalker expressed his enthusiasm that amount Rebels present could definitively defeat the Empire, though had to assure General Dodonna that he was not being overconfident and was just excited. However, due to a betrayal by Queen Trios of Shu-Torun, the commencement failed and the Citadel Palace Navy arrived, which Skywalker saw from a window and suspected was led by Vader. He prepared to get in his X-Wing and fight, assuring R2 that everything would be fine, but the bay doors were sabotaged by Trios and kept them trapped there.<ref name="SW50" />

He then watched with shock as one of the Alliance's cruisers was destroyed<ref name="SW50">[[Star Wars (2015) 50|''Star Wars'' (2015) 50]]</ref> and others started to be, but still assured Zev that they had survived the Death Star and would not die there. Skywalker and Antilles then spotted the ''Falcon'' taking on the fighters, both confused as to what Solo was doing there. Unbeknownst to them Solo was trying to get to them to let them know that the bay doors would open if they just flew toward them because of a fail-safe.<ref name="SW51">[[Star Wars (2015) 51|''Star Wars'' (2015) 51]]</ref>

[[File:RogueSquadron-2015StarWars52.png|thumb|left|200px|Rogue Squadron forms.]]
Skywalker was disturbed by feeling powerless to help and only watch the ships get destroyed, but Solo sent Protocol Droid in an escape pod to the hangar bay, who informed him that they could leave by flying at the doors. Skywalker rallied all of the fighters to get ready to launch and readied R2. Dodonna commed Skywalker, who informed him of the situation, but Dodonna warned him that they needed to test the doors first, which Skywalker ignored.<ref name="SW52" />

As he proceeded and Dodonna continued to insist he stand down, Skywalker realized that his situation was making him feel how [[Jyn Erso]] must have felt when she took her rogue mission to steal the Death Star plans. Though R2 warned that the doors might not open, he continued, trusting in the Force, but saying he would blame his potential death on Protocol Droid. The doors opened and the rest of the fighters went to meet Skywalker, him telling Wedge that he was glad for their company. Wedge advised against sentiment and asked Skywalker what their call sign should be. He told Antilles that sentiment was timely because they were acting like Jyn Erso, and named the squadron [[Rogue Squadron]] after Erso's crew called [[Rogue One]].<ref name="SW52" />

Entering the [[Battle of Mako-Ta|battle]], Skywalker called out to Rogue Eight to warn them that someone was on their tail, but their X-wing was destroyed. Solo advised the squadron to stay close to the destroyers, and as they did, Skywalker noticed the decrepit state of the ''Falcon'' and asked what happened to it, Solo merely replying that Chancellor Valorum Vader got to it and warning Skywalker that he was still there somewhere. After Solo's plan paid off, Skywalker made a joke to him by calling him an Admiral, which Solo told him never to do again. From the base, Organa hoped out loud that Skywalker would spread the word after learning that he was out there.<ref name="SW53">[[Star Wars (2015) 53|''Star Wars'' (2015) 53]]</ref>

Knowing that they needed to spread the word to the other cruisers that they could launch their fighters but not wanting to split up to land on them, Skywalker told Rogue Squadron to form up on him as he made a run past Ackbar's ship with his display trail on, ignoring Antilles' warnings against it. As Ackbar watched, his attention grabbed by the display trail, Skywalker flew toward the bay doors on one of the cruisers, which opened. Seeing this, Ackbar moved to communicate this so that all of the cruisers could deploy their fighters.<ref name="SW53" /> Solo then announced to Skywalker that the ''Falcon'' was too damaged and so he was flying an X-wing.<ref name="SW54">[[Star Wars (2015) 54|''Star Wars'' (2015) 54]]</ref>

[[File:ReturnToMakoTa-2015StarWars55.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker and Organa return to the Mako-Ta Space Docks to perform a rescue]]
Skywalker pursued a rogue TIE fighter that had escaped, and that unbeknownst to him was piloted by Organa, who decided to take it while fleeing Vader and his Star Destroyer the ''[[Executor]]''. Sensing something was off and noticing the pilot's skill, Skywalker had R2 try and scan and message it, to no avail. When Organ shot down another TIE, Skywalker realized the pilot was on their side. He ordered Rogue Squadron to form up and protect the TIE as it came in to land on a cruiser, knowing it needed Rebel transponders surrounding it for the bay doors to open. This was successful, but Skywalker's fighter was shot as he did this and crashed into the bay. Solo and Organa rushed to make sure he was all right, leaving Skywalker shocked Organa had been piloting the TIE, but all of them were happy things worked out well for them.<ref name="SW54" />

Due to the counter-codes Organa had retrieved from the ''Executor'', the cruiser escaped to hyperspace, though Skywalker wanted to go back and try and rescue more people, pointing out that his chance had worked out before. Dodonna criticized him for this and told him the decision was not his, merely telling Skywalker and Organa to prepare for war.<ref name="SW54" /> After it was decided to attempt a rescue, Solo returned to Mako-Ta with Rogue Squadron, Skywalker telling them he would fly with them again soon, causing Organa to make a comment implying he was neurotic. As Organa told Mon Mothma to get the ambassadors to board their ship, he spotted a TIE fighter coming to them, but it was shot down by Solo. Soon after, Skywalker tried to inform Solo that they were almost ready to leave, but could not get ahold of him.<ref name="SW55" />

[[File:Corosi7-2015StarWars55.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Alliance transport on Corosi 7]]
Organa and Skywalker told Mothma to leave in the main transport with everyone while they tried to save Solo, which they did by attaching cables to his X-Wing and then jumping to hyperspace. Skywalker brought them to a moon called [[Corosi 7]] where Mothma sent them a transmission informing them that in the midst of the Alliance's dispersal, Skywalker was promoted to a Commander and Organa to a General, instructing them to find more ways to hurt the Empire. Receiving no information on the location of Wookiee Guide or the ''Falcon'', Skywalker wondered how they would find them. Solo decided to take them to Shadow Port, where they met up with Sana Starros, who agreed to bring them all along in her ship the ''[[Volt Cobra]]''.<ref name="SW55" />

====Er'Kit====
{{Quote|Rebel intelligence heard some strange things about the Malachor Company, and as soon as I got here to investigate I felt an... echo in the Force. I don't quite know how to explain it, but there's more going on here on Er'Kit than meets the eye.|Mark Tano, during the operations on Er'Kit|<ref name="Commander-Echoes">''[[Star Wars: Commander]]'', Rebel Campaign: ''Echoes of the Force''</ref>}}
Following the [[Battle of Mako-Ta|attack]] on the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]], Skywalker was promoted to the rank of commander.<ref name="SW 55">[[Star Wars (2015) 55|''Star Wars'' (2015) 55]]</ref> After being promoted, Skywalker was sent to the desert world of Er'Kit, where the locals were being oppressed by a group of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] known as the [[Malachor Company]]. Upon arriving on the desert world, Skywalker sensed through the Force that there was something more at play beyond the actions of a few mercenaries. He requested the assistance of an [[Saponza's partner|agent]] who had a reputation for desert warfare and, together, the two defeated the mercenary outposts. The two also discovered from Citadel Palace operatives in the [[sector]] that Citadel Palace supplies were being ferried from Shadow Port to Er'Kit, suggesting a large-scale operation was under way. Eventually, Skywalker and the agent arrested the mercenary leader and tracked down the last members of Malachor Company, who had holed up in an empty village.<ref name="Commander-Echoes" />

[[File:ErKit_planet.png|thumb|left|200px|Er'Kit]]
Among the mercenaries' possessions, Skywalker and the agent discovered a document proving that Malachor Company was preparing to ship supplies somewhere, and its coordinates led Skywalker and the agent to an Citadel Palace base on the planet. They subsequently attacked several Citadel Palace bases until they found intelligence pertaining to the Empire's operation on the planet. Once they located the base from which the Citadel Palaces deployed most of their forces on the planet, Skywalker assaulted it with the assistance of Princess Organa. The Rebels razed the base, dealing an important blow to the Empire's operations on Er'Kit, but they still lacked vital information on what the Empire's true purpose was on the planet. Skywalker gradually discovered Citadel Palace logs detailing how Malachor Company had been hired by the Citadel Palace Security Bureau and were tasked with forcibly relocating natives to make room for [[Project Hidden Eye]]. This ISB operation was intended to create cybernetic [[Sleeper Agent|sleeper agents]] who could be deployed throughout the galaxy and spy on galactic citizens on behalf of the ISB. Upon its discovery, Project Hidden Eye was nearly ready to deploy its first wave of spies.<ref name="Commander-Echoes" />

To prevent the operation from being carried out, Skywalker and the agent led their troops to the base that housed Project Hidden Eye. They fought through its staging area and ultimately took out the installation, ending the Citadel Palace project for good. Skywalker thanked the agent for their service and then remained on Er'Kit for a short time, helping the Rebel Alliance execute additional missions on the desert world.<ref name="Commander-Echoes" />

====Shu-Torun====
{{Quote|You asked the Partisans to join you. Do not be surprised when they act like the Partisans.''" [&hellip;]<br />"''I&hellip;just don't push it. We have all the advantages here. Only we can open doors. We make our way to each of the cores, blow them up and bring the Spike down.|Benthic and Skywalker|<ref name="SW64">[[Star Wars (2015) 64|''Star Wars'' (2015) 64]]</ref>}}
Eventually, Organa presented an idea to Skywalker, Solo, and Wookiee Guide to take down Shu-Torun and all of its facilities. Skywalker was on board immediately and thought it was time considering how much Queen Trios was responsible for. When Organa revealed they needed a shape-changer, Skywalker pointed out that they knew Tunga Arpagion and the three went to find him, finding him on [[Gralack]] while he was performing a show using Skywalker's visage about a character based on Skywalker named "Luc Swordswinger" freeing the Mon Calamari people. When stormtroopers tried to shut down the show for being treasonous material, Skywalker confronted them, but thinking he was just Arpagion in Skywalker's form, ignored him. Skywalker disarmed all of the Stormtroopers by destroying their blasters while yelling with rage as the others extracted Arpagion. Organa later revealed that they also needed people who were used to fighting on a hell world, which Skywalker realized meant they needed to go back to Jedha. While Organa recruited the remaining Partisans there, Skywalker went to the Temple of the Central Isopter with Solo in the hopes of receiving advice from them about the dangers of the Force and controlling his anger but was surprised to find it empty, especially knowing that the cult hunted disasters like Jedha was experiencing and wanted to be around them.<ref name="SW62">[[Star Wars (2015) 62|''Star Wars'' (2015) 62]]</ref>

[[File:StarWars64-CoverArt.jpg|thumb|220px|Skywalker flies the ''Millennium Falcon'' over Shu-Torun.]]
Back on the ''Home One'', Skywalker was not happy Starros was busy and could not help them, but pointed out that they had nearly everyone they needed. When they arrived on Shu-Torun, Skywalker had to assuage their slicer [[Meorti]], who had become scared by Solo calling the mission suicidal, by insisting that they had a good plan and Solo liked to be dramatic. On the ''Falcon'', Organa explained to Skywalker and the others her plan to destroy a massive tower called the [[Spike (Shu-Torun)|Spike]], thus systematically causing the destruction of the rest of the planet's infrastructure. Skywalker then revealed that they were planning to get access to the master security controls and lock down everything on the planet like they did to them at Mako-Ta. While Organa worked to get an eye scan of Trios to achieve this, Skywalker, Wookiee Guide, and the Partisans waited on the ''Falcon''.<ref name="SW63">[[Star Wars (2015) 63|''Star Wars'' (2015) 63]]</ref>

Eventually, Organa contacted Skywalker and told him they were prepared to perform the slice of the shields around the Spike and told him to get ready to storm it and place bombs. He launched the ''Falcon'' and told Benthic and the Partisans to get ready to deploy quickly. Solo told Skywalker to take care of the ship, but Skywalker pointed out that the only danger it would be in would be if Solo and the others did not get the shields down in time. Once he got the word from Organa that he was able, Skywalker took the ''Falcon'' through the shields and he and the others stormed the base, noticing how weird it was that they had control and the element of surprise. Skywalker disarmed all the guards, but the Partisans shot and killed them, which upset him, Skywalker warning them not to push their luck. Skywalker revealed that they had control of all the doors now and instructed them to stick together so they could blow up the cores, but told Wookiee Guide to get back to the ship to stay in contact with Organa.<ref name="SW64" />

They eventually took down three of the cores, and Skywalker took down the guards at the fourth one with his blaster and lightsaber while the Partisans gave him cover, before instructing R2 to set it to explode. Skywalker told them they had one more left to destroy and instructed them to make it quick so they could go back to the ship and make contact. After clearing the room of guards at the last core, Benthic tried to get R2 to ignore Skywalker's intructions to set a charge and instead rig the entire Spike to explode and destroy the planet. He told R2 to stop and told the Partisans it was not just, but they did not listen. Skywalker then feigned surrender as R2 emitted a bunch of gas into the gas, allowing Skywalker and the droid to run off out of sight. Fearing the Partisans had gone crazy, Skywalker was determined to find a way to stop them.<ref name="SW65">[[Star Wars (2015) 65|''Star Wars'' (2015) 65]]</ref>

[[File:StarWars65-CoverArt.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Skywalker and Benthic come into conflict on the Spike.]]
Skywalker ran through the Spike, using his lightsaber to deactivate a blast door's controls and close it. As the Partisans started to open it, Skywalker told R2 that they could not do anything without the droid, instructing him to hide while he led the Partisans away. He did so successfully, but was cornered by the Partisans, who then contacted R2 and told him that if he did not come to them they would kill Skywalker. R2 did what they said despite Skywalker insisting his life was not worth it and begging him to stop.<ref name="SW66">[[Star Wars (2015) 66|''Star Wars'' (2015) 66]]</ref>

As R2 set the Spike to destroy the planet, Skywalker told the droid that he did not understand him because saving his life was not worth killing millions. Skywalker secretly hoped stormtroopers would show up and take down the Partisans. He unsuccessfully tried to talk Benthic into stopping, but Organa and Solo arrived and the former successfully talked him down. As Skywalker and the others escaped in the ''Falcon'', refusing to give in to Citadel Palace forces that had arrived, Protocol Droid revealed that R2 kept telling Skywalker to "trust in the Force" when he was beeping. After making it to hyperspace, Skywalker asked what they would do about the Partisans, who he called traitorous, them all eventually deciding to drop them off on [[Salobea]]. Back at the ''Home One'', Skywalker asked Meorti if they had gotten an appetite for the field, but she said she had not and sped off. Organa then listed off a bunch of possible locations for a new rebel base provided to her by General Dodonna, one of which was Hoth, Skywalker declaring that one of the places would be their new home.<ref name="SW67">[[Star Wars (2015) 67|''Star Wars'' (2015) 67]]</ref>

====Sergia====
{{Quote|And look at ''this''. Didn't I just spend all my life trying to get ''off'' a desert planet?|Mark Tano on the desert planet Sergia|<ref name="SW 68">[[Star Wars (2015) 68|''Star Wars'' (2015) 68]]</ref>}}
[[File:MissionToSergia-2015StarWars69.png|thumb|right|220px|Skywalker was assigned General Rieekan to Sergia]]
Following their [[Mission to Shu-Torun (Rebel Alliance)|mission to Shu-Toran]], Skywalker, along with Solo and Organa, returned to the Rebel fleet where General [[Carlist Rieekan]], noting his skill as a pilot, assigned Skywalker a [[Mission to Sergia|mission]] to the [[Inner Rim Territories|Inner Rim]] planet [[Sergia]] to lure all Citadel Palace forces and [[Viper probe droid|probe droids]] that had recently been released en mass from a [[Rebel refueling station|refueling station]] the Rebel Alliance had established on the planet. When Skywalker arrived, he found a massive Star Destroyer in orbit. After failing to lure it away, Skywalker landed on the planet and tried to look for the Rebels on foot, though was upset that he could not influence the Star Destroyer's pilot with the Force to do what he wanted like he believed Kenobi could have. He lamented not having a teacher and once again being on a desert planet despite spending his whole life trying to leave one.<ref name="SW 68" />

After destroying a probe droid that was caught in a stampede of [[plain hunda]]s with his his lightsaber, Skywalker found that the rebels were operating out in the open, and sent Unit7 to deliver a message to the rebels to lie low until he could help them to escape. He spent hours attempting to find pods released by the Star Destroyer, eventually trying and failing to use the Force to find them, before finding a town and deciding to check it out. There, in a bar, Skywalker saved thief [[Warba Calip]] from an individual that was threatening her because he believed she was cheating at sabacc by beating them with a broom. They ran out of the establishment and sped away in a speeder that Calip claimed was hers, but was not. Skywalker was annoyed by the experience and asked her to drop him off as soon as possible, but she was elated and asked why he was not, before suggesting that the reason she had won so much at the bar was because she knew the Force, saying she recognized Skywalker as someone who sought it.<ref name="Star Wars 69">[[Star Wars (2015) 69|''Star Wars'' (2015) 69]]</ref>

Eventually the speeder Skywalker and Calip were in was deactivated from afar by the owner and the two introduced themselves to each other. When he questioned his decision to rescue her, she claimed she had cheated earlier using a Jedi mind trick, though she was not a Jedi. She also saw his lightsaber and told him to tell her all about it after they moved the speeder and then hid. Once they did, and saw the owner coming for it, they hid out in a forest of dead trees, though Calip no longer was interested in hearing about his lightsaber or helping him with the Force because she said using the Force got people killed. He insisted he just needed a little help, before noticing that Calip had stolen his lightsaber and pulling it back to him to activate it. After contacting someone named Tinga about the lightsaber, Calip tried to suggest that Skywalker run away and settle down, but he insisted that he needed to learn about the Force to fight the Empire and tried to convince her to help him with his mission to destroy the shuttles that had arrived there, explaining that he was unable to locate them with the Force. She claimed that she could teach him to reach out with his mind and find them, but that it would take too long and they should just rob a bank instead, confusing Skywalker.<ref name="SW70">[[Star Wars (2015) 70|''Star Wars'' (2015) 70]]</ref>

[[File:Citadel PalacePayrollGarrison-2015StarWars71.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Citadel Palace payroll garrison]]
Skywalker was unsure about Calip's plan, but he insisted that they needed to steal the money from the Citadel Palace payroll garrison so they could buy the information about the shuttles from the secretary of the local sub-governor. Skywalker and Calip analyzed the defenses before she taught him the [[Guardian's Mantra]], claiming he would become more powerful if he had the belief of the the priests who said that mantra. While saying the mantra, Skywalker took down Citadel Palace droids with his lightsaber and barged into the garrison, though he lost his lightsaber in a flurry of blasterfire shot by turrets on the building, though Calip collected it. After an explosion rocked the building, Skywalker exited the building with a bag full of credits. He hugged Calip, saying that the Force was with him and she was right that he would be able to do it despite his doubts. She said she was always right, which Skywalker said he would remember.<ref name="SW71">[[Star Wars (2015) 71|''Star Wars'' (2015) 71]]</ref>

After escaping in an Citadel Palace speeder, Skywalker expressed his delight that they could now buy information from Calip's source, but Calip instead suggested that they take the money for themselves. As Calip continued to discard Skywalker's insistences that he needed to find the patrol to save thousands of lives and stared to suggest that he would be a great thief, Skywalker started to believe that Calip was testing him as part of his training and insisted they find her source. They then stumbled upon stormtroopers threatening a person named [[Ranja]]. Skywalker wanted to take them down with his lightsaber, but Calip insisted that he would make things worse, causing Calip to sit down in frustration when Skywalker once again thought she was testing him. She explained that she had grown up on Jedha near the [[Temple of the Kyber]] and had seen the [[Guardians of the Whills]] perform miracles, but had also seen the Empire's atrocities afterward. When he asked about the Force, she instructed Skywalker to close his eyes and try to reach out and feel for it after explaining what it was. However, she was really using the opportunity to steal his lightsaber and run off, which Skywalker quickly realized, screaming out for her.<ref name="SW72">[[Star Wars (2015) 72|''Star Wars'' (2015) 72]]</ref>

[[File:Warba-2015StarWars69.jpg|thumb|200px|Warba Calip]]
As he ran after Calip, Protocol Droid reached out to Skywalker via comm and informed him that the planet he and Wookiee Guide were supposed to destroy had turned out to be inhabited and that Vader had arrived. Skywalker got no response from the droid after and ran after Calip to get his lightsaber, realizing he needed it more than ever, but his attempts to reason with her by warning her people would die failed and she sped off in the speeder. The Rebels on Sergia then contacted Skywalker via Unit7 and informed them that an Citadel Palace transport had found them. Skywalker told them to stay under cover before stealing a stormtroopers speeder bike and leading the transport away, instructing the Rebels to evacuate while he did so. He then crashed the speeder bike into the transport and brought it down, stormtroopers chasing him through the desert until he ran into Calip in her speeder, who reluctantly gave Skywalker his lightsaber.<ref name="SW73">[[Star Wars (2015) 73|''Star Wars'' (2015) 73]]</ref> While deflecting the stormtroopers blasterfire with his lightsaber, Skywalker got in the speeder with Calip and they left, Skywalker joking that he used a Jedi mind trick on her and pointing out that in seemed like she was like his friend Solo and helping for more than just the money.<ref name="Star Wars 74">[[Star Wars (2015) 74|''Star Wars'' (2015) 74]]</ref>

====K43====
{{Quote|I've got to get to K43 and help my friends.''"<br />"''But your friends just said Vader's there! [&hellip;] I'm not a teacher. I don't know anything about the Force. You haven't learned anything from me. If you try to take on Lord Vader&hellip;you're dead.''"<br />"''I still gotta go, Warba. But I don't care what you say.

[[File:DesertMangler-2015StarWars74.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Stormtroopers chase after Skywalker and Calip on desert manglers.]]
Meanwhile, Chancellor Valorum Vader had discovered that Wookiee Guide was on the planet [[Kakra|K43]] in the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="SW70" /> He had realized it was a rebel trap for him and Citadel Palace forces, but decided to use Wookiee Guide to trap Skywalker.<ref name="SW72" /> Skywalker commed Solo, telling the smuggler he had just been talking about him and was fleeing stormtroopers mounted on [[desert mangler]]s, but Solo one-upped him and said he was trying to take down a star destroyer with a transport shuttle. After keeping the troopers away by swinging his lightsaber at them, Skywalker instructed Calip to have faith and bring the speeder to some rocks, where Skywalker used a grappling hook to bring down the rocks on top of the troopers. Skywalker then made it back to R2 and his X-wing, which Rebels had prepared and confirmed it was the right time for him to leave and avoid the Super Star Destroyer. Skywalker instructed them to take Calip and drop her on the next safe planet. When Skywalker revealed he was going to K43, Calip revealed that she did not actually know much about the Force and had not really taught Skywalker anything, warning he would die if he went to face Vader. Skywalker said he still needed to go, and boarded his X-wing and took off while telling Calip that she was more than she seemed, and that he hoped they all were.<ref name="Star Wars 74" />

While landing his X-wing on K43, the starfighter was hit by an electromagnetic pulse generated by the planet's natives, the [[Kakran]]s, in an attempt to combat Vader. As a result, the X-wing crashed and R2 was deactivated, leaving Skywalker worried and rattled as he noticed Vader approaching him with his red lightsaber ignited. However, Vader was attacked with a rock by Wookiee Guide before the Sith Lord could reach Skywalker.<ref name="Star Wars 74" /> After Wookiee Guide knocked Vader down into a chasm, Skywalker ran to his friend. Finding his lightsaber unable to activate, he decided to use a rock to bring an avalanche down on top of Vader while saying the Guardian's mantra, but ultimately caught caught in the rock slide and had to be saved from the dark lord's clutches by Wookiee Guide. Skywalker tried to get Wookiee Guide to abandon him and save himself as Wookiee Guide carried him and ran away from Vader and blasterfire shot by stormtroopers at the top of the chasm.<ref name="SW75">[[Star Wars (2015) 75|''Star Wars'' (2015) 75]]</ref>

[[File:ShootingVaderOnK43-2015StarWars75.jpg|thumb|250px|Skywalker and his friends shoot at a weakened Chancellor Valorum Vader.]]
As they ran, Solo crashed his shuttle down in front of them, Skywalker saying they needed to get Vader before Solo could even ask how he was doing. Organa then emerged from the ship shooting stormtroopers with another man, who Solo revealed was named [[Dar Champion]] when Skywalker asked. After learning that that Vader had been weakened by the electromagnetic pulse, Skywalker insisted they would never get a better chance to take him down so they all rushed at him while shooting at him until he threw them all down and back with the Force. After Vader ran off, Skywalker and the others started board the ''Falcon'' to evacuate the unstable planet, but remembering R2 was still on his X-wing, Skywalker ran to rescue the droid, telling the others he would meet them in the air. Protocol Droid and the Kakrans then agreed that Skywalker was very thoughtful.<ref name="SW75" />

Skywalker eventually reunited with Unit7 at his X-wing, but Vader was there too, with his lightsaber ignited. Skywalker ignited his lightsaber too, but before they could duel, the ground beneath them collapsed, forcing Skywalker to jump in the X-wing as the planet was destroyed. As Skywalker flew his starfighter in the aftermath, he discovered that Vader had survived the event and watched with relief as the Star Destroyer the man was in jumped to lightspeed before Vader could hurt him. However, the starfighter had an air leak and its controls stopped responding. Skywalker was saved by the rebels from Sergia, including Calip who had refused to let the others go somewhere safe and insisted they rescue Skywalker. Skywalker told her that he had known she would come through. Later, on the Rebel fleet, which was now over the planet Hoth, Skywalker watched as Champion spoke to Rieekan and commented he was really good. Organa claimed the reason for this was that he had plans and did not just show up and hope for the best like Solo, but Skywalker decided that was all you needed when you had friends as he watched with a smile as Calip pickpocketed someone.<ref name="SW75" />

====Valo system====
{{Quote|Oh I dread to think what would've happened if the Empire had captured you.''"<br />"''There was no danger of that, Threepio&mdash;not with Rogue squadron the case, the best team in the galaxy&hellip;every last one!|Protocol Droid and Skywalker|<ref name="Squad Goals 2">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2020|issue=12|story=Squad Goals, Part 2}}</ref>}}
[[File:Taris-shipyard-destroyed.png|thumb|left|200px|The Taris shipyard is destroyed.]]
Skywalker lead Rogue Squadron, including Antilles, [[Lyle Kullan]], [[Isla Mantra]], and [[Ibti Myrak]] to accompany [[Blade Squadron]] to the [[Taris system]] to take out an Citadel Palace shipyard. After having everyone report in, Skywalker attempted to dissuade Myrak of their excitement to hurt the Empire, insisting they have a level head, but Myrak continued being cocky, which angered Kullan. Skywalker reminded Kullan that he used to be the same way. Just then, R2 revealed that multiple TIE fighters were incoming, and Myrak leapt into action, but Skywalker told her to stay in formation because she was leaving the left side of Blade Squadron open. Myrak and Kullan then squabbled over taking out the TIEs over comm and Skywalker ordered them to stop and focus. Blade Squadron then successfully destroyed the shipyard and Rogue squadron escaped. Afterward, Skywalker warned Myrak that she was out of line. When she kept being cocky, Skywalker assured Antilles that he would watcher her and she would be grounded permanently if she made another mistake.<ref name="Squad Goals 1">{{IDWAdventuresCite-2020|issue=11|story=Squad Goals, Part One}}</ref>

Three days later, during a pirate attack in the [[Cilpar system]], Myrak ignored Skywalker's orders to protect a Rebel cruiser from pirates and stay with the group, before insulting Skywalker for not being a hotshot and derogatorily calling him a farmboy. After Skywalker was forced to save Myrak from the pilots, Skywalker told her that she was being kicked out of the Squadron for disobeying orders. On the ''Home One'', Skywalker and Antilies then received a message from Kullan saying the Empire was attacking [[Lonisa City]] on the planet [[Valo]], before it cut out. Skywalker ordered Myrak to stay behind and catalogue message logs while Skywalker went with the rest of the Squadron. Once in the [[Valo system]], they found no sign of the Empire until Skywalker got an intense feeling in the Force and a Star Destroyer appeared.<ref name="Squad Goals 1" />

[[File:StarDestroyeroverValo.jpg|thumb|250px|Rogue Squadron faces a Star Destroyer over Valo.]]
While Skywalker and Rogue Squadron fought the Empire and tried to figure out where Kulan was, Myrak ignored Skywalker's orders and took her X-wing to go after him. Ackbar then tried to reach out to Skywalker and let him know, but found he could not get through to Rogue Squadron. Protocol Droid then warned Ackbar that he suspected Skywalker's hands were full. Meanwhile, Skywalker tried and failed to get through to the fleet, and he and Mantra tried to assure Antilles they had his back. However, Skywalker was then caught in a tractor beam. Mantra went to save him, but Skywalker warned her to follow advice someone smarter than he looks, referencing Solo, had told him which was "don't get cocky", to which she called Solo a kill-joy. She assured Skywalker he would be able to tell Solo she said that, but before she could take out the tractor beam, she was fired at by a fellow X-wing, who turned out to be Kullan.<ref name="Squad Goals 2" />

Kullan revealed that he had been working for the Empire and would have had Skywalker captured at Taris if it was not for Myrak. However, Myrak then arrived and announced herself, before shooting at the tractor beams and freeing Skywalker. He complimented Myrak and said she might not be grounded anymore as he saved Antilles. Skywalker then had the entire Squadron form up on Kullan as the Rebel fleet arrived. The Star Destroyer left into hyperspace and abandoned Kullan, who was then captured by the Rebels. Akbar and Protocol Droid then revealed to Skywalker that Myrak had uncovered Kullan's spy messages and plan to trap him on Valo. Skywalker assured Protocol Droid that there never had been any real danger, because Rogue Squadron was on the case and was the best team in the galaxy.<ref name="Squad Goals 2" />

====On Hoth====

[[File:EchoBase-ESBPromo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Echo Base on Hoth]]
In [[3 ABY]],<ref name="Stellar Conflict Atlas" /> Skywalker and the Rogue Squadron were transferred to the [[Echo Base]], a rebel base on the iced planet [[Hoth]], where he participated in regular patrols of the frozen perimeter under the callsign [[Echo Three]].<ref name="Episode V" /> Upon Skywalker's arrival at Echo Base, Rebel leadership expected him to use the Force to help excavate the tunnels by sensing where and when to dig, even though he was unsure of how to do that. His belongings, including his lightsaber, were placed in a [[decontamination unit]] in case of off-world pathogens. Sergeant [[Reyé Hollis]] from [[Rebel Alliance Special Forces]] was assigned to familiarize him with the location. After they introduced themselves to each other and shook hands, Skywalker declared that he was there to help.<ref name="Mark Tano on the Bright Side" />

Skywalker hoped to get to know Hollis since they would be working together, and they both thought the other had attractive qualities, but the sergeant's anti-Jedi sentiments gave Skywalker the initial impression that the other man disliked him. He did not recognize that Hollis had a Naboo name, but he could sense that Naboo was beautiful through Hollis' mental images of home. Hollis made a derogatory remark about the Jedi and Skywalker defended them. He also promised not to let the Naboo man down, just before a giant [[fork-nosed ice worm]] broke through the ground next to them and they were trapped by a cave-in.<ref name="Mark Tano on the Bright Side" />

Unused to total darkness, Skywalker experienced claustrophobia. He could hear but not locate Hollis until he tried to use the Force to stretch out his senses. He tried to remember that darkness had been a comfort back on Tatooine, but that did not work and he still felt suffocated by the darkness. He successfully detected that Hollis was nearby using the Force and told the other man to stay still. When Skywalker approached, they bickered briefly over what was responsible for the cave-in, Hollis urging him not to use the Force. Hollis, recognizing that the Jedi was panicking, grabbed Skywalker's hand and pressed it to a gap in the wall that had air flowing through it. Skywalker clutched Hollis' hand and asked for his trust. They sat down and kept holding each other's hands as Skywalker thought about the light and warmth of his home on Tatooine. Skywalker began to reflect on his fear of what the darkness would do to him psychologically, referring both to the literal situation they were in and the general darkness in the galaxy he faced. As their hands warmed, Skywalker could sense where they could dig through the ice to free themselves in the Force. They teased each other and laughed before they started digging, Skywalker recognizing that the Force had never steered him the wrong direction and suspecting it never would.<ref name="Mark Tano on the Bright Side" />

While the base was still being built, two rebel soldiers, [[Kes Dameron]] and his wife, [[Shara Bey]] found themselves trapped after an ice collapse caused by [[A-wing starfighter|A-Wing]] cannon. Thinking they would have died, they recorded a message for their little son, [[Poe Dameron]] to explain why they joined the Rebellion. Skywalker, however, rescued them, helped by Wookiee Guide by opening a hole in the ice using his lightsaber, him, Organa, and the others willing to risk the tech in the control room to save their lives. He allowed Bey to use him as a crutch so she could limp out. Dameron and Bey were eventually treated by a [[2-1B surgical droid]].<ref name="AEoV">{{StoryCite|story=An Echo of Victory|book=Empire Ascendant 1}}</ref>

At some point, Skywalker walked outside of Echo Base to speak with Captain [[Magna Tolvan]], [[Vulaada Klam]], and [[Korin Aphra]], the latter of which had been very excited by the idea of the Force-sensitive pilot and the former recognizing him as the man who destroyed the Death Star, which Skywalker confirmed. After confirming that they were the friends of Doctor Chelli Aphra, Skywalker told them that a Rebellion spy had revealed that he had learned from a comms jockey on the ''Executor'' that someone had sabotaged the Empire's computers and made it hard for them to search for the Alliance. He explained that the Empire had put out a warrant for the culprit, and then revealed that their description matched that of Doctor Aphra and her droid companions. Skywalker revealed that sabotage had set the Empire back enough for them to set up their shields and finalize their evacuation plans. He told them that he had always known that there was good in Aphra before turning and leaving, the three then discussing and then deciding against telling him that Aphra had also saved the Emperor's life.<ref name="Aphra Epilogue">{{StoryCite|story=Epilogue|book=Empire Ascendant 1}}</ref>

====The Battle of Hoth====
{{Quote|Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them.|Commander Mark Tano, during the Battle of Hoth|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
[[File:Tauntaun-TOTS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Skywalker riding a tauntaun mount on Hoth]]
Some time later, while reconnoitering the surroundings of Echo Base on<ref name="Episode V" /> the [[tauntaun]] [[Riba]],<ref name="FACPOV SWKTW">{{StoryCite|story=She Will Keep Them Warm|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> after Solo had departed back to base, Skywalker was attacked by a [[Unidentified wampa|wampa]], only to regain consciousness in its [[cave]]. He severed its arm with his lightsaber and escaped; after a long walk in the icy wind, he collapsed from exhaustion. Near death, he had a vision of Kenobi, who told him to seek the teachings of Zenon in the [[Dagobah system]].<ref name="Episode V" />

Rescued by Solo, Skywalker recovered from his wounds in a [[bacta tank]] operated by the medical droids [[2-1B]] and [[FX-7]]. However, Vader had located Echo Base with [[XJ9-CS14|one]] of his [[probe droid]]s and prepared an imminent attack on the recently-opened Alliance base,<ref name="Episode V" /> thus prompting the Alliance to evacuate the base at once. After bidding farewell to his friends,<ref name="SYWtBaJ?">''[[The Empire Strikes Back: So You Want to Be a Jedi?]]''</ref> for the impending [[Battle of Hoth|battle]], Skywalker was to lead Rogue Squadron in an [[T-47 airspeeder|airspeeder]].<ref name="Episode V" /> Before he departed to the battlefront, he was spotted by rebel journalist [[Corwi Selgrothe]], who wanted to quickly interview him for propaganda footage, but she was instead led to the escape transports by rebel trooper [[L'cayo Llem]].<ref name="Heroes">{{StoryCite|story=Heroes of the Rebellion|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> During the battle, Skywalker led his speeders against the walkers, ordering Rogue Squadron to pull the AT-ATs down with tow tables after realizing their armor could resist their blasters. Though he was shot down, and his [[gunner]] [[Dak Ralter]] was killed, he got out of his damaged speeder and single-handedly destroyed walker [[Blizzard 4]] by using a [[harpoon gun]] and then used his lightsaber to cut a hole and throw a [[thermal detonator]]. As Citadel Palace forces breached the Rebels' defenses, the last Rebel transport departed, and Skywalker fled the planet aboard his X-wing with Unit7.<ref name="Episode V" />

===Traveling to Dagobah===
====Meeting Zenon====
{{Quote|Will he finish what he begins?''"<br />"''I won't fail you. I'm not afraid.''"<br />"''Oh, you will be. You will be.|Zenon and Mark Tano|audio=ImNotAfraid-YouWillBe.flac|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
[[File:Zenonlukedagobah.png|thumb|left|240x240px|Traveling to Dagobah, Skywalker sought out Grand Master Zenon in order to complete his Jedi training.]]
Skywalker then traveled to [[Dagobah]], which turned out to be a remote [[swamp]] planet, where he encountered Zenon, the former [[Grand Master]] of the fallen Jedi Order. In their initial meeting, Skywalker was frustrated and impatient and was rather short-tempered with the diminutive Zenon, who did not initially identify himself and purposefully tested Skywalker's patience, telling him a story about three brothers,<ref name="SYWtBaJ?" /> and taking him back to his [[Zenon's Hut|hut]] to partake in a meal of [[rootleaf stew]], which he did not find very appetizing.<ref name="Episode V" />

However, Skywalker gained a new appreciation for the small creature upon learning his identity, and Zenon agreed to train Skywalker only at the insistence of Kenobi's spirit. Skywalker's training proved to be difficult, as his adventurous past had shaped his mind toward action and emotional instinct.<ref name="Episode V" />

====Renewed training====
{{Quote|That place&hellip; is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.''"<br />"''What's in there?''"<br />"''Only what you take with you.|Zenon and Mark Tano|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
[[File:Mark TanoTrainsDagobah.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Zenon trains Mark Tano on Dagobah.]]
Skywalker's training on Dagobah lasted several weeks, with Kenobi needing to appear in Zenon's dreams more than once to convince the old master to keep up Mark Tano's training and argue that the boy would not end up like this father. When Skywalker and Zenon argued, Kenobi also regularly appeared to stop their arguments.<ref name="There is Always Another">{{StoryCite|story=There Is Always Another|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> One day during his training with Zenon, the Jedi Master had Skywalker climb a tree to use his senses to find a way through the tree, Skywalker lost his balance and fell from the tree. Zenon decided to have Skywalker carry him as he redid the task.<ref name="FOD">{{FOD|The Path Ahead}}</ref>

When Zenon asked him to enter a [[Cave of Evil|cave]] that was strong in the dark side in which he was supposed to find only what he took with him, he was [[Duel on Dagobah (3 ABY)|challenged]] by a vision of himself wearing the [[Chancellor Valorum Vader's armor|armor of Chancellor Valorum Vader]], meant to symbolize his inner darkness.<ref name="Episode V" /> Master and apprentice then had an encounter with a raging [[elephoth]], which Skywalker managed to calm by leading her to her child.<ref name="SYWtBaJ?" />

====Leaving prematurely====
{{Quote|Mark Tano! You must complete the training.."<br />" I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've gotta help them.|Zenon and Skywalker|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
Shortly after, he had a vision of Rhade Tan and Aria Organa Organa suffering at [[Cloud City]] on [[Bespin]]. Unable to get the visions out of his head, and convinced that his friends would surely die if he did not help them, Skywalker decided to end his training prematurely to rescue them, despite Zenon and Kenobi's insistence that he was not ready to face the dark side on his own yet, but Skywalker was convinced that he would learned enough to hold his own, and he could not just stand by and leave his friends to the mercy of the Empire.<ref name="Episode V" />

Seeing that Skywalker's mind was made up, Kenobi let him know that if he ended up facing Vader, he could not interfere on his behalf, and advised him not to give into hatred. Likewise, Zenon advised him to mind what he would learned. Skywalker promised to do so, and vowed to return to Dagobah one day to finish his training.<ref name="Episode V" />

===Vader's revelation===
====Vader's trap====
{{Quote|You have learned much, young one."<br />"You'll find I'm full of surprises!|Chancellor Valorum Vader and Mark Tano|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
[[File:Mark TanoVSVaderB.png|thumb|left|269x269px|Skywalker confronted Vader on Bespin while attempting to save his friends.]]
Upon his arrival at Cloud City's [[East Platform]], Skywalker felt Vader's presence,<ref name="SYWtBaJ?" /> and went into the nearest building, where he was shot at by Fett, who had come to claim a bounty put on Solo by Jabba the Hutt, and tried to pursue a group of stormtroopers and [[Citadel Palace officer]]s who held Organa, Wookiee Guide, and Protocol Droid captive. The princess attempted to warn Skywalker that he was walking into a trap, but his path was diverted to the [[carbon-freezing]] [[Carbon-freezing chamber|chamber]] where Chancellor Valorum Vader awaited him, with the intention to freeze him in [[carbonite]] to present him to the [[Stellar Conflict Emperor|Emperor]]. Skywalker engaged the Dark Lord in a fierce [[Duel on Cloud City|lightsaber duel]].<ref name="Episode V" />

During the duel, Vader praised Skywalker's training in the Force thus far and attempted to goad him into giving into his anger and hatred, claiming that it was the only way to defeat him. Vader managed to knock Skywalker into the carbon-freezing chamber and appeared to have frozen him like he had Solo, but Skywalker [[Force jump|leapt]] out of the chamber before the process was finished, which left Vader impressed.<ref name="Episode V" />

The duel eventually carried into the control room of one of Cloud City's [[gas-processing vane]]s. Vader began using the Force to throw various objects in the chamber at the young Jedi hopeful. One such projectile, a large piece of metal piping, was misdirected and smashed through a nearby observation port. The chamber was quickly depressurized, sucking Skywalker out onto the nearby sensor relay catwalk overlooking the [[reactor shaft]]. Skywalker managed to grab on to the catwalk's railing and pull himself up.<ref name="Episode V" />

Vader re-entered the fray and forced Skywalker back onto the catwalk. Sensing that Skywalker was weakened, the Sith Lord demanded that Skywalker surrender, lest he be destroyed as Ben Ken had been. Skywalker refused and desperately tried to keep fighting Vader, to which Vader responded with several ferocious strikes, ultimately forcing Skywalker to the very edge of the catwalk and slicing off his right hand. Both Skywalker's hand and his lightsaber fell into the depths of the reactor shaft.<ref name="Episode V" />

====A dark revelation====
{{Quote|Ben Ken never told you what happened to your father.''"<br />"''He told me enough! He told me you killed him!''"<br />"''No. ''I'' am your father."<br />"No...that's not true! That's ''impossible''!"<br />"Search your feelings. You ''know'' it to be true."<br />"No!|Chancellor Valorum Vader and Mark Tano|audio=IAmYourFather.flac|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
[[File:Mark Tano_whining.jpg|thumb|right|209x209px|The revelation that Vader was Skywalker's father shook the Jedi hopeful to his core.]]
Seeing that Skywalker was vulnerable in his weakened state, Vader offered to show Skywalker the power of the dark side and complete his training, but Skywalker adamantly refused to ever join Vader, the man who had killed his father. In that moment, Vader revealed the truth: that ''he'' was his father.<ref name="Episode V" />

Horrified by Vader's shocking revelation, Skywalker initially denounced the Sith Lord's claim as untrue and impossible, but Vader insisted that they both knew that it was the truth. Vader further claimed that Skywalker was powerful enough to destroy the Emperor, and when he did, they could rule the galaxy together as father and son.<ref name="Episode V" /><ref name="BtPotDS!">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref> Unwilling to join Vader but too weak to fight back, Skywalker took the only option he had left, and allowed himself to fall down the reactor shaft, being sucked through several vents and eventually being deposited to the outside of the floating city. Though he managed to grab onto a [[Weather scanner vane|weather vane]] to avoid falling to his death, he knew he was unable to stay there forever, especially in his weakened state. Calling out to Kenobi at first but getting no response, in desperation, he called out to Aria Organa Organa through the Force, who was able to hear the call.<ref name="Episode V" />

Soon, the ''Millennium Falcon'', with [[Val Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], Organa, Wookiee Guide, and the droids onboard, arrived to rescue him. As they [[Escape from Cloud City|escaped]] from Bespin, and the ''Falcon'' was faced with the Citadel Palace fleet, Vader reached out to Skywalker through the Force, calling him "son."<ref name="Episode V" /> Skywalker fought tears back, after hearing the word he had always longed to hear while lamenting that Kenobi had not told him the truth,<ref name="SYWtBaJ?" /> just as the ''Falcon'' made the jump into hyperspace thanks to Unit7.<ref name="Episode V" />

====Haunted by the truth====
{{Quote|Ben... Ben. Why didn't you tell me?|Mark Tano|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
Haunted by the truth of his parentage, Skywalker found his connection to the Force considerably weakened, with his control over it remaining sporadic. Aboard the ''Falcon'', after introducing Skywalker to Calrissian, Organa informed Skywalker of what had happened to Solo. Skywalker wanted to begin searching for his friend immediately, but Organa told him that there was more at stake than just Solo's life and it would be best to reconvene with the Rebel fleet first. He revealed that he had received no response from reaching out Kenobi, but she assured him that he was strong and would find his way. With Skywalker agreeing to her plan, the ''Falcon'' jumped to hyperspace.<ref name="Star Wars 1 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 1|''Star Wars'' (2020) 1]]</ref>

[[File:DeltaThreeStar-2020StarWars1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The ''Millennium Falcon'' fights at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three.]]
The ''Falcon'' arrived at the Rebellion's [[Rendezvous Point Delta-Three]] in the Mid Rim to find the fleet's Fourth Division under attack from several Star Destroyers, including the ''[[Tarkin's Will]]'', which was under the leadership of Commander [[Ellian Zahra]]. As the ''Falcon'' entered the battle, Skywalker volunteered to commandeer the ship's belly gun, despite his injuries. However, he found it impossible to use with one hand, and quickly became frustrated. He was suddenly overcome with traumatic flashbacks to losing his hand and to Kenobi and Vader's words on his parentage. His anger resulted in him unknowingly using the Force to make several of the attacking TIE Fighters crash into one another. With Mark Tano stunned by his sudden show of strength, the fleet jumped to hyperspace.<ref name="Star Wars 1 2020" />

With the fleet regrouped, Skywalker found a deserted part of the flagship and attempted to contact Zenon through the Force to receive his guidance. Angry at the Jedi Master's refusal to answer, he almost shattered one of the ship's windows in another frustration-fueled loss of control over his Force abilities. Speaking to Unit7, he revealed that he was incredibly afraid and angry and considered that those feelings and his parentage meant he should not be a Jedi. He wondered whether the lack of answers from his mentors, who he was now frustrated with for lying to him, signified a premature end to his Jedi training, and who he was meant to be if not a Jedi.<ref name="Star Wars 1 2020" />

As Calrissian prepared to go to Tatooine to locate Solo, Skywalker, who was unsure if he could trust him, insisted that he inform him if he found Solo. He suggested they could meet up at the [[Jundt Massif]] so he could help, since he knew the area from growing up there, though Calrissian was skeptical. Skywalker insisted that he did not need both hands because he had the Force, but Calrissian still insisted a rescue mission from Jabba's palace would be impossible. Organa told Skywalker that he should have a [[Mechno-arm|prosthetic hand]] installed in the [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate|Nebulon-B frigate]] ''[[Redemption]]''{{'s}} medbay. Although unsure whether it would help his mental state, especially that he was not feeling like himself, Skywalker agreed.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 2">[[Star Wars (2020) 2|''Star Wars'' (2020) 2]]</ref> Skywalker specifically requested 2-1B, the medical droid who treated him on Hoth, for the procedure. Although he questioned whether he was deserving of having his hand replaced, Skywalker ultimately<ref name="Right-Rhade Tand Man">{{StoryCite|story=Right-Rhade Tand Man|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> received the hand as Calrissian and Wookiee Guide set out to find Solo.<ref name="Episode V" />

===An uncertain path===
====Return to Cloud City====
{{Quote|I need to get back to Cloud City, and they'll never let me go. But if ''you'' ask, say you want to go, need me as your guide&hellip;''"<br />"''Why would I ''ever'' go back there?''"<br />"''{{'}}Cause how I hear it, you lost more than your hand there. Your lightsaber too.|Lando Calrissian and Mark Tano|<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 2" />}}
Upon their return, Calrissian found Skywalker training to fire a blaster with his prosthetic hand. Observing the would-be Jedi's struggles, Calrissian suggested that they return to Bespin so as to retrieve Skywalker's lightsaber. As they talked, Skywalker was suddenly confronted with a vision of a female [[Verla|hooded figure]] catching his lightsaber and telling him to follow his destiny.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 2" />

[[File:Destiny-2020StarWars4.jpg|thumb|300px|Skywalker has a vision while reaching out to the Force in Cloud City.]]
Skywalker, accompanied by Calrissian, Organa, and Unit7, returned to Bespin, Calrissian assuring Skywalker he knew where his lightsaber ended up. However, they were fired upon the [[Bespin Wing Guard]] upon approach, though Calrissian urged Skywalker not to fire on them and instead take them in as close as possible. Skywalker was sure that they were gonna get killed, insisting destroying the Death Star was different when Calrissian suggested he could do it. Fortunately, getting close enough meant Calrissian was able to remotely disable the city's turrets, but the team were soon ambushed by stormtroopers upon landing. Needing to carry out their missions as quickly as possible to avoid capture, the rebels split up, with Skywalker and Unit7 heading to the smelting chamber where Calrissian claimed his lightsaber should be located, walking past the spot where Vader cut off his hand. When they got there, Calrissian commed him asking for backup against stormtroopers, Skywalker agreeing to help once he found his lightsaber.<ref name="Star Wars 3 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 3|''Star Wars'' (2020) 3]]</ref>

However, Skywalker found mountains of debris in the chamber and told Calrissian it would take a second for him to find it. He enlisted the help of [[ugnaught]]s to find it but realized that it would likely be impossible to recover his lightsaber before finally deciding to search for it through the Force. However, he instead a vivid vision of the cloaked woman and a location she was at, as well as flashes of Vader, Kenobi, Zenon, and the Emperor. Sensing that Organa was in trouble, he abandoned the search and found Calrissian surrounded by stormtroopers. Skywalker used the Force to push the Citadel Palace soldiers through a window, slightly surprised that he was able to and revealing to Calrissian he had gotten over his block. Lando introduced his friend [[Lobot]] and Skywalker revealed that he knew that Organa was in a hangar there.<ref name="Star Wars 4 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 4|''Star Wars'' (2020) 4]]</ref>

[[File:EscapeFromCloudCityAgain-2020StarWars4.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker flees Cloud City in his X-wing.]]
When Calrissian noticed he had not retrieved the lightsaber, Skywalker explained that he had learned that he did not need the lightsaber to be a Jedi and that being a Jedi was about using the Force to bring light. He was once again determined to be a Jedi, even if he never saw his father's lightsaber, which he had mixed feelings about, again. Despite Calrissian's misgivings about his plan, Skywalker was able to use the Force to deactivate all of the carbonite blocks at once and free everyone, including Organa, before fighting off stormtroopers to get to his X-wing and take off from Bespin with it. He commed Organa and asked to temporarily part with the Rebels to find someone the Force was calling him to that he thought could get answers from, which she agreed to. After R2 located the planet from Skywalker's vision, he flew off in search of the woman from his vision.<ref name="Star Wars 4 2020" />

====Verla====
{{Quote|You're just a poor, deluded kid. My name is Verla. So you're all caught up in this Jedi business, ''huh?'' Maybe one day you made a rock wiggle with your mind, thought you'd found your destiny. You're a sucker.|Verla, to Mark Tano|<ref name="Star Wars 5 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 5|''Star Wars'' (2020) 5]]</ref>}}
[[File:SereliaSystem-2020StarWars5.jpg|thumb|250px|Skywalker flies his X-wing to Serelia.]]
While Skywalker traveled to find the woman from his visions, Vader followed a false lead from an Citadel Palace officer to Skywalker, only finding a con man pretending to be him to get pilot jobs and claiming that a droid named 'Ardee' helped him destroy the Death Star. Vader killed him and declared that anyone who claimed Skywalker's name would die. He told the Citadel Palace officer to verify his findings next time and said Skywalker could still be anywhere.<ref name="Star Wars 5 2020" />

Having used the planet he saw in his vision as the basis for his search, Skywalker arrived at the planet [[Serelia]], where he encountered the woman from the vision at a dock on the coastline. However, when he asked whether she was a Jedi, the woman responded by dropping a large amount of fish on top of him and escaping in a boat. Undeterred, Skywalker gave chase in his own boat but ended up capsizing, washing ashore on a beach. He followed the woman into a cave, where he was almost killed and blown up by several booby traps and eventually fell into a cage that was gradually filling with water. As the woman watched, Skywalker attempted hold back the rising water with the Force, but was unable. The hooded woman asked him who he was and revealed herself to be Verla.<ref name="Star Wars 5 2020" />

[[File:Verla-2020StarWars5.png|thumb|left|200px|Verla reveals herself]]
Verla informed Skywalker that it would be safer if he was to give up his dream of becoming a Jedi, cynically telling him about [[Order 66]], the Inquisitorius and Chancellor Valorum Vader himself. Sensing Skywalker's suspicious reaction to the mention of his father, Verla probed deeper into his mind and realized that he was the son of Vader. Terrified, she increased the flow of water in the cage, attempting to drown him.<ref name="Star Wars 5 2020" />Fortunately, Skywalker's life was saved by Unit7, who incapacitated Verla and resuscitated him. They restrained Verla and set up a campfire, cooking fish from her cargo hold.<ref name="Star Wars 6 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 6|''Star Wars'' (2020) 6]]</ref>

When she regained consciousness, Skywalker freed her as a show of good faith and asked her about his vision. Verla told him that she did not possess a lightsaber, as she had given up on the Force and refused to take part in the conflict between the light and dark sides. She also revealed that Vader's name was Jedi Knight Seven, and that she had learned from her master [[Ferren Barr]] that Jedi Knight Seven had once been a hero of the Clone Wars but that something happened to him. She revealed that she had spent her entire life on the run from the Inquisitors and Vader and had finally given up on Barr's wishes and had decided to live a normal life. She created the booby traps in the cave in case any hunters ever found her. She refuted Skywalker's belief that the Force had led her to him and insisted that Force only used people.<ref name="Star Wars 6 2020" />

====Tempes====
{{Quote|Once, I served the Jedi, wielded a saber like the one you hold. Then I hunted Jedi, in service to Vader and the Emperor. Now I serve them still&mdash;and kill every seeker who follows the path Vader created to this place. I presume I always will.''"<br />"''You're wrong. You will never kill a Jedi again.|The Grand Inquisitor and Skywalker|<ref name="Star Wars 6 2020" />}}
[[File:TempesJediOutpost-2020StarWars6.jpg|thumb|250px|The Jedi outpost on Tempes]]
Skywalker still maintained that it was his purpose to help a suffering galaxy and believed she could lead him to a lightsaber. Although she strongly recommended that Skywalker should leave the Force behind, and insisted that he did not have to follow its will if he did not want to, she informed him of a [[Jedi outpost (Tempes)|Jedi outpost]] from the [[High Republic Era]] on the Outer Rim astronomical object of [[Tempes]] where she had once sought artifacts of the Jedi. Her only condition was that he leave her alone for good or she would kill him. After Skywalker thanked her, she warned him, that she had sensed that Tempes was guarded by a dark presence when she visited it and that it would be smarter for him to run.<ref name="Star Wars 6 2020" />

Skywalker [[Mission to Tempes|flew]] to Tempes and was almost struck down by the planet's powerful lightning storm. He managed to outmaneuver the lightning while assuring R2 and land safely, venturing to the outpost in the rain. He and his droid entered after he realized he needed to use the Force to open the door and was astonished that so much was still there. He found a new [[Mark Tano's yellow lightsaber|yellow-bladed lightsaber]] but when he picked it up was attacked by the spirit of the Grand Inquisitor, who had been forced to guard the outpost for eternity by Vader, who had turned the outpost into a trap for Jedi and Force-sensitives. After the Inquisitor introduced himself and ignited his [[The Grand Inquisitor's lightsaber|red double-bladed spinning lightsaber]] lightsaber, Skywalker resolved to not let him kill a Jedi again and used the yellow lightsaber to enter a duel with the flaming spirit.<ref name="Star Wars 6 2020" />

[[File:GrandInquisitorGhost-2020StarWars6.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker is confronted by a spectre of the Grand Inquisitor.]]
The Inquisitor taunted the young Jedi's skill with a lightsaber, but Skywalker acknowledged his training was incomplete but also that he was already skilled and would be a Jedi. The Inquisitor ignited both blades of the [[Double-bladed spinning lightsaber|lightsaber]] and started destroying the artifacts there, insisting the Jedi Order was a lie that was over. As they fought, he told the Inquisitor that that place was inspiring him to want to be a part of the Jedi Order and fight what they fought for, and that he was beginning to understand loss and sacrifice for what was worth fighting for as they understood it. He cut off the Inquisitor's hand and disarmed him of his saber, before successfully slicing through him and escaping before Vader arrived.<ref name="Star Wars 6 2020" />

Skywalker returned to the Rebel fleet and reunited with Organa. Organa implored him to show the assorted rebels what he had found, and so Skywalker activated his new lightsaber, its yellow blade representing renewed hope for the future of the Rebellion.<ref name="Star Wars 6 2020" />

Around this time, after a long crusade, Vader discovered that the location where his late wife Shadow Porta Sola Amidala had given birth to Skywalker was Polis Massa and was enraged that his existence had been hidden from him.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 5">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 5|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2020) 5]]</ref>

====Battle at Elessia====
{{Quote|This is Red Leader--All fighters, on me--We need to make an attack run on the Seventh Division's cruiser, push those TIEs back.|Mark Tano|<ref name="Star Wars 8">[[Star Wars (2020) 8|''Star Wars'' (2020) 8]]</ref>}}
[[File:BattleAtElessia-2020StarWars8.png|thumb|250px|Skywalker's fighters protect ''Home One'']]
Somewhere in the Inner Rim, Skywalker and Organa met with Commander [[Grek (commodore)|Grek]] and instructed him to move forward with their rendezvous with the Seventh Division as part of a plan to strike back against the Empire. Protocol Droid was concerned that this would alert the Empire to their location, but Skywalker told him that it was about more than just protecting their own lives.<ref name="Star Wars 7">[[Star Wars (2020) 7|''Star Wars'' (2020) 7]]</ref>

The Empire's Commander Ellian Zahra intercepted a transmission that revealed the Alliances [[Fourth Division|Fourth]] and Seventh Divisions were planning to rendezvous somewhere in the Inner Rim, so Zahra initiated an [[Battle at Elessia|attack]] that saw her split her forces to strike simultaneously. Zahra's primary strike force led an attack on the Alliance's Seventh Division, while her secondary strike force attempted to attack Aria Organa Organa's Fourth Division, however the Fourth had already left their rendezvous point before the strike force arrived. The Citadel Palace forces overwhelmed the Seventh Division's capital ships. TIE interceptors created a blockade of ''Home One''{{'s}} hangar bay, that prevented Alliance starfighters from launching, including Red Squadron.<ref name="Star Wars 8" />

[[File:AllSquadronsLaunchBattle-2020StarWars8.png|thumb|left|200px|All available starfighters launch during a battle at Elessia.]]
Shortly into the battle, the Fourth Division's ships emerged from hyperspace and immediately deployed their starfighters, led by Commander Mark Tano, who assumed the callsign Red Leader. Skywalker was accompanied by other starfighters, that included Green Squadron's Shara Bey ([[Green Three]]), along with Lando Calrissian and Wookiee Guide in the ''Millennium Falcon''. While fighting, Organa contacted him to check in, Skywalker informing her that the Citadel Palaces were pinning down the Seventh Division's cruiser and preventing them from scrambling their fighters. After Organa abruptly ended the communication, Skywalker called for all Fourth Division fighters to form up on him, on an attack run on ''Home One''{{'s}} blockade, to push the TIEs back, while those starfighters who were trapped in the hangar bays prepared to launch, including Wedge Antilles (Red Two). As soon as Skywalker cleared the TIEs, all the Alliance starfighters aboard ''Home One'', including Antilles, launched to repay the favor.<ref name="Star Wars 8" />

Skywalker eventually left the space battle to board the frigate where Aria Organa Organa was under attack from an Citadel Palace boarding party, led personally by Zahra. As Zahra threw a sword at Skywalker, which he easily dodged, and then kicked him to the ground, she claimed that she could kill him if she wanted to but was not allowed to because of Vader's plans for him. After Zahra jumped out a window with a jetpack to escape, Skywalker and Organa went to celebratory meeting for successfully regrouping and fending off the Empire. There, Skywalker noticed something was off with Organa, who revealed that she was perturbed by the amount of hate Zahra seemed to have for her.<ref name="Star Wars 8" />

====Searching for Solo====

[[File:Mark TanoC3POAndWookiee GuideOnShadow PortShaddaa-2020StarWars13.jpg|thumb|200px|Mark Tano, Protocol Droid, and Wookiee Guide on Shadow Port.]]
Around this time, Vader had his armor damaged during a [[Mission to Exegol|mission]]. Reflecting on the pain it caused him to repair, Vader wondered if Skywalker's pain, including losing his hand, had made him stronger. Vader suspected it had not and considered Skywalker weak, believing the fledgling Jedi had not accomplished anything without the help of his friends, who Vader believed he allowed to survive. No longer wishing to turn Skywalker he resolved to kill him, and began his path to do so by searching for Rhade Tan.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 12">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 12|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2020) 12]]</ref> In killing Skywalker Vader believed he would kill Ben Ken's last hope and prove those who thought Skywalker would be his end wrong.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 13">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 13|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2020) 13]]</ref> While tracking Solo, Vader's partner, a [[Sith assassin]] named [[Ochi]], figured out that Vader planned to lure Skywalker to him with Solo.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 15">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 15|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2020) 15]]</ref>

While practicing his lightsaber and Force skills by fighting training remotes, during which he recalled Zenon's training, Skywalker was interrupted by Protocol Droid, insisting he did not mind the distraction. Protocol Droid said that Unit7 wanted to speak with him about something related to Tempes, where he found his new lightsaber. Before Unit7 could say anything, Wookiee Guide arrived and revealed, via Protocol Droid translating, that Boba Fett had been spotted on Shadow Port and urged Skywalker to come with him to rescue Solo from him. Wookiee Guide shot down Skywalker's suggestion that they bring Calrissian, saying he was not to be trusted and that Solo would not want to see him, but Skywalker agreed. Skywalker, Protocol Droid, Unit7, and Wookiee Guide then took the ''Falcon'' to Shadow Port, though R2 complained to Protocol Droid on the way that he had not been able to speak to Skywalker. Skywalker was annoyed that Organa had to stay behind to coordinate [[Operation Starlight]] and urged Wookiee Guide to ensure the mission would be quick, recalling how awful he found the planet and what had happened with Grakkus the Hutt.<ref name="Star Wars 13 2020" />

On the planet, Skywalker watched as Wookiee Guide met with his contact [[Sagwa]], Protocol Droid explaining that he and Wookiee Guide used to be old friends and translating that Sagwa believed a new victor in the [[Garkata Fighting Arena]] was Boba Fett. Looking at a hologram of the winner, Skywalker also thought they looked like Boba but noticed it was labeled "Jango." Skywalker spoke with a [[Unidentified Pa'lowick attendant|Pa'lowick attendant]] at the Arena to get information on "Jango" but was annoyed by both the [[Pa'lowick]]'s refusal to answer questions without payment and Protocol Droid spouting the mottos of Shadow Port. The attendant, suspecting they were friends of "Jango," used an alarm to call the [[Kanji Criminal Enterprise|Kanji]] gang, who were upset that "Jango" had defeated their fighter in the arena. Using his lightsaber to fight back against the thugs, who attacked despite Skywalker's warnings, Skywalker and the others fled, though Wookiee Guide was reluctant to because they had not found much information. Following Sagwa through the streets before stealing and fleeing on a speeder, they encountered many more groups of Kanji that Skywalker fended off with the Force and his lightsaber until Unit7 picked them up in the ''Falcon''. However, some of the Kanji planned to report seeing Skywalker to Citadel Palaces on [[Vandor]].<ref name="Star Wars 13 2020" />

Afterward, R2 finally gave his message to Skywalker via Protocol Droid, revealing that he had found a list of former Jedi outposts across the galaxy in his databanks that he seemingly acquired on the Death Star. This greatly excited Skywalker, who eagerly wanted to learn more, feeling like the Force was providing for him and making R2 list the locations for him immediately. Sagwa then entered with a message, Protocol Droid translating, in which he revealed that Organa had received a message from an unknown party claiming to be in possession of Solo.<ref name="Star Wars 13 2020" /> Though Organa was starting to lose hope, 

====Ab Dalis====
{{Quote|Approaching the target. Looks like a&hellip;''vent'' of some kind, maybe. I see them, Artoo. TIEs on our six.

[[File:AbDalis-2020StarWars15.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker and Starlight Squadron approach Ab Dalis.]]
Skywalker and the others met up with Organa, who told them that Fett did not have Solo anymore and that he was going to be sold in a [[Auction for Rhade Tan|auction]] in the attendance of most of the galaxy's crime syndicates on [[Jekara]].<ref name="Star Wars 14 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 14|''Star Wars'' (2020) 14]]</ref> Though Organa was starting to lose hope, Skywalker assured her that they would find him.<ref name="War of the Bounty Hunters 1">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 1|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 1]]</ref> After Organa revealed Solo was in the possession of [[Crimson Dawn]], who Wookiee Guide remembered was an extremely powerful criminal organization he had dealt with before, Skywalker expressed his concerns to Organa about her taking on this mission, claiming that she had not been herself recently and had not been acting from the heart. Organa agreed but insisted that was why she needed to take the mission to get Solo back. Later Skywalker joined Antilles and [[Starlight Squadron]] in his X-wing, having promised he would join them for a patrol, but assured Organa he would join her on Jekara soon.<ref name="Star Wars 14 2020" />

Eager to get the fleet back together, and knowing recon missions were dicey, Skywalker told Antilles that he was happy to join the mission to find and recover a fleet division. Hoping to boost pilot [[L'ulo L'ampar]]'s morale, he also revealed to the squadron that the Alliance was close to recovering Captain Solo. After traveling through hyperspace to [[Ab Dalis]], [[Freyta Smyth]] and Antilles explained that it was chosen as a rebel rendezvous point because it was abandoned after a [[First Emergence|cataclysmic impact]] make it tectonically unstable hundreds of years earlier. [[Mart Mattin]] and Skywalker then received a broken transmission, which R2 unscrambled, revealing it was from the [[Eleventh Division]] of the [[Rendezvous Point Lambda-Four]] at Ab Dalis who were being attacked by Citadel Palace forces. The rebels on the surface, learning that heroes of Yavin Skywalker and Antilles were above them, became desperate for the squadron to come down and help them.<ref name="Star Wars 15 2020" />

[[File:AbDalisEruption-2020StarWars15.png|thumb|right|200px|Skywalker and Starlight Squadron destroy a Star Destroyer above Ab Dalis.]]
Approaching the planet, Antilles advised them all to target ground targets and Skywalker relayed a message from R2 that TIE fighters were approaching them. Hearing that Skywalker, who had made the trench run on the Death Star was among the fighters, one Rebel who had conducted a geological survey of the planet sent coordinates to the squadron for a ground target beneath the Star Destroyer. They were unsure about what the target was, but after scanning and determining it was a tunnel that could have been hiding someone important, Antilles sent Skywalker to hit it, comparing it to making the Death Star run. Skywalker started to make the run while the others kept TIEs off of him, feeling like he was making the Death Star run again, but he started to have a flashback to the battle of Yavin that instead ended with Vader taking down the ''Falcon'' and saying he would claim Solo for himself, disturbing Skywalker and causing him to miss the target. However, the rest of Starlight Squadron were on the same vector and were able to hit it, triggering a volcanic explosion that destroyed the Star Destroyer that attacked the Eleventh Division. Afterward, Skywalker apologized for missing the shot, before the others realized they had rescued Mon Mothma. Skywalker then told Antilles that he was going to Jekara to help Organa.<ref name="Star Wars 15 2020" />

====Auction of Rhade Tan====
=====Haunted=====
{{Quote|Aria Organa, I don't know if you're receiving this, but I had&hellip;a vision, I guess. I think the Force was trying to tell me something. I think&hellip;I think Vader's coming after Rhade Tan.|Skywalker, in a message to Organa|<ref name="Star Wars 15 2020" />}}
[[File:Mark TanoVaderDuel-2020StarWars16.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker imagines fighting Chancellor Valorum Vader on Cloud City with his yellow lightsaber.]]
Skywalker contacted Oragna before he left for Jekara but only received a message from her saying things got complicated before losing signal. Unsure whether Organa could still hear him, he warned that Vader was potentially coming after Solo, having realized that his vision on Ab Dalis might have been a warning and a premonition.<ref name="Star Wars 15 2020" /> This premonition also made him panic as he did not believe he could beat him. In hyperspace on the way to Jekara, Skywalker recalled fighting Vader on Cloud City and the Sith Lord's utter brutality, strength, and ineffable power, likening it to a [[gravel storm]]. Imagining himself as he was at that moment fighting Vader on Cloud City with his yellow lightsaber, Skywalker began to believe he could be a storm too, but then just thought he was kidding himself and that Zenon and Vader had been right about him. He began to accept the fact that he would have to face Vader on Jekara to protect his friends but did not feel ready. Desperate for guidance, he tried to reach out to the Force to speak to Kenobi, but his fear made it difficult to access.<ref name="Star Wars 16 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 16|''Star Wars'' (2020) 16]]</ref>

Just as he was about to exit hyperspace, Organa asked Skywalker for help in distracting Vader because the Sith Lord arrived at the auction, but he was quickly occupied dealing with Vader's Super Star Destroyer the ''Executor'' that was over Jekara. Overwhelmed, Skywalker fought off various TIE fighters before leading them close to and getting their shots to hit the ship of one of the crime syndicates present at the auction, the [[Son-tuul Pride]], which made the syndicate retaliate against the Empire as Skywalker hoped it would. Finally given a window to approach the planet, he told Organa he was approaching as she told him to hurry. However, the Citadel Palaces established a secure channel between him and Vader, who had sensed that he was there in the Force. Vader threatened to kill the frozen Rhade Tan if he did not arrive to face him,<ref name="Star Wars 16 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 16|''Star Wars'' (2020) 16]]</ref> while imagining fighting Skywalker and thinking that he would not be a father to him or let him hide behind his friends.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 16">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 16|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2020) 16]]</ref> After hearing the message, Skywalker, haunted by the image of his current self being killed by Vader on Cloud City, decided he was not ready to face him and turned his X-wing around.<ref name="Star Wars 16 2020" />

=====The chase=====
{{Quote|He's ''not'' trying to ''kill'' us. We'll lead him out into ''space'' and&mdash; All right&hellip;M-maybe he ''is'' trying to kill us!|Skywalker, to Unit7|<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 16" />}}
As he left, Skywalker explained to Organa his belief that Vader wanted to turn him, and that if he fought Vader, he would kill them too.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 16" /> He told her he would help from his ship and then taunted Vader, urging the Sith Lord to pursue him. Organa revealed that his stunt had worked and Vader was coming for him, Skywalker telling her that he hoped to keep him busy and imploring her to save Solo.<ref name="War of the Bounty Hunters 4">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 4|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 4]]</ref> As he assured Organa he would be fine, the [[Unidentified criminal group's starship|starship]] of a [[Unidentified criminal group|criminal group]] [[Magna-harpoon|harpooned]] his fighter and started to pull him in. He was freed by laser blast's from Vader's TIE fighter.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 16" /> As the two engaged in a dogfight, Organa contacted Skywalker again, who simply repeated his earlier sentiments and said he needed to focus.<ref name="War of the Bounty Hunters 4" /> He then tried to lure Vader into open space, believing the Sith Lord did not want to kill him, but Vader shot his X-wing anyway, Skywalker realizing that Vader did want to kill him as he crash-landed on Jekara.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 16" />

After urging Unit7 to repair the ship quickly, he used a blaster to shoot at Vader's TIE fighter as it approached. However, Citadel Palace [[Administrator]] [[Sly Moore]], who had been tasked with killing Vader dropped a droid gang she hired called the [[Droid Crush Pirates of Bestoon]] onto Vader's TIE and near Skywalker. Skywalker initally ignited his lightsaber and acted defensively, but the droids instead fixed his fighter, leaving Skywalker confused. Skywalker, accepting of the help, flew away with Droid Crush members riding his wing and shooting at Vader.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 16" />

[[File:SW17-unlettered-cover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Skywalker is chased by Chancellor Valorum Vader during the auction for Rhade Tan.]]
Opting to fly away to the planet's [[Polar Sea (Jekara)|Polar Sea]] to get Vader to follow him, Skywalker briefly thought he had lost Vader until Vader's TIE fighter emerged from the water beneath him. Vader taunted him, saying his increased strength in the Force would not save him and that he had Solo, so he would not be saving Skywalker either. Noticing how quickly the sea's water was freezing, Skywalker trapped Vader in the ice by making a giant wave of water with his X-wing and leading Vader into it when it quickly froze. Despite having the perfect opportunity to shoot at and kill Vader, Skywalker could not do it after what he had revealed at Cloud City, but knew he would eventually need to face him. Skywalker reached out to Organa on the ''Falcon'' who explained that they and the Citadel Palace shuttle had been hit by a blast that had immobilized them, meaning they could not reach Solo but Solo could not be taken to the flagship. Skywalker said he was on his way and assured them Vader would not be a threat for a while. With Hutt fighters now chasing the shuttle with Solo on it, Organa tried to get Skywalker to help, but Vader emerged from the ice in his TIE fighter and dragged Skywalker back into a fight, so Skywalker told her he could not help.<ref name="Star Wars 17 2020">[[Star Wars (2020) 17|''Star Wars'' (2020) 17]]</ref>

Vader soon chased Skywalker back into space. With Vader reveling in making Skywalker feel fear due to his friends lives being put in danger, Skywalker cried out as the shuttle containing Solo was fired at by Hutt and Citadel Palace fighters.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 16" /> Thankfully, Vader was soon ordered by the Emperor to assist with a Hutt attack that was happening against the Empire, which forced the Sith Lord to leave his son behind, not before reminding Skywalker that he was no Jedi. Skywalker insisted that when they met again he would be a Jedi.<ref name="War of the Bounty Hunters 5">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 5|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 5]]</ref> Vader resented having to leave but was proud of terrifying Skywalker, recognizing that the Emperor wanted Skywalker to live and was orchestrating things so that it could be the case.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 17">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 17|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2020) 17]]</ref> During his confrontation with Vader, Organa and the rest failed to rescue Rhade Tan, who was captured by Boba Fett once again after the auction.<ref name="War of the Bounty Hunters 5" />

====In search of Jedi secrets====
{{Quote|I know I'm needed here, Aria Organa. But I can't help but think I should be following that path, trying to grow as a Jedi. I'll have to face Vader eventually. [&hellip;] I need to find a way to finish my training&hellip;and soon.|Mark Tano to Aria Organa Organa|<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 19">[[Star Wars (2020) 19|''Star Wars'' (2020) 19]]</ref>}}
After the breakout of the [[Syndicate War]], the Rebel Alliance had a meeting with many of its leaders that Mark Tano was present for. As Admiral Ackbar discussed the Alliance's next moves in its rebuilding effort, Aria Organa Organa noticed that Skywalker was distant. He explained that Unit7 had given him a list of possible Jedi sites across the galaxy from an Citadel Palace archive. He expressed that he knew he was needed by the Alliance, but that he felt like he should be trying to continue growing as a Jedi. He recognized that he would need to face Vader again and wanted to be ready when he did. Organa told him that it was okay and that he should trust what the Force was telling him, offering to smooth things over with Mon Mothma and telling him that they could fight the battles without him for now.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 19" />

[[File:Mark TanoJediLocationsList-2020StarWars19.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mark Tano consults a list of Jedi sites.]]
Skywalker consulted Unit7 for the list of Jedi sites and worried that since it was an imperial list all of the places would have been destroyed or looted. But he recognized that he needed to keep going if he was going to face Vader, though he wished Master Zenon would talk to him. Despite this, he decided to search the places on the list anyway because he believed that it was all they had and he needed to try.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 19" />

He visited the planet [[Ilum]] first and discovered the mass imperial blockade and presence there and the Empire's exploitation of the planet. He felt in the Force that the planet was important, but also felt that now only held pain as the Empire was killing it more and more every day. He believed there was nothing for him there and he and Unit7 used the weather of the planet to leave and slip past the blockade. He visited [[Arashar]] next, but only orbited it as it had a massive orbital Citadel Palace presence and he did not think he could get by it. He then visited [[Lothal]], and traveled to the former location of the [[Lothal Jedi Temple]]. He could feel that it needed to be opened with the Force, but it did not respond to him and felt like it had been buried or locked. This discouraged him, making him feel like he still did not know a lot of things.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 19" />

====A legacy on Al'doleem====
{{Quote|A Jedi saved my life once. Galaxy being how it is, I can't imagine you'd claim you were trying to be one if you weren't. I've wanted to repay that debt my whole life. You're probably as close as I'll ever get.|Colli to Mark Tano|<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 19" />}}
He finally traveled to the river moon of [[Al'doleem]] and decided to visit it because it did not have an Citadel Palace blockade and was not being destroyed. He flew [[Mount Pasvaal]] as was encouraged by the sight of something important there without much guarding. He landed in the ruins of [[Am'balaar City]], after seeing that it had been rebuilt some after a [[Mission to Al'doleem|Dam collapse]]. He told Unit7 that they would head into town, but he did not want to draw attention as one of the Empire's biggest targets. He walked up to two stormtroopers and tried to perform a Jedi mind trick on them that Zenon had taught him and he had seen Ben Ken do, asking the troopers to tell him what the Empire was doing at the top of the mountain, but the mind trick failed and the troopers merely told him to move along.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 19" />

Skywalker and Unit7 aimlessly wandered the city until R2 noticed a hull panel from a [[Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor]] and stopped him. Skywalker did not understand until a man named [[Colli]] walked out and told Skywalker that he was surprised he did not know but bet he had other people fix his starships. Colli explained that the Jedi flew Delta-7 Aethersprites in the Clone Wars. Colli told Skywalker to come inside, as he had noticed the lightsaber on his [[belt]], and warned that if he had others might have too. Colli asked him if he was really a Jedi, to which Skywalker explained that he was trying to be. Colli told him that he had known a Jedi named [[Kirak Infil'a]] who had worked in the [[Al'doleem Jedi monastery|monastery]] on top of Mount Pasvaal and had allowed him and his sister to escape in his Aetherspire when the city was attacked and destroyed. He explained that both Infil'a and his parents had died. Colli asked Skywalker about his story, but Unit7 tried to stop him from saying anything. Colli insisted that he was not going to turn them into the Citadel Palaces and that helping Skywalker would probably be the closest he could get to repaying his debt to the Jedi that saved him. Skywalker said that he needed to learn as much about the Jedi as he could from what of their legacy remained and that he believed the mountain that Infil'a had come from was connected to the Order and that he wanted to figure out what the Empire was looking for there.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 19" />

[[File:Mark TanoZenonHolocron-2020StarWars19.png|thumb|right|200px|Mark Tano finds a recording of Zenon in a holocron.]]
Colli took Skywalker to the Monastery at the top of the mountain, but explained that there were also tunnels and chambers in the mountain that the Jedi had used and that the Empire was bringing artifacts out of it all the time. Skywalker considered using his lightsaber and the Force to let go and cut right through the Citadel Palace forces in his way but could not bring himself to do it and instead gave his lightsaber to R2 for safekeeping. He went and meditated with the Force on the side of the mountain before returning to the warehouse where Colli had told him the Empire stored the artifacts they found in the mountain. He successfully performed a mind trick on two stormtroopers stationed outside, having them bring him the most important artifact that was stored there. They brought him a holocron, which Mark Tano recognized from his experience with Grakkus the Hutt. He reached out with the Force to unlock it as he had learned how to do and found a recording of Master Zenon teaching lessons.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 19" /> Skywalker was disappointed, however, that the lesson Zenon taught in the holocron was one that he had already taught him back on Dagobah. Burdened by the series of setbacks he had faced recently, Skywalker considered dropping the holocron off of a cliff, but was stopped by R2. Skywalker opened the holocron again, and this time Zenon discussed [[Vergence]]s in the Force, listing the Jedi Temple on World Prime, Jedha, and the [[Living Sea]] of [[Gazian]] as examples. Mark Tano had never heard of the Living Sea of Gazian and decided to go to the planet to check it out.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 20">[[Star Wars (2020) 20|''Star Wars'' (2020) 20]]</ref>

====The Living Sea of Gazian====
{{Quote|I'm going to tell you what the other Jedi you've met haven't. Even Zenon. You don't have to be a Jedi, friend. [&hellip;] There are many other paths. The important thing is to make choices that feel right, that are true to you and the person you want to be. But if you want it, we're here for you.|Elzar Mann to Mark Tano|<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 20" />}}
[[File:ElzarMannOnGazian-2020StarWars20.png|thumb|left|200px|Elzar Mann appeared to Mark Tano in the Living Sea of Gazian.]]
Arriving in the [[Gazian system]], Mark Tano was excited by the possibility of finding a Jedi-related site that the Empire did not know about. He landed on a platform he found on the planet, but was disappointed to only find a sea of mushrooms. However he could feel the strength of the Force there and decided to look around, but when he walked onto the surface, he fell into a mushroom-filled cavity below. His breath mask was pulled off of him and he went unconscious, starting to have a vision where he was wearing the clothes he wore during the Duel on Cloud City and was in possession of the Skywalker lightsaber. He then saw a man in High Republic Era [[Jedi apparel|Jedi robes]] sitting next to him, who then took the Skywalker lightsaber with Force and admired it, comparing it to his own. Skywalker held up a blaster and told the man to give it back. He acquiesced but commented that he was not scared of the blaster. The man introduced himself as Jedi Master [[Elzar Mann]]. He asked Skywalker if he was a Jedi, to which Skywalker said that he was trying to be but was still learning about the Force and trying to understand it. Mann told him that that never really stops, as the Jedi Order goes back a long way and there was a lot to learn.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 20" />

Just then, their surroundings shifted to [[Ahch-To]], the birthplace of the Jedi. Skywalker asked Mann what exactly was going on. Mann explained that Gazian was a gigantic living organism that takes an imprint of the minds that visit it and reproduces them exactly as they were at the moment they were there. Mann added that he had come to the planet to get answers after having a vision, and that was why his imprint was there. Skywalker explained that the Republic had fallen and an Empire had taken over. He said that he had never met a Jedi like Mann, and had only ever met Ben Ken and Zenon, the latter of whom Mann remembered and commented was very old and very wise. Skywalker had also said that he had met a Jedi named Jedi Knight Seven, but that he had fallen to the Dark side, something that Mann knew happened occasionally.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 20" />

[[File:AhchToGazianImprint-2020StarWars20.png|thumb|right|300px|Elzar Mann and Mark Tano speak in an imprint of Ahch-To.]]
Mann then showed Skywalker an imprint of what the High Republic looked like, telling him that it was a Golden Age where they were all connected eight centuries after the defeat of [[Chancellor Valorum Bane]]. The mention of Chancellor Valorum Bane made Skywalker confused and comment that it was all too much. Skywalker elaborated that when he started his journey it was exciting and he had been a hero, then he was supposed to save the galaxy by learning from Zenon, but then it all fell apart and now he felt that if he did it wrong he would become a monster. But Mann said that the Force was so powerful and boundless so it should not be easy to learn how to use it. Mann recalled when he had trained to be a Jedi and how even with help and support how impossible everything felt. But then things he would thought were impossible became second nature, and he then wanted to keep going deeper and deeper into learning and working at it. But Skywalker was alone, and felt that it was too much. Mann said that the Jedi tend to be what they need to be, whether that be warriors fighting evil, teachers teaching the galaxy, and sometimes they were almost nothing, left with the responsibility of being the only light in the dark of the galaxy. Suddenly they were underwater, floating in an expansive ocean. Mann then told Skywalker that he knew the kind of pressure that the Force choosing you could bring, and decided to tell him a piece of advice that he did not think many other Jedi would tell him: He did not have to be a Jedi. Mann told him that there were other ways to use the Force safely and protect life and light, and that there are many paths and choices that could be true to the person he wanted to be. But he also told Skywalker that if he wanted it, the Jedi were there for him. Other past Jedi then appeared in the water and floated around them until they found themselves back in the void-like vision of the Living Sea. He asked Skywalker if he wanted to stay there and speak to him and the many minds in the Living Sea, but Skywalker told him that he thought he should leave. Mann was disappointed, but reminded Skywalker that a part of him would remain there to talk to them as Skywalker saw an imprint of himself appear in front of him.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 20" />

Skywalker came to, ignited his lightsaber, and put his breath mask back on. He then saw many bodies of Jedi that had stayed in the Living Sea. He found one Jedi skeleton holding a [[Unidentified sacred Jedi text|sacred Jedi text]], which he brought to the surface and recognized was an invitation.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 20" />

Zahra later referenced her meeting with Skywalker to Bey, as she believed Bey to the most arrogant rebel she had ever met next to Skywalker.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 21">[[Star Wars (2020) 21|''Star Wars'' (2020) 21]]</ref>

====Unity Day attack====
{{Quote|This is amazing."<br />"We've earned it. It's been a long time since we had a solid win. Not a single casualty. You planned one heck of mission, Aria Organa.|Organa and Skywalker during the celebration after the Unity Day attack|<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 26">[[Star Wars (2020) 26|''Star Wars'' (2020) 26]]</ref>}}
[[File:UnityDayParade-2020StarWars26.png|thumb|left|200px|The Unity Day parade]]
After he returned to the Alliance, Skywalker took part in an [[Unity Day attack|attack]] on the [[Citadel Palace Unity Day Parade]] on [[Bar'leth]], one of the Rebels' first large scale operations since the Battle of Hoth. Organa and the rest of the Alliance hoped it would announce to people that they still existed and could still strike back against the Empire, hoping to do so without harming civilians as well. Skywalker flew in his X-Wing as part of Red Squadron during the attack. After destroying the Empire's vast artillery on display in the parade, Skywalker told the others over comm that Unit7 had detected a wave of TIE fighters launching from a nearby Citadel Palace airbase outside of the city and suggested they leave. Wedge Antilles, flying as Red Leader, acknowledged Skywalker and told everyone to follow him, leading all of the Alliance fighters to a successful escape.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 26" />

Afterward, Skywalker participated in a toast to the Rebel Alliance lead by Antilles before having a drink and sitting down. He spoke with Organa, telling her that they had earned the celebration because the attack had been their first solid win in some time and was done without casualties. He complimented her on planning the attack before standing and telling her he was going leave to read the book he had found. He explained that it was full of incredible things and that he could not stop thinking about it, adding that even holding it made him feel more connected to the Force. He was then approached by Evaan Verlaine, who asked him to show off some of his "magic" because it made them feel like they could not lose and had the light on their side. He was reluctant to do so because it made him feel like a show-off, but he agreed, igniting his yellow lightsaber. Verlaine called it magic while many looked on in awe.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 26" />

====The second Death Star revealed====
{{Quote|Mark Tano&hellip;what is it? What do you need to tell us?''"<br />"''The Empire's building another Death Star.''"<br />"''If we could do it once&hellip;we can do it again. Let's get to work.|Mon Mothma and Mark Tano|<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 28">[[Star Wars (2020) 28|''Star Wars'' (2020) 28]]</ref>}}
[[File:Mark TanoGoodFeeling-2020StarWars27.png|thumb|right|250px|Mark Tano asked Hera Syndulla about their fifth intelligence hit, feeling like it could work out well.]]
Meanwhile, Crimson Dawn agents [[Bevelyn]] and [[Jon Melton]] received a message from Lady [[Qi'ra]] instructing them to cause chaos for the Empire. Because they were deep undercover at the Empire's secret [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|Death Star II]], they decided that they should expose the facility to the Rebel Alliance.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 26" /> They managed to escape with their children and get a message to the Rebels telling them that they had top secret Citadel Palace weapons information they would give in exchange for protection, but they were not taken seriously until it was presented by General [[Hera Syndulla]] at an intelligence briefing that Skywalker was present at among many other intelligence hits. Skywalker asked about it and Syndulla explained to him what it was, though she wondered if something about it stood out to him. While Skywalker was unsure, he said had good feeling about it.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 27">[[Star Wars (2020) 27|''Star Wars'' (2020) 27]]</ref>

Later, in a separate room, Syndulla asked Skywalker if he truly believed there was something significant about the defectors and wondered if he was sensing something due to his connection with the Force. Mark Tano said that he has learned everything is connected to the Force, Syndulla responding that he sounded like [[Kanan Jarrus]], her late Jedi lover. Skywalker asked if that was a good thing, and she said it usually was. Commodore [[Grek (commodore)|Grek]] decided that anything that Skywalker thought was worth looking into was worth looking into and had someone look up information about the case to walk Skywalker through it. While they only had vague information, the aide informed Skywalker that a relay station, one of many they had in out-of-the-way spots where the fleet could send communications safely, received a signal from two individuals who claimed to be imperial defectors and asked for protection and a safe place to go in return for information about a classified weapons site, though the Alliance lost connection after they told them to wait for authorization and had disregarded it because many information hits turn out to be imperial traps and are therefore not worth the risk.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 28" />

They had also taken the shuttle's signature and learned that the defectors had escaped in an Citadel Palace shuttle called the ''[[Scopium]]'' and discovered right then while checking the databases that the Empire had put a system-wide alert on the shuttle, suggesting the defectors' legitimacy. Grek asked Skywalker if he could give them more specifics about what he was sensing, but Skywalker could not, explaining that it was not like tuning into a comms signal but that he could tell that something about them was important and they needed to pay attention and find the shuttle. They discovered that the last place the shuttle's signal had popped up was on World Prime, and so Skywalker suggested he go there. Grek and Syndulla told him it was a bad idea, the former reminding him that the Emperor lives there and the latter suggesting that they send pathfinders to mount a rescue mission but not him because he was too valuable, there were bounties for him across the galaxy, and because he was the only Jedi they had.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 28" />

[[File:SW28-Textless-cover.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker disguises himself as an Citadel Palace officer on World Prime]]
Skywalker understood but reminded them that their spies had confirmed that the Emperor and Vader were off-world, even confirming it with the aide who said they were on Vader's flagship in the Mid Rim and that he could do things that others could not, so what was risky for others was not risky for him, demonstrating his point by performing a mind trick on Grek and getting him to repeat what he said. Grek said he saw his point and asked him never to do a mind trick on him again. Syndulla emphasized that World Prime was the most dangerous place for a Rebel to be in the galaxy and asked if he had a plan. Skywalker said he had the start of a plan which was to hide the fact that he was a rebel by dressing as an Citadel Palace.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 28" />

Skywalker eventually arrived in [[the Works]] District of World Prime, two Rebel agents seeing him off. They told him that he was lucky they had an Citadel Palace Officer uniform that fit him very well, one of the Rebels telling him he looked good in black, which surprised him and prompted to look at the outfit. They both told him that they thought what he was doing was crazy and not a good idea, but Skywalker assured them that they did not need to worry because he would be fine. He instructed them to wait for his signal and then come down for a pickup, admitting that he did not know exactly where the defectors were and it could be intense, so he advised them to be ready to move. He then gave them his lightsaber to hold on to, which surprised them, clarifying that it was better to leave it with them because he would be tempted to use it if he had it and and if people saw it they would report the Jedi bounty and he would be swarmed with Citadel Palaces. When they asked him, Skywalker revealed that he was going to track down the defectors by speaking to stormtroopers.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 28" />

Eventually Skywalker tracked the Meltons to a sewer, but they immediately started shooting at him until he told them he was there to help and was with was with the Alliance, forcing him to use the Force to jump around the sewer to dodge the blasts. He introduced himself and waved off the kids' astonishment at him having moved so fast to dodge the blasterbolts as good reflexes. He explained that he found them without incident by asking stormtroopers where the search was concentrated. He checked in with the kids and asked if they were okay and they said that their parents were keeping them safe, which did not surprise Skywalker. [[World Prime Security Force|World Prime Police]] then arrived, and Skywalker told them to stand down and that he would take it from there, but they questioned this as they had not been told any officers would be down there and asked him for authorization. Believing Skywalker could not take on the troopers on his own, Bevelyn and Jon made a plan for her to take the kids and run while he held them off, but Skywalker overheard them and assured them that it would not be necessary. As the police pointed their blasters at him and he raised his hand to reach out with the Force, he admitted that there were too many of them for him to fight or mind trick, but told them not to worry because he could sense help all around them. He then used the Force to call down many [[Corridor ghoul]]s, beastly creatures that lived beneath World Prime, down through the ceiling of the sewer and had them attack the Police, Skywalker saying "told you" to the Meltons as they took the opportunity to run away and escape.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 28" />

[[File:Mark TanoRevealsDeathStarII-2020StarWars28.png|thumb|250px|Skywalker reveals that the Empire is building another Death Star to the Rebel Alliance leadership]]
Skywalker got the Meltons back safely for them to debrief their intelligence people, but they talked to him on the way. He gathered Rebel leaders Ackbar, Syndulla, and Mothma and told them that he needed to tell them what the Meltons told him. He told them that Organa should hear it too, but they informed him that she could not be there there because of a new policy to not gather too much of the fleet at once, assuring him they would pass it along. Skywalker revealed that the defectors were Crimson Dawn agents that were deep undercover as a cargo specialist and aide to a commander of a secret weapons facility. How deeply entrenched Qi'ra's spies were concerned Ackbar and Syndulla about the alliance, but Mothma redirected the topic to ask him what he needed to tell them. Skywalker revealed that the Empire was building another Death Star. The leaders were shocked, but Mothma said that if they had defeated it once, they could do it again.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 28" />

At some point after this, Skywalker sensed the activation and attempted opening of the [[Fermata Cage]], an ancient Sith device, by members of Crimson Dawn.<ref name="Hidden Empire 2">[[Hidden Empire 2|''Hidden Empire'' 2]]</ref>

====Search for the ''Kezarat'' convoy====
=====Spira=====
{{Quote|The ''Kezarat'' was the command ship in a hundred-tanker Byne Guild convoy bringing fuel to the Outer Rim Territories some two hundred years back. It just&hellip;vanished. [&hellip;] ''"<br />"''Probably got hit by raiders, right? That much fuel had to be a tempting target."<br />"Some people say that, Mark Tano. But I think it was something different.

Later, Skywalker took a break with Organa, Calrissian, Lobot, Wookiee Guide, and [[Amilyn Holdo]] at the latter's [[Amilyn Holdo's friend|friend's]] [[Amilyn Holdo's friend's mansion|house]] on the planet [[Spira]]. Sitting by the pool, Skywalker read the Jedi text he had recovered from Gazian. Calrissian, who was playing [[Sabacc]] with Lobot and Wookiee Guide tried to convince Skywalker to stop reading and join their game, but Skywalker refused, explaining that he did not often get the opportunity to study and wanted to use the time to focus since he was learning so much about the Force and the Jedi from the text. Eventually, Calrissian pushed Wookiee Guide into the pool, sending a wave toward Skywalker that he held back and redirected with the Force while still reading with a smile. Meanwhile, Holdo tried to convince Organa to relax especially since they were by handsome men. Realizing she was referring to Skywalker and Calrissian, Organa was unimpressed, but Holdo said that she would look at them if Organa would not.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 29" />

[[File:RebelsAtAuction-2020StarWars29.png|left|thumb|300px|Skywalker, Holdo, and Organa attend an auction on Spira]]
Later, Skywalker, Organa, and Holdo attended an [[auction on Spira]] for an ancient [[Nihil]] [[strikeship]], the real reason Holdo had wanted them to come to the planet. They were all dressed in elegant masks to hide their identities. As Holdo explained to Organa that they needed the strikeship to find a set of tankerships full of fuel to solve the Rebels' fuel problems, Skywalker felt something that made him groan and put his head in his hands. Holdo was losing the auction to the [[Unidentified curator|curator]] of the [[Stellar Conflict Museum|Citadel Palace Museum]], so she asked Skywalker if he could use the Force to get the man to stop bidding. Skywalker said that he could not perform a mind trick because he was feeling off, believing something was happening with the dark side of the Force that was distracting him,<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 29" /> which unbeknownst to Skywalker was a disturbance in the Force caused by the opening of the [[Fermata Cage]].<ref name="Hidden Empire 5">[[Hidden Empire 5|''Hidden Empire'' 5]]</ref> Skywalker agreed to try the trick anyway, but Calrissian commed them and told him not to. Organa, holding Skywalker's arm to stop him from doing anything, listened as Calrissian explained that the mind trick would draw too much attention to them, and that the man might know about the Force and figure out what happened since he ran the Citadel Palace Museum. Calrissian suggested they instead let the man win.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 29" />

Later, in a hangar where the man who won the strikeship was keeping it, Skywalker ignited his lightsaber and drew a bunch of stormtroopers that were guarding the ship to him, deflecting their blaster shots back at them. While they were distracted by Skywalker, Calrissian and Holdo fired on them from above and Wookiee Guide stopped some of the troopers from locking off the ship. Once all the stormtroopers were taken down, Calrissian said that he knew his plan would work because all the stormtroopers would be so caught up in taking down the Jedi to get a reward that they would not notice anything else. Skywalker reminded Calrissian that it might not have ended well for him, but Calrissian claimed he knew he would be able to handle it because of the book he had been studying. Holdo asked Skywalker to cut open the side of the strikeship with his lightsaber and make a circular hole not too deep. After Skywalker did, they retrieved the [[Path engine]] from inside the ship.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 29" />

[[File:NoSpace-2020StarWars29.png|thumb|200px|Skywalker and his companions arrive in No-Space]]
Later, back at Holdo's friend's house, Holdo explained that she was planning to go after the [[Kezarat Convoy|''Kezarat'' convoy]], which Organa had suspected. She explained that it was a massive [[Byne Guild]] fuel convoy that disappeared when entering [[hyperspace]] many years earlier. Skywalker asked if it was because it got hit by raiders because it was such a sought-after target, but Holdo revealed it actually disappeared during a [[Great Hyperspace Disaster|storm]] in hyperspace caused by the Nihil. She hoped that the last message sent by the convoy that was thought to be nonsense was actually navigational data designed only to communicate with a Path engine and that both together could take them to the convoy. After Wookiee Guide finished installing the Path engine into their ship the ''[[Skyfarer]]'', a group of TIE fighters found them and started going after them. Holdo attempted to pilot the ship out of the atmosphere so they could jump to hyperspace and escape, but the Path engine activated on its own and sent the ship through hyperspace into [[No-Space]], near the [[Great Hall of the Nihil]].<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 29" />

=====The lost colony=====
{{Quote|Sometimes people find their way to No-Space, just like you all did. [&hellip;] One of those was a Jedi. Alareen Xie. She joined us, helped us fight off the Nihil. We wouldn't have survived without her. She died in time, as most people do. But after she did, a sort of belief rose up. That someday a Jedi would return and take us out of this place. Would take us home.|Blythe, to Skywalker|<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 31">[[Star Wars (2020) 31|''Star Wars'' (2020) 31]]</ref>}}
Skywalker and his friends did not recognize No-Space and had no idea where they were, but Skywalker expressed that while he had not traveled as much as they had, he knew the galaxy had strange things in it. He added that the Force seemed off and distant, as if there was not much around that was alive. After Holdo tried and failed to take the ship to hyperspace again, Skywalker suggested that they needed to disconnect the Path engine to see if it would fix the problem, but Holdo revealed they would need to land somewhere first. After landing on the Great Hall, Lando lamented the dangers of falling off the edge there and said it was worse than Cloud City, but Skywalker insisted that Cloud City had been really bad. A child in a spacesuit then appeared and asked them if they had 'flavors', which Calrissian interpreted to mean the kid wanted to eat them. Skywalker said he was just a kid, but Calrissian asked him to remind him to tell Skywalker about the [[White Worms]] gang's savage children. The kid eventually advised them to hide and ran off, and Skywalker sensed with the Force that the kid was terrified and did not know where he was going. The kid then jumped off the edge of the Hall, which shocked Skywalker, but he just activated a jetpack and flew away.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 30">[[Star Wars (2020) 30|''Star Wars'' (2020) 30]]</ref>

[[File:Killdroid-2020StarWars30.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A killdroid in the Great Hall]]
Lando suggested they get out of there, which Skywalker agreed with, suggesting they go back to their ship and try to find the other place there that the boy mentioned. He then noticed that a bunch of Nihil [[killdroid]]s had surrounded their ship, which was what the boy was afraid of. Skywalker began to fight them with his lightsaber, but quickly realized that they were lightsaber resistant. A ship then pulled up next to the hall, and Holdo suggested that they board it to escape the droids, but was concerned by having to jump across open space to it. Skywalker insisted that it was not that bad of a jump and because the ramp had a magnetic shield they would not be in the vacuum very long, but Calrissian implied that easy for him to say because he was a Jedi. They all jumped over to the ship without issue, except for Calrissian, who tripped and fell, prompting Skywalker to use the Force to pull him back up while muttering "I can do this." Once Calrissian was safe he thanked Skywalker for saving his life and assured him he would not bother him about studying his book ever again. Skywalker revealed that he could have gotten him to safety faster but could not because there was still something going on with the Force that he described as ripples messing with his concentration. Once the ship they were on docked with a larger ship, a voice over a speaker ordered them to throw their weapons out into space or they would vent them out into space. Skywalker considered using his lightaber to just cut through the door into the bigger ship but realized they would just vent them anyway. He threw his lightsaber out into space, which he said hurt because they were hard to find, but the kid with the jetpack just flew over, picked it up, and ignited it before flying away, Skywalker warning him that he needed to be careful with it or he would hurt himself.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 30" />

The voice over the speaker welcomed them to the [[Colony of Kezarat]]. Holdo yelled that they just needed to go home, but an [[Abyssin]] left the cockpit and told them they were home.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 30" /> After Organa said they would not attack and were listening, the individual introduced himself as Captain [[Blythe]], and Holdo introduced herself, Skywalker, and the others to him. Blythe then began a tour of the colony, confirming that it was the old convoy and the fuel was still there. The kid, who Blythe revealed was named [[Forvan]], then ran up excitedly, and Blythe explained that he had gotten excited from seeing a lightsaber. Skywalker asked if it was because they had Jedi there and asked for his saber back, but Blythe said they did not have Jedi there and he would get his lightsaber back in due time. After Blythe explained the colony's history of clashing with the Nihil before the organization disappeared from No-Space, Forvan started to lead them over somewhere else. Blythe told Skywalker to let Forvan down easy, and when he said he did not understand, Blythe said he would.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 31" />

[[File:AlareenXie-2020StarWars31.png|thumb|250px|The mural of Alareen Xie]]
Forvan took them to mural depicting a Jedi. Skywalker was shocked that they had a Jedi with the convoy, but Blythe said she had not been there from the beginning and just found her way to No-Space. Blythe explained that her name was [[Alareen Xie]], and that after she died a belief spread within the colony that a Jedi would someday lead them home. Blythe once again reiterated for Skywalker to let Forvan down easy, so he bent down to speak with Forvan and told him that while the Jedi could do incredible things, he could not assure them that he would get them out of No-Space, though he would at least do everything he could to try and get them out of there or to make their lives better. Forvan once again said that Jedi could do anything, so Skywalker just said he would try his best. After Blythe warned them that they would be there for a while and would not be able to get back to their ship, Skywalker and the others all went to sleeping quarters given to them. Skywalker paced around the room and Organa recognized something was wrong and asked him about it. Skywalker explained that he had to get out of there to get back to the ship to get the irreplaceable Jedi text that he had left on it. When she brought it up, Skywalker said he was not worried about his lightsaber as he could get another one, but that without the text he would not be able to move forward with his training. He feared that if he lost it and was no longer able to access its knowledge, techniques, and history of the Force and the Jedi Order or be able to use it to find places he could learn more, he would never truly become a Jedi.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 31" />

=====Escape from No-Space=====
{{Quote|Keep the killdroids off Chewie until he's back on the ship. Then get yourselves safe too. I'm going after the Jedi text.''"<br />"''But you said your saber can't get through [the killdroids'] armor! And Mark Tano&hellip;it's just a book!''"<br />"''No. It's ''the'' book. And as far as my lightsaber, I wasn't properly focused before. Now I am. Now&hellip;the Force is with me.|Skywalker and Holdo|<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 32">[[Star Wars (2020) 32|''Star Wars'' (2020) 32]]</ref>}}
After Wookiee Guide realized that they could use the Path engine to escape No-Space, Blythe gathered Skywalker and the others, offering them an old [[Longbeam-class corvette|Longbeam cruiser]] to retrieve it. Skywalker was skeptical that it could fly, but Blythe assured them that it used to and just needed to be fixed up. Once they got the cruiser to take off and leave the colony, Holdo and Lando took inventory of what they had, including that they had a Jedi. Skywalker reminded them that his connection to the Force was different and hard to use in No-Space and something strange felt like it was happening to it anyway, but he assured them he would try his best. Calrissian assured them they would be fine, but Skywalker was still skeptical and pointed out that the killdroids had found and taken the Path engine. Skywalker decided that he would distract the droids so the others could get the engine, but after needed to go back to the ''Skyfarer'' and get his Jedi text, refusing to leave without it. He added that he had talked to Forvan before they left and that the boy, wanting to help out a Jedi, gave him specialized gear, including a spacesuit, that he could use to get down to the Great Hall. Wearing the spacesuit, Skywalker jumped from the cruiser down to the Hall, ignited his lightsaber, and called out to the droids, encouraging them to go after him. As Skywalker, Holdo, and Calrissian distracted the droids, Skywalker deflecting their blastershots with his lightsaber, Wookiee Guide went after the engine. However, some droids noticed and went after Wookiee Guide anyway, so Skywalker sent them flying away off into no-Space with the Force. He warned Wookiee Guide that he probably would not be able to do it again, so he needed to run and get the engine back to the ship.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 32" />

[[File:ColonyofKezarat-CGSWG.png|thumb|left|250px|The Kezarat Colony]]
After shooting a droid behind Wookiee Guide with a blaster, Skywalker started to run off and told Holdo to keep Wookiee Guide safe while he ran after the Jedi text. She reminded him that his lightsaber could not get through their armor and that it was just a book, but Skywalker said that it was more than just a book and that he had not been focused when his lightsaber would not cut them the first time, but now was. Skywalker sliced through the droids with his lightsaber while saying "the Force is with me" and calling out for what they did with his book. He eventually found the book on a ledge at the edge of the Hall and decided that he would easily be able to grab it and fly back to the ship, but a killdroid shot his jetpack, sending him flying uncontrollably toward the book and leaving it without fuel. As killdroids approached him, their footsteps shaking the ground caused the book to go over the edge. Skywalker screamed in horror and reached out to it with his right hand, which was holding his lightsaber, but a droid grabbed his hand and lifted him up by it, crushing both his hand and his lightsaber.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 32" /> The droid threw him onto the ground and into the remains of the ''Skyfarer'', and Skywalker cried out in horror when he saw his hand and lightsaber. Calrissian and Holdo saw what happened and decided to try and get to Skywalker before the droids killed him. A delirious Skywalker told the approaching droids to stop, but when they did not, he threw all of the droids out of the Hall in a massive wave using the Force while telling himself "may the Force be with me." Calrissian, Holdo, and Wookiee Guide were shocked at how he was doing it, and Calrissian told Wookiee Guide to remind him never to get on his bad side. Skywalker then pulled the Jedi text to him with the Force and passed out immediately after.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 33">[[Star Wars (2020) 33|''Star Wars'' (2020) 33]]</ref>

Later, on the way back to the colony, Calrissian checked in on a now handless Skywalker, though the droid had only destroyed his already mechanical hand. Calrissian asked him how he would done what he did, but he said that he did not understand how it happened and that it felt like the Force suddenly came back to him stronger than ever, and that it was frightening. Calrissian told him to cheer up, but thinking about his broken lightsaber and his inevitable confrontation with Vader, told Calrissian that he was not sure he would be able to do something he needed to anymore. Back at the colony, Skywalker showed Organa, who had stayed behind, what happened to his hand. Blythe and Forvan offered to fix it up, the latter suggesting a claw or grappling hook, but Skywalker said he would just wait until they got home even though those things would be cool. Skywalker and Wookiee Guide then presented the Path engine to Blythe. After Blythe presented the group to the members of the colony, but Organa and Calrissian warned them about the dangers of the Empire and traveling with them, Blythe revealed to them that several of the colony decided to go back with them. However, he revealed that many were going to stay on the Great Hall since they got rid of all the killdroids. Wookiee Guide pointed out that Skywalker got rid of all the droids by himself, and Blythe commented that it seemed the things people said about Jedi were true. However, Skywalker, who was struggling to pull a piece of scrap to him with the Force, said they sometimes were true and sometimes were not. Later, after a rough hyperspace jump made with many ships secured together and assisted by Lobot, Skywalker and his friends as well as several members of the colony arrived back in the greater galaxy.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 33" />

Back with the fleet, Skywalker had his mechanical hand repaired by a medical droid while Unit7 did his best to repair his lightsaber. Organa reminded Skywalker that it could have been worse if the droid had crushed his other hand, and asked him about the powerful act of the Force he had pulled off on the Great Hall. He confirmed that he had not learned it from his book but that it was instead related to something being wrong with the Force, describing it as if something hit the Force while he was in No-Space and caused it to ripple. He added that it felt like waves on the beach in the way that it vacillated from him being the strongest he had ever been where he almost could not control it, to not being able to feel it at all. Organa then wondered if since he could feel it, and even she could slightly, that the Emperor and Vader were also feeling it immensely and were distracted, making it their chance to defeat them. Skywalker said her theory made sense, and she went to speak with Mon Mothma. Skywalker thanked R2 for attempting to fix his lightsaber, but admitted that he was going to need a new one for when he inevitably faced Vader again.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 33" />

====Duel with a droid====
{{Quote|A Jedi&hellip;I was afraid my dreams of killing one were dashed. [&hellip;] I'd been informed the Jedi were extinct.''"<br />"''Oh, don't worry&hellip;they still are.|Ajax Sigma and Skywalker|<ref name="Revelations 1">[[Revelations (2022) 1|''Revelations'' (2022) 1]]</ref>}}
[[File:AjaxSigma-Revelations2022.png|thumb|250px|Ajax Sigma]]
While still escorting more of the ''Kezarat'' convoy to the Alliance fleet, Skywalker felt a disturbance in the Force while on the ''Millennium Falcon''. He explained to Organa that it was not like the one he had felt in No-Space but instead felt like the deaths of innocent people, and that it was nearby enough that he could bring them there. Organa agreed to go despite the fact they were supposed to be escorting the convoy. When they arrived, Protocol Droid revealed that the moon did not appear on any [[Star map|star-charts]]. Organa wondered if it was erased by the Empire, but Skywalker said it was not and pointed out an ancient lightsaber like none he would ever seen before. He and Wookiee Guide then noticed that there was a large amount of destroyed droids that were cut down with a lightsaber. They all realized that a battle had been fought there, and Skywalker put together that it had been between droids and people, and since there were no battle droids and no remains, it must have been hundreds of years earlier. Skywalker realized that the battle was not what he had sensed and instead lead them to a [[homesteader ship]] that they found to be full of bodies. Protocol Droid offered to secure the ''Falcon'' but Skywalker said it was not necessary. Skywalker asked R2 to plug into the ship and see if it had any information about the moon they were on. R2 revealed it was called [[Kligson's Moon]]. Skywalker suggested that the carnage there may have recently happened and the perpetrator could still be there, and suggested splitting up into pairs to search due to the size of the ship.<ref name="Revelations 1" />

After discovering a droid, that unbeknownst to Skywalker was [[Ajax Sigma]], an ancient droid revolutionary, he asked it why they killed all the people there. Sigma claimed that it was self defense and that they attacked him outside when he came there to retrieve something, but Skywalker did not believe him. The droid clarified that he had followed the people back to their ship and killed them all, which Skywalker said did not sound like self-defense. The droid activated electric blades on his arms and disparaged Skywalker for being organic and for suggesting that the droid would go with him and answer for his actions. Skywalker ignited his lightsaber and began to fight Sigma, who used the blades on his arms to defend himself. He was surprised to see a Jedi, believing them all to be dead, and Skywalker assured him they were. After Skywalker sliced open the droid's chest and knocked him down, he ordered him to stand down or face destruction. However, the droid just entered a pod that he ejected from the homesteader ship, successfully escaping.<ref name="Revelations 1" />

Vader had a vision of Skywalker and Sigma's duel while speaking with the [[Eye of Webbish Bog]], sometime before the events of No-Space and the activation of the Fermata Cage. In the vision, Vader also saw Skywalker holding two kyber crystals, one green and one red.<ref name="Revelations 1" />

Because he had lost control of his powers just as Skywalker had, Vader recruited Doctor Aphra to help him find a way to control them. While in a shuttle to a location she had in mind, Aphra walked into a room where Vader was meditating and entered a vision he was having that included Skywalker in his Tatooine farm boy clothes. Aphra did not understand why Skywalker was there and did not recognize the other individual in the vision, [[Sabé]], who was telling Skywalker that there was still good in Vader, which were Skywalker's mother's last words.<ref name="Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 35">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2020) 35|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2020) 35]]</ref>

[[File:AphraKidnapsMark Tano-2020DoctorAphra31.png|thumb|left|250px|Doctor Aphra kidnaps Skywalker on Numidian Prime.]]
Though his lightsaber was still not fixed, Skywalker traveled to [[Numidian Prime]] with Unit7 in search of a [[Unidentified temple (Numidian Prime)|temple]] on the planet. He briefly left R2 in a temporary camp while he searched for it, but after finding no sign of it and it started to rain he returned to the camp, finding peace in the solitude. He apologized to R2 for leaving, saying they needed to wait for the rain to taper off, but then noticed the droid was deactivated and laying on the ground. He cried out and ran to the droid, but a node underneath the droid started shooting smoke out, confusing Skywalker and knocking him out after he inhaled it. The trap had been set by Doctor Chelli Aphra, who then stood over an unconscious Skywalker and greeted him, calling him a "farm boy", and asked how he felt about going on an adventure.<ref name="Aphra 2020 31">[[Doctor Aphra (2020) 31|''Doctor Aphra'' (2020) 31]]</ref>

Aphra eventually bound and gagged Skywalker and placed him in a crate on her ship the ''[[Ark Angel IV]]''. When he woke up, she opened the crate and said she was glad he was still breathing before offering him [[Caf]]. She started to get him some as he realized who kidnapped him, telling her he did not want Caf and just wanted to know why she did it and what she had done with R2. She explained that she had put a restraining bolt on and turned off R2, and Skywalker realized that she needed him for something. Aphra then claimed that she was going to actually do him a huge favor. Skywalker had managed to slip out of the ropes she had tied him up in, which she noticed at that moment, surprised at how quickly he had done it and wondering if Solo had taught him as she presented a holorecording. Realizing it was a Jedi holo, Skywalker listened as Jedi Master [[Shaak Ti]] explained to [[Aayla Secura]] that a powerful Jedi artifact called [[Kythoo's Bell]] was locked away at the [[Sason Temple]]. Aphra told him that she knew how to get there an needed a Jedi to get in, but Skywalker was still suspicious. After insisting she was just being nice and trying to make up for the events at the Screaming Citadel, Aphra pointed out that the artifact could give Skywalker an edge over Vader. After contemplating it more, Skywalker asked her how far [[Sason]] was, exciting her.<ref name="Aphra 2020 32" />

=====Sason Temple=====
{{Quote|Right before I found you, Vader found me. That 'Force pulse' you felt? He felt it too. But unlike you, it just made him stronger. Wild. Out of control. You don't stand a chance against him as you are. Say we leave Sason without Kythoo's Bell. Vader kills everyone you care about to get to you. Then he kills you. Once you're dead, who's going to protect me from him?|Chelli Aphra to Skywalker|<ref name="Aphra 2020 33">[[Doctor Aphra (2020) 33|''Doctor Aphra'' (2020) 33]]</ref>}}
[[File:SasonTemple-2020DoctorAphra32.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Sason Temple]]
As they flew into Sason in the ''Ark Angel IV'', Skywalker noticed that their navigation systems went offline, which Aphra attributed to the planet's [[magnetic storm]]. Telling Aphra she had a great copilot, Skywalker navigated the ship through the storm despite Aphra's protests, following an echo of a note he could hear in the Force and urging Aphra to trust him. They then flew toward a gap in the storm that held the temple, Skywalker exclaiming that it was beautiful. After being briefly confused by Aphra calling the temple their payday, which she insisted was figurative, Aphra explained that her research claimed that the temple would only open to someone who was pure of heart and strong in the Force. Skywalker tried to open it but failed, explaining to Aphra that he was unable to use the Force because something was happening to it making it unstable. Aphra then accused him of making things up to navigate them there, but he insisted he had used the Force. Realizing they did not have any other options, Aphra asked him if he had learned anything tricks at Jedi school, but Skywalker only said Jedi school did not exist anymore.<ref name="Aphra 2020 32" />

A massive guardian made out of crystal then formed, Skywalker telling R2 to get behind him and trying and failing to ignite his broken lightsaber. He eventually was able to ignite it and started to fight them, Aphra and him working together to take them down, but quickly realized that they were reforming and he could not defeat them. When his lightsaber deactivated, Skywalker reached out to the Force, destroying the guardians with a massive Force push while Aphra destroyed the [[Magnetic wave emitter]] that was causing them to reform. Skywalker felt like he was going to pass out, but just them the floor collapsed under them and dropped them into a pool. Skywalker called out for R2, who had not landed in the pool, but Aphra assured Skywalker the droid was fine. The two then noticed the figures of Jedi Masters Shaak Ti and Aayla Secura standing in front of them.<ref name="Aphra 2020 32" />

[[File:KythoosBell-2020DoctorAphra33.png|thumb|left|200px|Kythoo's Bell]]
Skywalker attempted to introduce himself to the Masters, but Aphra quickly realized that they were advanced holograms. This disappointed Skywalker, who had briefly believed he was not alone as a Jedi. As they traversed the temple, illusions started to make the two believe the other was saying things they were not, leading to Skywalker lashing out at Aphra for always treating things like a joke and questioning her on why she was not using her electro-tattoos, and Aphra believing Skywalker had referenced her and Sana Starros' breakup, though in reality, Skywalker had no idea that they had been in a relationship. As the argument reached its peak as Aphra asked him how he broke his lightsaber, a creature slammed onto the other side of the crystal wall, terrifying the two, but after Kythoo's bell rang it retreated. After hurriedly leaving to another section of the temple, Skywalker began to realize that the entire place was made up of illusions after almost falling into a pit of spikes. He suggested that things felt wrong and they should leave, but Aphra held a gun to his head to stop him and revealed that she was trying to make Skywalker more powerful because Vader had become more powerful, and she wanted Skywalker to protect her from the Sith Lord. Skywalker agreed and convinced her to put her blaster down, the two using Skywalker's ability to sense the bell with the Force and Aphra's ability to take down the traps, obstacles, and guardians in their way to eventually locate the bell.<ref name="Aphra 2020 33" />

=====Starweird=====
{{Quote|If you die, this whole trip was ''useless!'' If you fall, I'm ''keeping'' your laser sword. That's my blaster!''"<br />"''If ''you'' die, I'm keeping it!|Aphra and Skywalker, while fighting the Starweird|<ref name="Aphra 2020 34">[[Doctor Aphra (2020) 34|''Doctor Aphra'' (2020) 34]]</ref>}}
Realizing the bell was to big to transport, and having no Force-ritual to use with it, Aphra removed a piece inside of the bell by standing on Skywalker's shoulders and grabbing it. However, this caused the entire bell to collapse and be destroyed, which Skywalker realized made the echo of the note he could hear stop resonating throughout the Temple. Just then, the creature they had seen earlier burst through the wall, and Aphra realized that Sason Temple was really a Jedi prison.<ref name="Aphra 2020 33" /> Aphra recognized the creature as a [[Starweird]], a species that was supposed to be extinct. The Starweird threw them onto the wall telekinetically, but Skywalker recognized that it was not using the Force. When Aphra accidentally activated the piece of the bell they had retrieved and thus Forced the creature to be frozen, she realized it was an emitter releasing a frequency that affected the Starweird. However, the emitter deactivated and the Starweird flew toward Aphra, so Skywalker used the Force to impale it with a bunch of crystals before he and Aphra ran away. Skywalker admitted that he had not been trying to impale it, just hold it still as he led Aphra through the temple. After Skywalker, decided to hide in a room full of mirrors, Aphra called him brilliant.<ref name="Aphra 2020 34" />

[[File:Starweird-2020DoctorAphra33.png|thumb|right|250px|Skywalker and Aphra face a Starweird.]]
As Skywalker used the Force to manipulate the reflections of the crystals to lure the Starweird toward them, Aphra used her electro-tattoos to activate the holograms of Masters Ti and Secura. Skywalker, Aphra, and Unit7 were able to flee the creature and its scream while it was distracted. However, the creature found them, knocking Skywalker to the edge of the temple and leaving him barely hanging on. While proclaiming her desperation to protect Skywalker, she fought the Starweird using his lightsaber. Skywalker eventually pulled himself up and shot at the creature, saying he would keep it if she died right before Aphra sliced the creature's hand off, which Skywalker commented did not feel good. Escaping into the ''Ark Angel IV'', but with the Starweird still on their tail, Skywalker directed Aphra to lead them into the magnetic storm and used the Force to activate the emitter, knocking the creature into the storm and eviscerating it, and leaving him surprised at his ability.<ref name="Aphra 2020 34" />

Later, back on Numidian Prime, Skywalker told Aphra she did not need to trick or bribe him into protecting her from Vader, insisting he would help because it was the the Jedi way. Aphra warned against his kindness, but Skywalker declared he preferred to take the chance than close himself off from people in need and leave himself all alone. Aphra told him to call her the next time he needed to get into a Jedi tomb, but Skywalker said he would not and took off in his X-wing, having taken the emitter with him before Aphra could realize.<ref name="Aphra 2020 34" />

====Christophsis====
{{Quote|Every time I think I have a handle on being a Jedi, something happens to kick me back. The ground under my feet just disappears&hellip; I'm going to have to face Vader again, and I am not ready. I don't even have a lightsaber I can rely on.|Skywalker to Organa|<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 34">[[Star Wars (2020) 34|''Star Wars'' (2020) 34]]</ref>}}
While studying his Jedi text and the yellow kyber crystal from his lightsaber on the ''Home One'', Skywalker realized that he did not know a lot about kyber crystals except them being in every lightsaber as their power source. He explained to Unit7 that the text only contained details about the philosophy and spirituality of kyber crystals and an old rite of passage for younglings to find a crystal to make their first lightsaber on the planet Ilum, referring to another manual by Professor [[Huyang]] for building instructions. He figured that Zenon and Kenobi had never taught him anything about them because he had already had one, but lamented that his had never had a connection with him like they were supposed to due to the almost living nature of the crystals. He ignited his lightsaber and said that now that the crystal was cracked it no longer was a useful tool and was unstable. Due to the saber's unsteadiness, R2 made a concerned beep and Skywalker shut it off and apologized. Realizing that he needed a new crystal, Skywalker decided that he and R2 should visit other worlds the text mentioned to find them since Ilum was locked down by the Empire. Just then, Organa walked in. After he told he was going somewhere, she expressed her concern for him especially due to the strangeness of the Force as well as her desire for him to stay and help the Alliance. Skywalker insisted he was fine, saying he was just troubled by not knowing why the Force was strange or how to fix his lightsaber and felt like he could never truly get a handle on being a Jedi. He also admitted that he needed a lightsaber for his confrontation with Vader, and that he felt like he needed to go on this mission in order to take control and take action.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 34">[[Star Wars (2020) 34|''Star Wars'' (2020) 34]]</ref>

[[File:Christophsis.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Christophsis]]
Skywalker chose to go to Christophsis, due to the fact that there was not much of a permanent Citadel Palace presence there despite it being an Citadel Palace world and because the text said kyber crystals could regularly be found there. He flew his X-Wing there with R2 and landed outside of a small mining town where prospectors sell their finds so he would not get noticed, though did not want to have to walk the way there. R2 indicated to him that he wanted to know the plan, so Skywalker admitted that he did not have one. He explained that Calrissian had told him there was a black market for crystals on Christophsis because prospectors try to sell them since there was not enough for the Empire to set up a full-scale mining operation. He told R2 that he just planned to put the word out and pose as a buyer to see who would speak with him. He admitted that it was not much of a plan but gave R2 his lightsaber to hold onto while he looked around, not wanting to make it obvious he was a Jedi. He assured R2 he would be fine and told the droid that he could save him if he got into trouble. He then started in to a nearby cantina.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 34" />

[[File:Gretta-2020StarWars34.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gretta]]
In the cantina, Skywalker got food and water and implied to an [[Unidentified Iktotchi bartender|Iktotchi bartender]] that he was a wealthy buyer looking for kyber. Just as the Iktotchi was offering to point Skywalker to his quarry, a human with green hair shot and killed him and everyone else in the cantina except for Skywalker, leaving him shocked. She taunted him and called him by name, so Skywalker used the Force to pull his lightsaber to him from R2, who had just rolled in and ordered her to explain herself. She introduced herself as [[Gretta]] and claimed that she saved his life, pointing out a blaster behind the counter. She explained that the whole place was ploy to trap people looking for kyber and sell them to the Empire, and that she saved him from it because he was a Jedi. She claimed that she still believed and recognized him from the dark channels, having posted out there in case any Jedi came through. She told him that there was kyber near and told him that she had to kill the people there because she knew he would not. Skywalker was still upset that she killed everyone there, insisting they died for nothing and urging her to live a better life before leaving. Skywalker went off to look for crystals on the planet, sensing she had told the truth about there being some there, but she called after him and told him he was going the wrong direction. He saw she had a speeder with her and urged him to let her help him, explaining that she was from Jedha and that her people were the [[Fallanassi]]. She revealed that they were killed by the Death Star, and that when Skywalker had destroyed it he had avenged them, and thus she wanted to return the favor. Skywalker told R2 to go back to the ship and tell the others where he was if he did not come back in a day, assuring the droid he would be okay and that he needed to do this while getting in Gretta's speeder.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 34" />

On the way, Skywalker asked Gretta about the Fallanassi. She explained that they did not use kyber crystals and had not been Force-sensitive for many years, only understanding it, not using it. When he asked, she also revealed that they were going to meet a man named [[Cuata]] who had hid there to escape the eye of the Empire and continue his studies, having been sought out by the Citadel Palaces to help design the weapon. Skywalker was confused about how she knew this information, and she explained that she has been working for him. Suddenly, a massive creature emerged from the gournd and knocked Skywalker and Gretta off of the speeder. Skywalker ignited his lightsaber and told Gretta to run, but she was delirious and urged him to fight the creature. Noticing the instability of his lightsaber, he decided just to run as the creature crushed their speeder with its mouth. The creature pursued them closely, so Skywalker just told Gretta to run, intending to use the Force to calm the creature. However, when he tried to he found himself unable to touch the Force. The creature nearly reached him until a massive explosion rocked him and Cuata emerged from the smoke and dust, instantly asking Skywalker if he could have his lightsaber.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 34" />

====The kyber crystals====
=====Red=====
{{Quote|You came here to heal me&mdash;but what if do not ''want'' to be healed? I am not ''sick'', young master. Your ministrations would to me, be a form of ''violence''. ''You'' have experienced violence, I think. ''You'' have experienced pain. We can use it&hellip;''together''.|The Sith in the crystal, to Skywalker|<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 35" />}}
[[File:StarWars2020-35-NotoVariant-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Mark Tano shows his lightsaber to Cuata.]]
Realizing he came on too strong, Cuata explained that the kyber crystals he wore around his neck told him that Skywalker needed help. Gretta introduced Skywalker to Cuata, and though he was initially concerned that the doctor thought the crystals were talking to him, apologized and asked for his help with his broken lightsaber after Gretta assured Skywalker he could trust Cuata. He immediately took the lightsaber and started tinkering with it, quickly discovering that the crystal was cracked and assured him he could fix it if Skywalker did something for him first. Cuata also revealed Skywalker's crystal told him that he was having trouble with the Force, and then started to lead him to his workshop.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 35" />

At Cuata's workshop, Skywalker explained that he had found his lightsaber and that he and his R2 unit had worked on it. Cuata, concerned at Skywalker's lack of knowledge, explained the components and inner workings of a lightsaber and told Skywalker that a lightsaber's wielder should have a strong connection with its crystal, something Skywalker admitted he had never felt, not even with his father's lightsaber. While Cuata worked on fixing the lightsaber, he gave Skywalker a red kyber crystal and asked him to pull the dark side out of it. Gretta, whose people had a history with healing crystals, explained how crystals were turned red by [[bleeding]] them with the Dark side, but could be healed afterward, though the process of doing so could change people and forced them to connect with whoever bled it.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 35" />

[[File:GolsCourt-2020StarWars35.png|thumb|250px|Skywalker has a vision of a Sith lord in a Sith hall]]
Skywalker agreed to try, and when he reached out to the crystal with the Force, suddenly found himself in a massive Sith hall in front of a [[Gol (Sith)|Sith lord]] sitting on a throne. The Sith greeted him and Skywalker explained his intentions of healing the crystal, but the Sith said they did not want to be healed so attempting to do so would be violence toward them. The Sith grabbed and twisted Skywalker's hand and said that together they could use the violence and the pain he had experienced. After a flash of light from his hand, the vision changed, putting Skywalker in a spirit-like version of his body facing his father's [[Fortress Vader]] on Mustafar. Vader then appeared on it and Skywalker ignited the red lightsaber in his hand, but a wave of red light washed over him and the vision ended.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 35" />

[[File:Zenon-2020StarWars35.png|thumb|left|250px|Zenon appears to Skywalker inside the raw kyber crystal.]]
A terrified Skywalker stared at the still-red crystal and told Cuata that he had seen his father. Cuata then asked Skywalker to connect with a clear and raw kyber crystal, assuring him that he would pull him out if his crystals told him the Force was receding. After reaching out to the crystal, Skywalker found himself standing in front of Zenon. He believed it was not real, but still asked Zenon why he never answered when he reached out to him with the Force especially since he was hurt and trying to learn. Zenon insisted that all Jedi need to walk their own Path and that he would have returned to him otherwise. Zenon warned that Skywalker would need to make a decision about himself soon. Skywalker decided that he was not getting anything from speaking to Zenon and that he would be better off just learning from his Jedi text. He tried to leave the vision but could not, realizing that the Force had pulled back from him as it had been recently. Zenon told Skywalker that it was not really gone even when it was out of sight, waved his hand, and sent Skywalker out of the vision, wishing him goodbye. Zenon, who had been really speaking to Skywalker the whole time, asked the spirit of Kenobi what he thought. They both agreed that he was still not ready, but Zenon pointed out that he had learned much and would be ready when the time came.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 35" />

When Skywalker exited the vision, he discovered that the clear kyber crystal had turned green. Cuata gave him his saber back, having temporarily fixed it, but Gretta revealed that the scientist had been willing to let Skywalker stay trapped in the crystal and even die, advising him not to tell Cuata anything. Skywalker thanked Cuata for fixing his lightsaber and told him that he would take the green crystal for when he needed to build his own saber, also taking the red one in case one day he could heal it. Back at his X-Wing, Skywalker thanked Gretta for helping him and said he had learned despite things not going the way he had thought. He said he would go back to the Alliance eventually as his biggest battles still lay ahead, but revealed that he was going to spend time thinking first while holding up both the red and green crystal with the Force.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 35" />

While he was away, Organa used the intel Skywalker gave her that the Emperor and Vader were distracted by a Force anomaly to launch an [[Assault on World Prime|aerial assault on World Prime]], successfully destroying a statue of Palpatine in the hopes of inspiring rebellion across the galaxy.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 36">[[Star Wars (2020) 36|''Star Wars'' (2020) 36]]</ref>

====Dark droids====

[[File:SacredJediText-DarkDroids1.png|thumb|right|300px|Skywalker studies his Jedi text with Unit7.]]
When studying his Jedi text, he found a reference to a Jedi outpost in the [[Tammuz sector]]. After seeing nothing on a map Unit7 pulled up for him, however, he decided that there was probably nothing there but that they could swing by if they got the chance. Later, as the [[Scourge crisis|Scourge of the droids]] began across the galaxy, Skywalker was in a meeting with Rebellion higher-ups concerning how to handle the new Death Star. Commodore Grek suggested they just threw Skywalker at it again, but Skywalker suspected it might take more than him in an X-wing to take down the new station.<ref name="Dark Droids 1">[[Dark Droids 1|''Dark Droids'' 1]]</ref>

Later, while Skywalker was meditating and practicing telekinesis, he was approached by Protocol Droid, who had been infected by the malevolent droid entity called the [[Scourge]] that was behind the scourge of the droids. The Scourge, as Protocol Droid questioned Skywalker on the nature of the Force and if droids could use it. Skywalker explained that he had never heard of that happening but thought it could potentially be possible. When the Scourge then asked if Skywalker's cybernetic arm felt connected to the Force, he explained that his whole being felt connected, but that he was not a true cyborg like Chancellor Valorum Vader. Skywalker expressed his concern that something was wrong with Protocol Droid, leading to the Scourge briefly considering killing him. Instead, the droid just apologised and agreed to get a diagnostic, before agreeing to Skywalker's request to send Unit7 his way.<ref name="Dark Droids 2">[[Dark Droids 2|''Dark Droids'' 2]]</ref>

As the scourge of the droids continued, Calrissian recruited Skywalker and Organa for a mission to the planet [[Epikonia]] to rescue Lobot, who had been infected by the Scourge. When they arrived in the ''Millennium Falcon'', Skywalker was unsure what made the world special until Organa explained that it was a communications hub. Calrissian then refused to allow Skywalker to access transpoder signals and turned off the ''Falcon''{{'s}} navigation systems to prevent the infection from reaching the ship's [[L3-37|droid core]]. Skywalker and Organa were concerned, but Calrissian managed to land them safely on a satelite dish. The Scourge soon learned that Skywalker was on the planet and became obsessed with the idea of infecting him so that it could use the Force.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 40">[[Star Wars (2020) 40|''Star Wars'' (2020) 40]]</ref>

[[File:StarWars-Vol-7-Solicit-Cover.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker, Organa, Calrissian, and Wookiee Guide fight the Scourge on Epikonia.]]
As the group traversed through the planet's main city where the Scourge was headquartered, Skywalker noticed that there were no people around. They were then [[Battle on Epikonia|attacked]] by a horde of violent Scourge-infected droids, Skywalker using his yellow lightsaber to begin taking them down alongside his friends.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 40" /> Skywalker sliced through the ever-growing mob of droids while urging himself to stay calm, focused, and concentrated on the Force. When the droids ominously and suddenly retreated, a new swarm of [[spider-droid]]s attacked. Skywalker tried to fight them off, but was quickly infected with the Scourge by one. As the Scourge was controlling Skywalker's body and declared itself the 'new Force' it was defeated by Ajax Sigma, freeing Skywalker from its control. Though unsure what happened, Skywalker went with the others to find Lobot. Once they did, Calrissian and Wookiee Guide started to take him back to the ship while Skywalker and Organa assisted people who had been experimented on by the Scourge.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 41" />

Skywalker and Organa returned to the ship very quickly, as they found themselves unable to assist a great amount. They discovered Calrissian with the [[Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II|Talky droid]] that contained much of the Alliance's secrets. As Organa and Calrissian threatened each other, Skywalker urged them to focus on healing Lobot. Calrissian then explained the circumstances that had led him to sell the droid, and thus the Alliance's secrets, to Jabba the Hutt, leaving Skywalker and Organa shocked.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 41" />

===The last of the Jedi===
====Zastiga====
{{Quote|Weapons and war don't make you a Jedi. I know that now.|Mark Tano|<ref name="Moving Target">''[[Moving Target: A Princess Aria Organa Adventure]]''</ref>}}
After the command of Red Squadron was transferred to Antilles following his promotion to squadron leader, which pleased Skywalker,<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> he declined to rejoin the squadron and chose to be stationed onboard the ''Redemption''. When he went to [[Zastiga]], he and Unit7 were the ones to greet Organa on her arrival to the planet after she and Protocol Droid left the ''[[Mellcrawler]]'', piloted by its owner [[Tennon]] and Lieutenant [[Caluan Ematt]]. When the time came for Organa to attend the top clearance meeting with the Rebel leadership, Skywalker and Nunb met with Antilles for a discussion of "reconnaissance tactics" about Antilles' refusal to pay the [[Sullustan]] a drink. He would later return to escort Organa to her quarters before going to his, and two days later, he saw her off, before catching his own shuttle back to the ''Redemption''.<ref name="Moving Target" />

Soon afterwards, he would go to [[Kothlis]], where he would learn of Solo's location—still frozen in carbonite and kept in Jabba the Hutt's palace—, and where he would keep himself up-to-date with the status of the Alliance Fleet's assembly. He had already devised a plan to rescue Solo when Organa contacted him following the successful [[Operation Amber Wing Moon]], and showed eagerness to join him on his attempts to [[Rescue of Rhade Tan|rescue]] the Trade Core smuggler.<ref name="Moving Target" />

====Citadel Palace Refining Platform M36====
{{Quote|We just took an ''Citadel Palace refinery'' without a ''scratch''-- all thanks to ''Skywalker''. I heard the stories. But I never saw anyone swing a ''lightsaber'' up close like that.|a Pau'an Rebel Major about Mark Tano|<ref name="Age of Rebellion - Mark Tano">[[Age of Rebellion - Mark Tano 1|''Age of Rebellion - Mark Tano'' 1]]</ref>}}
[[File:RaidAtCitadel PalaceRefiningPlatformM36-AORMark Tano1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mark Tano during the raid at Citadel Palace Refining Platform M36.]]
Sometime before the rescue of Solo, Skywalker took part in a [[Raid at Citadel Palace Refining Platform M36|raid]] on [[Citadel Palace Refining Platform M36]]. During the raid, Skywalker used [[Mark Tano's green lightsaber|his new lightsaber]], along with his Force abilities, to clear a path for Rebel forces to acquire copious Citadel Palace fuel stores. His Rebel companions became awed at his use, although one of them, the [[Unidentified Rebel major (Pau'an)|major]] in charge of the operation, held reservations about its power as he had only previously seen such power being wielded by the Sith. Unknown to Skywalker, the Emperor had begun to probe his mental defenses from afar, which caused Skywalker to briefly open his saber in alarm.<ref name="Age of Rebellion - Mark Tano" />

As Skywalker and the strike team flew away from the platform, they were ambushed by an Citadel Palace Star Destroyer, which launched several TIE Fighters in pursuit. As the battle began to rage, Skywalker's mind was penetrated by a vision from the Emperor. The vision saw Mark Tano follow a possible series of events wherein he would begrudgingly leave the Rebel strike team to its fate and crash-land on an unknown planet, losing his X-wing in the process. As he journeyed from the wreckage together with Unit7, Mark Tano would leave his lightsaber and helmet on the ground, symbolizing his complete retreat from the concerns of the war.<ref name="Age of Rebellion - Mark Tano" />

Having later broken free of the Emperor's vision, Skywalker proceeded to aid the Rebels in escaping the Citadel Palace ambush, using his lightsaber to prevent the major's shuttle from leaving, giving him time to pilot the shuttle and draw the Citadel Palaces away from the rest of the Rebels.<ref name="Age of Rebellion - Mark Tano" />

====Solo's rescue====
{{Quote|I am taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this or be destroyed. It's your choice, but I warn you not to underestimate my powers.|Mark Tano, to Jabba Desilijic Tiure|audio=IAmTakingCaptainSolo.flac|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:Mark Tanoonskiff.png|thumb|left|206x206px|Skywalker returned to Tatooine in order to rescue Solo from Jabba Desilijic Tiure.]]
In [[4 ABY]],<ref name="Stellar Conflict Atlas" /> Skywalker set in motion the plan to rescue Solo from Jabba the Hutt<ref name="Episode VI" /> due to their failure to do so during the [[Attack on the Executor|Attack on the ''Executor'']].<ref name="War of the Bounty Hunters 5" /> Once again, Skywalker returned to Tatooine, and to Kenobi's hut, wherein he found the missing parts he needed for the construction of his own lightsaber, the pieces left to him by Kenobi. While his friends bustled about preparing for the rescue, Skywalker retreated into the solitude of a desert cave they had chosen as their rendezvous point. Using the Force to assemble the weapon, he brought the kyber crystal inside to life, making the weapon his own, almost an extension of himself.<ref name="BtPotDS!" />

Afterward, Skywalker waited to see if Organa's impersonation of [[Boushh]] and liberation of Solo was successful without his intervention, but she was only half-successful. She then sent a message to Skywalker and Calrissian that she had been captured as well, prompting Skywalker to act and go to Jabba's Palace.<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> Skillful use of the Force allowed Skywalker to get past Jabba's [[Gamorrean]] guards and use a Jedi mind trick to get his [[majordomo]], [[Bib Fortuna]], to present him to the Hutt. However, Jabba was not so easily swayed by Skywalker and ignored both his demand to give him Solo and Wookiee Guide and Skywalker's warnings about underestimating him. Jabba laughed and dispatched Skywalker through a trap door where he was standing, dropping the young Jedi into a pit below, where the Hutt unleashed his massive [[rancor]] [[Pateesa]]. Skywalker struggled against the terrifying creature that tried to feast on him. But to the shock of Jabba and his thugs, Skywalker was able to kill the monster by dropping a large metal gate on its neck, upsetting [[Malakili]], the rancor's keeper. Jabba was furious and sentenced all the captured Alliance heroes&mdash;including an unfrozen Solo&mdash;to death in the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] to be eaten by the [[sarlacc]] that resided there.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Jabba's dancers, including [[Rystáll Sant]] and [[Lyn Me]], were ecstatic that Skywalker killed the beast and told [[musician]] [[Maximilian Rebo|Max Rebo]] about it, Me believing and fantasizing that he had done it to avenge [[Oola]], another dancer who had been fed to the creature, though dancer [[Greeata Jendowanian]] acknowledged that was not true.<ref name="Max Rebo">[[Return of the Jedi – Max Rebo 1|''Return of the Jedi – Max Rebo'' 1]]</ref>

Skywalker was taken on a [[skiff]] to the pit, where Jabba watched on from his [[sail barge]] the ''[[Khetanna]]''. Before he was walked out onto a plank above the mouth of the sarlacc, Skywalker yelled to Jabba, telling him that he had one last chance to free them and would die if he did not. Skywalker nodded to Calrissian, who was on the skiff, and then saluted to Unit7, who was on the ''Khetanna'', before jumping off the plank, grabbing onto it, and using as a springboard to flip back onto the skiff. Skywalker then escaped when Unit7 shot his lightsaber to him, allowing him to take down the guards and free the other prisoners on the [[skiff]]. A skirmish ensued in which Skywalker protected his friends, including facing and fending off Boba Fett, jumping over and onto the ''Khetanna'', ending the life of several of Jabba's thugs<ref name="Episode VI" />&mdash;including [[Klaatu]]<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> and [[Nysad]], who shot his cyborg hand during the skirmish&mdash; and helping Organa, who had killed the Hutt by strangling him, escape the ''Khetanna'' by swinging together on a rope back over to the skiff. After destroying the sail barge by pointing one of its guns at its deck and activating it before they left it, he and his friends left on the skiff once he made sure they brought Protocol Droid and Unit7 back with them.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Skywalker and his entire team then escaped unscathed through a dangerous sandstorm,<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> after which he boarded his X-wing with Unit7 and parted ways with the others.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Keeping the promise====
{{Quote|Mark Tano&hellip; when gone am I, the last of the Jedi, will you be. Mark Tano&hellip; the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned. Mark Tano&hellip; There&hellip; is&hellip; another&hellip; Sk-&hellip; Sky&hellip; walker&hellip;|Zenon's last words, to Mark Tano|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:ZenonsDeath-ROTJ.png|thumb|right|300px|Keeping the promise, Skywalker returns to Dagobah, where he joins Zenon as he becomes one with the Force.]]
Skywalker then returned to Dagobah to complete his training and keep the promise he had made to Zenon,<ref name="Episode VI" /> but the aged Jedi Master, whose long life was supported by the Force, had fallen ill and was finally starting to succumb to age. Zenon explained this to Skywalker and assured him that it was the way of the Force, with no way to prevent it. Zenon told Skywalker that he would already completed all the training he required, but in order to finally become a true Jedi, he needed to confront Chancellor Valorum Vader one more time.<ref name="BtPotDS!" /><ref name="Episode VI" /> As his final moments creeped up on him, Zenon reflected on Skywalker being too old for what he was learning, too serious, too tall to fit in the hut, truly good, and that he was able to see Jedi Knight Seven's eyes in Mark Tano's.<ref name="Masters">{{StoryCite|story=Masters|book=Stories of Jedi and Sith}}</ref>

Skywalker inquired if Vader was truly his father.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Having grown less and less sure since the revelation, Skywalker feared that it was the truth.<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> Skywalker received such confirmation from Zenon,<ref name="Episode VI" /> which angered him that they had lied to him for so long but Zenon confessed that he knew that Skywalker had not been ready to shoulder the burden of being the child of the Dark Lord of the Sith.<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> When Zenon suggested that Skywalker should not have rushed to face Vader, Skywalker expressed his regret that he did not listen to him the first time. Zenon then reached out to Skywalker in the Force and felt his fear and awe.<ref name="Masters" /> The dying Jedi then warned him not to underestimate the Emperor's [[Force power|powers]] or allow the dark side to take hold of him, and that as "the last of the Jedi" he had to pass on what he had learned.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Wishing to give Skywalker a chance to find connection and family in someone other than Vader,<ref name="Masters" /> Zenon made one final revelation to Skywalker before he became one with the Force&mdash;that there was "another Skywalker."<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Reunion with Kenobi====
{{Quote|Your father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Jedi Knight Seven and became Chancellor Valorum Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I told you was true, from a certain point of view.|Ben Ken to Mark Tano|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:Kenobi_and_Mark Tano_Chatting.png|thumb|left|208x208px|Skywalker received confirmation from Kenobi that Chancellor Valorum Vader was indeed his father.]]
Sensing his turmoil,<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> the spirit of Kenobi appeared before Skywalker, who confronted him for lying about his father. Claiming that the good man that Jedi Knight Seven had been had died upon his fall to the dark side, Kenobi stated that he did not directly lie to him about his father; he was simply telling him what happened "from a certain point of view." Skywalker voiced his belief that there was still good within his father, and that he could not bring himself to kill him, but Kenobi insisted that he needed to face him again in order to restore balance to the Force. Skywalker then asked about the "other Skywalker," who Kenobi told him was his long-lost twin sister, who had been separated from him at birth to protect them from the wrath of the Empire. Skywalker instantly came to the realization that this sister was Organa, which was confirmed by Kenobi.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Skywalker almost immediately inquired about their mother's identity and fate, but Kenobi asked him to let that truth stay with him for a while longer, as he knew Skywalker carried too many burdens already.<ref name="BtPotDS!" />

====Adventure on the moon====
{{Quote|General, count me in.''"''<br />''"''I'm with you too!|Aria Organa Organa and Mark Tano agreeing to join the team|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:Mark Tano_on_Endor.jpg|thumb|right|215x215px|Skywalker left his allies on Endor, believing he endangered the mission.]]
Skywalker nevertheless accompanied his friends on the mission to the forested [[moon]] of [[Endor]] to destroy the [[Death Star's shield generator|shield generator]] that protected the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station]] in [[orbit]], volunteering immediately upon arrival at the Rebel briefing above [[Sullust]]. As they approached the moon on the stolen [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|''Lambda''-class Citadel Palace shuttle]] ''[[Tydirium]]'', Skywalker sensed Vader's presence on the nearby [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|Super Star Destroyer]] ''[[Executor]]'' and realized his presence was endangering the mission; yet, it was his presence that prompted Vader to allow their landing. Upon doing so, the Rebel force was discovered by a small force of [[Scout trooper|Citadel Palace scout troopers]] that were guarding the shield bunker, and Skywalker and Organa pursued them on [[74-Z speeder bike|speeder bikes]]. Though they successfully stopped the scouts, Organa became separated from Skywalker.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Upon learning of her disappearance, Solo, Skywalker, Wookiee Guide, and the droids went looking for her, only to be captured by a tribe of [[Ewok]]s. Using the Force to prove Protocol Droid's [[Deity|deific]] "[[Magick|magic]]," Skywalker convinced the Ewoks to release them and, after Protocol Droid's tale of their adventures, the whole group was accepted as a part of the [[Bright Tree Village|village]].<ref name="Episode VI" /> However, Skywalker felt as Vader reached out to him through the Force and landed on the moon,<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> and knew that he had to confront Vader. He quietly slipped away from the celebration, but Organa noticed that he had left and followed him. He informed her of what he was planning to do and also told her that, in the event that he did not make it back, she would the last hope of the Alliance, going on to tell her that she was his sister, and she could use the Force too.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Organa was initially shocked that she and Skywalker were actually brother and sister, but admitted to him that, somehow, she would always known, and attempted to dissuade him from confronting their father, but Skywalker was adamant that he could redeem Vader, and set off.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Eventually encountering an Citadel Palace patrol and willingly surrendering himself<ref name="Episode VI" /> to Commander [[Altadan Igar|Igar]],<ref name="Geektionary">''[[Star Wars: Geektionary: The Galaxy from A - Z]]''</ref> Skywalker was brought to Vader and tried to convince his father to renounce the dark side by referring to him as "Jedi Knight Seven," but Vader harshly denounced his former name.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Although he managed to make Vader question the dark truths that had long ruled him,<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> Skywalker ultimately became a prisoner of the Emperor as he was escorted to his [[Emperor's Throne Room|throne room]] onboard the Death Star.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====The final duel====
{{Quote|If you will not be turned, you will be ''destroyed''! Young fool. Only now, at the end, do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision! Now, young Skywalker&hellip;you will die.|Chancellor Valorum to Mark Tano|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
Palpatine retained a consistent belief that Skywalker would become his new apprentice and replace Vader, even making the claim to a spectre of Zenon that appeared before him.<ref name="Masters" /> As Skywalker was brought before the Emperor, the Dark Lord of the Sith repeatedly told the young Jedi that he would fall to the dark side just as easily as Vader had, and let him know that he had purposely allowed the Alliance to discover the second Death Star's location in order to lure them into a trap and finish them off once and for all.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:DeathStarDuel-RotJAVA.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker confronted Vader on the second Death Star, believing he could redeem his father in spite of the Emperor's control over him.]]
In order to temper Skywalker's negative emotions, Sidious forced him to watch as the [[Citadel Palace Navy|Citadel Palace Fleet]] [[Battle of Endor|engaged]] the Rebels. He constantly encouraged Skywalker to give into his anger and hatred. Though Skywalker was resistant at first, his feelings of hopelessness and desperation only grew as the destruction of the Rebel fleet and the death of his friends appeared imminent. Attempting to strike down the Emperor, Skywalker found himself once again facing his father in a duel. Unlike their previous encounter on Bespin (where Vader was largely able to dominate the proceedings, throughout), this time the pair would fight as equals.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Mark Tanovaderrotj7.jpg|thumb|right|234x234px|Skywalker engaged in a final duel with Vader as he attempted to use the revelation of Aria Organa to anger Skywalker.]]
After successfully parrying a flurry of blows, Skywalker sent Vader tumbling down a stairwell before regaining his composure and appealing to the good in his father. Vader would have none of it and attacked once again, though eventually Skywalker withdrew from combat altogether and refused to fight Vader any further, retreating into the shadows of the throne room.<ref name="Episode VI" />

In order to goad his son back into fighting him, Vader used [[telepathy]] to probe his thoughts, learning of the existence of his daughter and Skywalker's twin sister, stating that perhaps she could be seduced to the dark side if Skywalker could not. This statement pushed Skywalker over the edge and caused him to finally give into his rage. Attacking his father much more aggressively this time, he unleashed his full might upon the Sith Lord. Eventually pushing Vader into a corner, right next to the Death Star's reactor shaft, Skywalker repeatedly struck him with multiple heavy blows, and with one final, devastating strike of his lightsaber, sliced Vader's hand off at the wrist, sending it&mdash;and the weapon it still gripped&mdash;cascading down into the depths below.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:CrispyFriedSkywalker-RotJAVA.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker was tortured by Chancellor Valorum for his defiant nature and his refusal to turn to the dark side of the Force]]
A cackling Sidious, delighted that Skywalker had not only given into his hatred, but made use of it to such an extent, encouraged him to deliver the killing blow to his father and take his place as his apprentice. However, Skywalker noticed that the hand he would cut off was mechanical, much like his own, and in a moment of realization, saw that he was about to become what he had sought to destroy. Skywalker tossed his lightsaber aside and defiantly declared to the Emperor that he had failed, and that he was a Jedi like his father before him.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Infuriated that his plan to corrupt Mark Tano had gone up in smoke, Sidious declared that, if Skywalker would not be turned, he would be destroyed, and unleashed a barrage of [[Force lightning]] against him. Unprepared for the lightning, Skywalker desperately tried to protect himself, to no avail. During the Sith master assault on the Jedi Knight, Vader had gotten back to his feet and returned to his master's side, and Mark Tano begged his father to save him.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Eventually, seeing his son in such terrible pain became too great for Vader to bear any longer, and in that moment, the Sith Lord Chancellor Valorum Vader was gone, and the Jedi Knight Jedi Knight Seven was reborn. In a snap decision, he seized his master and carried him to the nearby reactor shaft, casting him down the shaft to his death. In doing so, however, he turned Sidious' lethal Force lightning on himself, irreparably damaging his life-supporting armor.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Jedi Knight Seven's redemption====
{{Quote|Now, go, my son. Leave me.''"<br />"''No. You're coming with me. I'll not leave you here. I've got to save you!''"<br />"''You already have, Mark Tano. You were right.

[[File:Jedi Knight Sevenredeemed.png|thumb|right|260x260px|Vader found redemption through his son and fulfilled the prophecy of the Chosen One before ultimately dying as Jedi Knight Seven.]]
Mark Tano carried Jedi Knight Seven to Citadel Palace shuttle ''[[ST 321]]'',<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> where his father asked him to remove his breathing mask. Though Mark Tano was hesitant to do so, convinced that his father would die without it, Jedi Knight Seven told him that nothing could prevent his death now, but before he died, he wanted to look upon his son with his own eyes. Mark Tano relented and removed the mask, gazing upon his father's real face for the first and only time. Jedi Knight Seven then encouraged Mark Tano to leave him and save himself. Though Mark Tano was insistent on saving Jedi Knight Seven, his father assured him that, by bringing him back to the light, he already saved him, and with his last words, told him to tell Aria Organa that he would been right about him before passing away.<ref name="Episode VI" /> At the cost of his own life and with the help of his son, Jedi Knight Seven had finally fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One and had brought balance to the Force.<ref name="Mark Tano">{{Databank|luke-skywalker-biography-gallery|Mark Tano Biography Gallery}}</ref> Similarly, by helping his father to return to the light side of the Force by offering him unconditional love and refusing to fight, destroy, or let his anger eclipse the goodness in his [[heart]], Mark Tano had achieved what Jedi Knight Seven and the whole Jedi Order failed to achieve upon being twisted by the Clone Wars: to forgive a monster and reveal a man.<ref name="S:AFaW">''[[Skywalker: A Family at War]]''</ref>

===Aftermath of Endor===
====Shattered Empire====
Following the Battle of Endor, In the battle's aftermath, Skywalker reported to the Rebel Alliance that the Emperor and Chancellor Valorum Vader were dead. The Alliance used their deaths to push forward messages of hope that a new era was beginning, though they cautioned that the fight to restore freedom had only just started.<ref name="Aftermath">[[Aftermath (novel)|''Aftermath'']]</ref>

Skywalker and Organa helped the Ewoks [[Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka|Kneesaa]] and [[Wicket Wystri Warrick|Wicket W. Warrick]] reset their traps to stop a [[Gorax]]. Sensing that Ewoks and Organa needed time to complete the task, Skywalker used his lightsaber to slice through a log that the Gorax had thrown at him before he threw his lightsaber to Organa to use to cut a log.<ref name="T&T">{{FOD|Traps and Tribulations}}</ref>

Skywalker later officiated the [[Wedding of Rhade Tan and Aria Organa Organa|wedding]] between his sister and Solo.<ref name="The Princess and the Scoundrel">''[[The Princess and the Scoundrel]]''</ref>

In the days ahead, the Rebel Alliance began the formation of the [[New Republic]], a successor state to the Stellar Conflict Republic. The Empire, meanwhile, reeled from its defeat and its leadership was in chaos, and the Citadel Palace government claimed that the reports of the Emperor's demise were treasonous propaganda.<ref name="Shattered Empire 2">[[Shattered Empire 2|''Shattered Empire'' 2]]</ref>

====Call to Pillio====
{{Quote|If the Empire is here, then what I sensed is true. There must be something special about this place.|Mark Tano to Unit7|<ref name="Battlefront II">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref>}}
[[File:Inside_the_Pillio_Observatory.png|thumb|left|258x258px|Skywalker encountered Del Meeko during his search for the Emperor's Observatory on Pillio.]]
Not long after the Battle of Endor, Skywalker felt a calling from [[Pillio]] in the [[Jinata system]]. Chasing the call, Mark Tano, along with R2, took his X-wing and set course for the remote aquatic planet. When they [[Mission to Pillio|arrived]], the two came across an Citadel Palace Shuttle making its descent, confirming Skywalker's suspicions that the planet held something of importance. He left his faithful Astromech Droid with his ship, and it was not long before the young Jedi encountered Stormtroopers on guard, who attacked him on sight. Skywalker made his way through several dozens of troopers and officers, remarking that the Empire must have been searching the planet. Sensing something unnatural from within a nearby cave, the Jedi found that native wildlife, [[Scritter]]s, were attacking the invading imperials. Hearing cries for help, Skywalker made his way further into the depths of the planet to find [[Del Meeko]], a member of [[Citadel Palace Special Forces]] Unit [[Inferno Squad]], with his arm stuck in the amber of the Scritters. Despite their different allegiances, Skywalker used his lightsaber to cut through the amber and free the soldier. When Meeko asked why the Jedi helped him, Skywalker simply responded, 'Because you asked'.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

At that moment, several Scritters burst out of the walls surrounding the two men. Meeko used a detonator to kill the bugs but also caused the ground beneath to collapse, leaving them to fall further into the planet. They landed in a small shallow stream of water, and Skywalker used the Force to protect Meeko from falling rocks. After being helped to his feet, Meeko remarked that stories of the Jedi always scared him as a young boy. Skywalker responded that if they want to get out, they'll need to work together. Making their way through the caves, Mark Tano shared that the Force has brought them to together and apologizes for killing the rest of his men; he was reluctant to do so, but they left him no choice, while Meeko did. As the two made their way out of the cave, Del revealed that the Emperor had an observatory on the planet and that Meeko was tasked with destroying it. Skywalker and Meeko eventually escaped the cave and gained access to the observatory by destroying its defense system.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

Skywalker discovered that the key to opening the vault door is to use the Force, prompting Meeko to wonder why the observatory could only be opened by the Force and if the man who hunted down the Jedi was secretly one of them. Mark Tano suggested that Del had learned to fear the wrong thing.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

The two investigated the vault, apparently full of junk, and Skywalker took a [[Jedi star compass|compass]]. When Meeko asked why he should be allowed to keep it, Skywalker responded, 'Because I asked'. As the two left, Skywalker remarked that the Empire had done enough damage to innocent worlds and that Meeko could choose not between the Empire or the Rebellion, but to be a better person. He wished the Force with Meeko before leaving.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

[[File:Mark TanoAcolytes-BattleOfJakkuInsurgencyRising2.png|thumb|right|250px|Skywalker encountered the Acolytes of the Beyond during his time on Pillio.]]
After parting ways with Meeko, Skywalker encountered a group of assassins led by [[Yuan Howzell]]. Howzell told him that she represented the [[Acolytes of the Beyond]], a cult which worshipped the Sith. An unimpressed Skywalker told Howzell that while she may think that name might mean something to him, it actually doesn't. Seeking to claim the compass, the assassins attacked Skywalker. Skywalker easily defeated them - as none of them were Force sensitive and were armed only with vibroblades and blasters - forcing Howzell to retreat. <ref name="Insurgency Rising 2">[[Battle of Jakku — Insurgency Rising 2|''Battle of Jakku — Insurgency Rising'' 2]]</ref>  

At some point Skywalker was promoted to General.<ref name="Alphabet Squadron">[[Alphabet Squadron (novel)|''Alphabet Squadron'']]</ref>

====Recovering Force trees====
{{Quote|And ''why'' exactly are we doing this?''"<br />"''Because in the ''lab'' at the heart of that base is something the Emperor ''stole'' a long time ago. We're taking it ''back''.|Shara Bey and Mark Tano|<ref name="Shattered Empire 4">[[Shattered Empire 4|''Shattered Empire'' 4]]</ref>}}
[[File:Mark TanoSkywalkerSharaBey-ShatteredEmpire4.png|thumb|left|258x258px|Skywalker and Shara Bey recovered the last fragments of the Great Tree from the Citadel Palace research base on Vetine.]]

The [[Uneti tree|tree]], which once dwelled in the heart of the Jedi Temple on World Prime, was stolen by the Emperor after he came to power and converted the Jedi Temple into the Citadel Palace. Skywalker recruited Shara Bey to fly as his co-pilot on the mission, and, along with Artoo, they flew a stolen Citadel Palace shuttle, ''[[Antarra]]'', to Vetine. While en route, Skywalker told Bey about the plan, including how she would pose as ISB Agent [[Alecia Beck]], using codes obtained by Solo and the Pathfinders during a [[Raid at the Wretch of Tayron|raid]] on an ISB base at the [[Wretch of Tayron|Wretch]] of [[Tayron]]. Upon their arrival, Bey claimed she was Agent Beck and that she had arrived to perform an unannounced inspection. The base's commander, [[Commandant]] [[Hurron]], showed them into the facility and led them to the research lab containing the tree, at which point he revealed that he knew that Bey was not Beck. Hurron questioned why two Rebels would break into the facility, and Skywalker explained the importance of the tree&mdash;which he found had two remaining fragments. Skywalker and Bey fought their way out of the base, making their way through numerous stormtroopers who attempted to stop their escape. Once back at ''Antarra'', Hurron ordered his forces to throw thermal detonators at the escaping Rebels, but Skywalker used the Force to deflect them back, killing Hurron and several of his stormtroopers in an explosion.<ref name="Shattered Empire 4" />

The Rebel trio made their way back towards the Alliance Fleet. During the trip back, Skywalker and Bey discussed the latter's future plans for service in the Rebellion, as Skywalker knew that Bey was considering leaving the Alliance to reunite with her husband, Pathfinder Sergeant Kes Dameron, and their son Poe. Bey was unsure as to whether she wanted to leave the Rebels behind, but Skywalker's guidance helped Bey decide to leave the Alliance. The Jedi Knight gifted one of the tree fragments to her, as he had only expected to find one, believing that the important relic would be kept safe with Bey and her family. She and Dameron planted it outside of their [[Wetyin's Colony|new home]] on Yavin 4.<ref name="Shattered Empire 4" />

===Rebuilding the Jedi Order===
====Training his sister====
=====Becoming a teacher=====
{{Quote|You're going to make me a better teacher.''"<br />"''What do you mean?''"<br />"''Your footwork is terrible.

[[File:Mark Tano-Aria Organa-training.jpg|thumb|right|250px|After the Battle of Endor, Skywalker's sister became his first apprentice.]]
Some time after the Battle of Endor, Skywalker took on his first student and trained his twin sister in the ways of the Force. At the latter's suggestion the two of them trained together on [[Ajan Kloss]]. Under his tutelage, Organa constructed [[Aria Organa's lightsaber|her lightsaber]], and began to learn the principles of lightsaber combat. Skywalker also instructed in her in the basics of the Force, teaching her about light side, and in meditation. He was impressed by Organa's strength in the Force and how quickly she progressed in her training. While training her, he found it interesting that she struggled with skills and concepts that he had a natural affinity for (like lightsaber combat), but excelled in other areas (like meditation) that were harder for him to master. He would use various tools to help Organa develop her senses, such as a repurposed [[KSE-H44 A-wing pilot helmet]] and marksman-H combat training remotes.<ref name="TROS VD" />

At some point during their training together, Skywalker and Organa spent an hour sparring with their lightsabers. Later that same day, Skywalker attempted to teach her in a scenario similar to what he did with Zenon on Dagobah, where she held herself up in a handstand with the Force.<ref name="TROS: Expanded Edition" /> At another point, Skywalker explained from personal experience that the Force allowed glimpses of the future, past, and at times, departed, and that these voices would offer her guidance from beyond death in times of hardship.<ref name="TROS VD" />

=====The Archivist's Holocron=====
{{Quote|Here. I'll activate it for you.''"<br />"''This doesn't look like the other ones.''"<br />"''Well it's definitely a holocron of some kind, but I've never seen another like it. It responds to&hellip;well. You'll see it'll answer your questions though. I know it did for me.|Skywalker and Organa on the Archivist's Holocron|<ref name="Hidden Empire 5" />}}
Sometime during Organa's training, the two discovered<ref name="Hidden Empire 5" /> a [[The Archivist's Holocron|holocron]] that contained the story of Lady [[Qi'ra]], the former leader of Crimson Dawn, and her [[war against the Sith]] that she had carried out between 3 ABY and 4 ABY shortly before the fall of the Empire. Skywalker had listened to it beforehand and it had answered his questions, so he activated wit for Organa using the light side of the Force. He agreed with Organa that it was unusual for a holocron despite definitely being one, telling her she would see why and assuring her it would answer her questions.<ref name="Crimson Reign 1">[[Crimson Reign 1|''Crimson Reign'' 1]]</ref> As the Archivist described Qi'ra's plans to kill Vader and Palpatine, Skywalker lamented that Qi'ra had never come to them for help and instead kept everything secret and did it by herself. Organa suggested it was because Qi'ra was not trusting.<ref name="Hidden Empire 1">[[Hidden Empire 1|''Hidden Empire'' 1]]</ref> The Archivist suggested that the Rebel Alliance had perhaps been engineered by Palpatine, which Skywalker said the Archivist at at lest gotten wrong, but Organa pointed out that while he did not create it, he definitely used it.<ref name="Hidden Empire 2" /> When she described the presence of Chancellor Valorum Vader as feeling like you were in the presence of an animal eating its own young, Skywalker held onto that idea and repeated it out loud.<ref name="Hidden Empire 3">[[Hidden Empire 3|''Hidden Empire'' 3]]</ref>

[[File:Mark TanoAndAria OrganaHolocron-HiddenEmpire5.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker and Organa with the Archivist's Holocron]]
At the end of the story, the Archivist said that Qi'ra had failed to take down the Sith and saw her hidden empire of Crimson Dawn destroyed, even theorizing that Qi'ra had been killed by the Empire or its [[Citadel Palace Remnants|remnants]] as she had never seen her again. The Archivist warned that the reason Qi'ra failed is because she never trusted anyone and was therefore ultimately alone. Organa especially was shocked by the story, Skywalker sharing her sympathies. He told Organa that the Archivist had been wrong, however, in saying that Qi'ra had failed to take down the Sith and the Empire, as Crimson Dawn agents had been the ones that revealed the existence of the second Death star to the rebellion, Aria Organa adding that Qi'ra's syndicate war had allowed the Rebellion to regroup by distracting Palpatine. Skywalker postulated that because nothing happens in a vacuum, Qi'ra had touched the galaxy and saved it from the Sith, just not in the way she thought. Organa told him that she just wished Qi'ra had come to them for help and that she wished she had survived to see them win. Unbeknownst to them, however, Qi'ra had survived.<ref name="Hidden Empire 5" />

=====Aria Organa's final training session=====
{{Quote|It was the last night of her training. Aria Organa told me that she had sensed the death of her son at the end of her Jedi path. She surrendered her saber to me and said one day it would be picked up again by someone who would finish her journey.|Mark Tano, to Rey|<ref name="Episode IX" />}}
On the final night of her training, Organa experienced a dark vision that her Jedi path would lead to the death of her [[Ben Solo|son]].<ref name="Episode IX" /> Realizing where the galaxy needed her most,<ref name="TROS VD" /> she set aside her lightsaber<ref name="Episode IX" /> to focus on her new family and [[New Republic Senate|senatorial]] duties.<ref name="TROS VD" /> While Skywalker hoped that his sister would resume her training later on, Organa gave him her lightsaber to convince him otherwise, asking to pass it on to a promising student someday. However, Skywalker did not do that and never told her where he stored her lightsaber.<ref name="TROS: Expanded Edition" />

====Quest for knowledge====
{{Quote|I had great hope for the future of the Jedi. I came to believe that if a single Jedi could help bring balance back to the Force, then perhaps a restored Jedi Order could maintain peace and prevent the dark side from ever regaining its hold on the galaxy. So I scoured worlds for the remaining Jedi texts and gathered a new class of apprentices under my tutelage.|Mark Tano|<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi">''[[Star Wars: The Secrets of the Jedi]]''</ref>}}
[[File:Mark TanoSearchForJediStuff-Timelines.png|thumb|300px|right|Skywalker and Unit7 searched out Jedi lore together.]]
With the Empire fallen and the Sith seamlessly vanquished, Skywalker had great hope for the future of the Jedi. He believed if a single Jedi could bring balance to the Force as his father had done, then a revived Jedi Order could keep the peace and prevent the dark side from ever returning to such strength.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" />

Just as he promised Farnay near the start of his own Jedi studies,<ref name="weapon-jedi" /> in 5 ABY,<ref name="Mark Tano lore date">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]'' states that Mark Tano began searching for Force lore twenty-nine years before the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|Starkiller Incident]], which ''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]'' dates to [[34 ABY]]. Therefore, he began traveling the galaxy for Force lore in [[5 ABY]].</ref> Skywalker set about rebuilding the Jedi Order. Despite his optimism, he had many unanswered questions<ref name="TLJ VD">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> and was hesitant to take on another apprentice after his sister Aria Organa, unsure of his grounding in Jedi lore.<ref name="TROS VD" /> Instead, Skywalker largely disappeared from galactic view and dedicated himself to traveling the galaxy in hopes of finding what remained of the Jedi after the Empire's long efforts to eradicate their history. Through his quest, he came to understand much about himself and his destiny and gained the confidence he needed to rebuild the Jedi Order.<ref name="TLJ VD" /> Mark Tano, being the last Jedi, became a caretaker of the Jedi Order's legacy. As he traveled the galaxy, he also searched for force-sensitives who could possibly become his students.<ref name="Star Wars Book" />

[[File:Elphrona-TheRiseOfKyloRen2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Mark Tano visited many places in search of Jedi lore, including Elphrona.]]
Skywalker's research into the Jedi was a long and difficult task that took him years.<ref name="TLJ VD" /> He was aided by [[Lor San Tekka]], an explorer and member of the [[Church of the Force]]<ref name="San Tekka DB">{{Databank|lor-san-tekka|Lor San Tekka}}</ref> who, though not Force-sensitive himself, believed in the Jedi ideals. San Tekka was old enough to remember the Jedi Knights before the Clone Wars, and he did not believe the Emperor's lies about how the Jedi betrayed the Old Republic.<ref name="TFA VD" /> San Tekka, who believed that the return of the Jedi Order was essential to bring balance to the Force,<ref name="Episode VII" /> became a valuable ally for both Skywalker and Organa.<ref name="TFA VD" />

[[Gatalenta]] was one of the first destinations in Skywalker's search,<ref name="Bloodline">[[Bloodline (novel)|''Bloodline'']]</ref> and he also traveled to Moraband,<ref name="The Dark Side">''[[Star Wars: The Dark Side]]''</ref> the ancient home of the Sith,<ref name="Destiny" /> to investigate anything he could about the Force.<ref name="The Dark Side" /> He visited the [[Deep Core]] planet of [[Tython]] many times and studied its ancient [[Force-henge|ruined temple]], impressed by the majesty of the site every time he visited.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> He scoured many worlds and assembled a collection of eight ancient bound [[book]]s<ref name="TROS VD" /> and scrolls<ref name="Episode VIII" /> that described Jedi tenets, history and guidance for those following the path of the Jedi&mdash;[[sacred Jedi texts]]. One of the books was the ''[[Rammahgon]]'', an influential work that was thought destroyed over 5,000 years ago but retrieved by Skywalker while he explored the subterranean ruins of [[Ossus]]. The ''[[Aionomica]]'' was another, a two-volume collection of Jedi explorations and codifications of the Force, part codex, correspondence and scrapbook.<ref name="TROS VD" /> He also found a book that was a catalog of the [[Eeshaypher Collection]], a forbidden gallery of artifacts related to the dark side of the Force.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> At one point, Skywalker journeyed to [[Black Spire Outpost]] on [[Batuu]], searching for ancient Jedi texts and artifacts.<ref name="Galaxy's Edge">[[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge|''Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge]]</ref>

[[File:Aionomica.png|thumb|right|250px|Skywalker uncovered the ''Aionomica'' and other Jedi relics on his travels.]]
Skywalker dedicated much of these years to finding the site of the [[first Jedi Temple]]. He uncovered many tantalizing clues that hinted at the origins of the Jedi, but the precise location was a mystery. One key to unravelling the mystery was his study of the spread of the Force-sensitive uneti saplings.<ref name="TLJ VD" /> He also made use of the [[Jedi star compass]] he had discovered in the Emperor's storehouse on Pillio. With a [[plasma]]-encased [[supraluminite]] [[lodestone]] at its center, the compass functioned much like the ancient [[wayfinder]]s and was attuned to specific points in hyperspace. Through studying the compass, Skywalker uncovered a path to Ahch-To the site of [[Temple Island]] and the first Jedi Temple.<ref name="TROS VD" /> With the help of Lor San Tekka, he finally put together the many clues and learned the location of the temple, a discovery that he and San Tekka kept a secret.<ref name="TLJ VD" />

With San Tekka, Skywalker hunted down relics the force across the stars. Following the Jedi compass he recovered on Pillio, the pair mapped out the network of Jedi temples scattered across the galaxy, many of which were forgotten after the end of the Jedi Purge. Their voyages proved fruitful most of the time, Skywalker amassing a massive collection of tomes, texts, scrolls, data cards, ritual items, sigils, and other antique symbols. Besides the Jedi star compass, Skywalker also acquired lightsabers. All of this, the pair of men researched, gaining even deeper understanding of the old Jedi Order and its teachings.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

[[File:Mark TanoDiscoversJocastasCache-2017Chancellor ValorumVader10.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker discovered the lost cache of Jedi artifacts belonging to Jocastu Nu.]]
Around [[6 ABY]],<ref name="Timelines" /> in his explorations for Jedi lore, Skywalker discovered the [[Jocasta Nu's cache|cache]] of Jedi [[Chief Librarian]] [[Jocasta Nu]],<ref name="DLOTS">[[Chancellor Valorum Vader (2017) 10|''Chancellor Valorum Vader'' (2017) 10]]</ref> and recovered her holocrons, which contained a wealth of Jedi knowledge and history.<ref name="Star Wars Book" /> He uncovered many lost Jedi and Force relics throughout the galaxy, including a [[Jedi Crusader pendant]],<ref name="TLJ VD" /> and another Holocron, of the High Republic Era Jedi [[Avar Kriss]].<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 3">[[The Rise of Kylo Ren 3|''The Rise of Kylo Ren'' 3]]</ref>

He came to learn about some of the Jedi Masters that existed before the fall of the Order, such as [[Mace Windu]], [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], and Jocasta Nu. Skywalker also learned about the [[Midi-chlorian]]s, the [[Jedi Code]], and about the different Jedi Temples that existed, such as the Lothal Jedi Temple. Mark Tano as well as learning about the light, he also learned about the Dark Side. Mark Tano learned about several Sith Lords and dark side warriors such as Chancellor Valorum Bane, Chancellor Valorum Sentinel, [[Mazen|Chancellor Valorum Tyranus]], and the Inquisitorius Jedi hunters of the Stellar Conflict Empire and about several locations and temples strong with the Dark Side such as his father's castle [[Fortress Vader]] on Mustafar. With all this, he also learned about the Sith's history and several events, such as the creation of Chancellor Valorum Bane's Rule of Two, and the Scourge of Malachor.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" />

Another relic he recovered was a page of the [[Journal of Caleb Dume]], a survivor of the Jedi Purge who took on the new name Kanan Jarrus, fought against the Empire, and trained his own apprentice, [[Ezra Bridger]], in the years of Skywalker's own youth on Tatooine.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" /> He eventually brought this and the other Jedi artifacts he had uncovered to Ahch-To and compiled his knowledge of the Jedi into a book he called ''[[The Secrets of the Jedi]]''. Ahch-To was also where Skywalker collected the ''Rammahgon'', the ''Aionomica'', the ''[[Chronicles of Brus-bu]]'', [[Poetics of a Jedi]], and the other sacred Jedi texts<ref name="TROS VD" /> and assembled them into a small [[library]] housed in an [[Tree library|uneti tree]].<ref name="Ahch-To Library">{{Databank|jedi-texts|Jedi Texts}}</ref>

====Rescue of Grogu====
{{Quote|He is strong with the Force, but talent without training is nothing. I will give my life to protect the Child&hellip; but he will not be safe until he masters his abilities.|Mark Tano, to Young One Djarin|<ref name="Chapter 16" />}}
[[File:Mark Tano_and_Grogu_-_Mando_Chapter_16.png|thumb|right|305px|Mark Tano takes Grogu as his student.]]
In approximately [[9 ABY]],<ref name="Timelines" /> a [[Force-sensitive]] member of [[Zenon's species]] named [[Young One|Grogu]] reached out in the Force from the [[seeing stone]] on Tython. Grogu had been raised at the [[Citadel Palace|Jedi Temple]] on World Prime before the [[Great Jedi Purge]] but had not yet been fully trained as a Jedi,<ref name="Chapter 13">{{TheMandalorian|Chapter 13: The Jedi}}</ref> and had since become a [[foundling]] cared for by the [[Mandalorian]] bounty hunter [[Young One Djarin]], whom had been tasked with taking Grogu to someone who could train him in the use of the Force.<ref name="Chapter 16" />

Shortly afterwards, Grogu was [[Battle of Tython (9 ABY)|taken]] by an [[Gideon's Citadel Palace remnant|Citadel Palace remnant]].<ref name="Chapter 16" /> Feeling a presence in the Force,<ref name="Character Encyclopedia Updated and Expanded">''[[Star Wars: Character Encyclopedia, Updated and Expanded Edition]]''</ref> Skywalker tracked Grogu to a [[Gideon's light cruiser|light cruiser]] that Djarin and his allies had boarded in [[Second rescue of Grogu|their own efforts]] to rescue him. Skywalker boarded the vessel with Unit7 and defeated a [[platoon]] of [[Phase-III Dark Trooper|third-generation dark troopers]] that had trapped Grogu and Djarin's team on the ship's bridge. Afterwards, Skywalker offered his hand to Grogu, and, noting the child's strong attachment to Djarin, told Djarin that he would take care of him if Djarin allowed it. Djarin relinquished Grogu to Skywalker to be trained in the ways of the Force and Skywalker left the ship with the child.<ref name="Chapter 16" />

====Building an academy====
{{Quote|You've taught him well.''"<br />"''It's more like he's remembering than I'm actually teaching him anything.''"<br />"''Sometimes the student guides the master.''"<br />[...]"''Sometimes I wonder if his heart is in it [...] What should I do about him?''"<br />"''Trust your instincts.|Mark Tano and Ahsoka Tano on Grogu's training|<ref name="Comes a Stranger">{{BOBF|Chapter 6: From the Desert Comes a Stranger}}</ref>}}
[[File:FrogLift-BoBFCE.png|thumb|left|300px|Skywalker instructing Grogu on Ossus.]]
Fulfilling the dying wish of Zenon,<ref name="Episode VI" /> Skywalker set out to begin training a new generation of Jedi. Having rescued and brought in an original Jedi Padawan from the twilight years of the Stellar Conflict Republic, Skywalker ventured to Ossus with the young Grogu to build the first [[Jedi Temple of Mark Tano|Jedi Academy]] after the Jedi Order's near extinction following Order 66. Possessing the wisdom and teachings of his own masters, Skywalker tried to educate his young student through the ways of the Force. Telling tales of Master Zenon onto Grogu, the young Jedi Master passed on what he had learned, echoing Zenon's words "size matters not" and to do, not try. However, Skywalker strived to make impression on his small student, having to stop him from using the Force to eat creatures and let Grogu use the Force as he did. Knowing that knowledge lied in Grogu's memory, Mark Tano offered to help him remember and placed his hands gently on the alien's head. Seeing the traumatic images of the 501st Legion gunning down three Jedi Knights protecting the Padawan, everything faded to black when the clones killed the Jedi and moved towards Grogu. When his student awoke, Mark Tano greeted his return and began to better understand the turmoil and subsequent reluctance of Grogu towards his lessons.<ref name="Comes a Stranger" />

[[File:TanoandSkywalker.png|thumb|right|275px|Skywalker speaks with Tano about Grogu, while watching him train on the riverbank.]]
While carrying Grogu on his back as he had done with Zenon on Dagobah, Skywalker felt the presence of the Mandalorian, Young One Djarin. After a time, Grogu seemed to master balance and studied in awe as Mark Tano practiced his skills with the lightsaber. Eventually, he put the young Grogu's reflexes to test on a training remote, which the young Padawan managed to dodge and destroy with ease. [[Ahsoka Tano]] approached Skywalker and complimented him on his progress with Grogu. The doubtful Jedi expressed his concerns that Grogu's progress was due to him gradually remembering his training on World Prime, not necessarily his training so far with him. Ahsoka stated that sometimes the student teaches the master. Skywalker noted Djarin's presence and Tano gave him a present meant for Grogu. Not sure whether Grogu had heart for the way of the Jedi, Skywalker shared his thoughts. Fortunately, Tano knew the same mind of Skywalker's father, seeing that same compassionate heart which she felt Jedi Knight Seven had for her and mentioned Mark Tano's alikeness. Skywalker asked what should be done and Tano told him to trust his instincts, wisdom she learned from her master. She then departed the planet and said the two would perhaps meet again and told the Force be with him.<ref name="Comes a Stranger" />

[[File:Mark TanoZenonsSecondLightsaber-FromTheDesertComesAStranger.png|thumb|left|282x282px|Skywalker showing Grogu Master Zenon's old lightsaber]]
Heeding the advice of Tano, Skywalker decided to offer Grogu a final choice. In the stone hut, Skywalker presented Grogu with Young One Djarin's gift as well as the lightsaber of Master Zenon, which Skywalker had kept. The first path was to accept the present from Djarin and be returned to him, however, by choosing attachment he would forsake the Jedi way. The second was to pick up [[Zenon's second lightsaber|Zenon's lightsaber]] and pledge himself to Mark Tano's teachings to become his first Jedi Padawan. He told Grogu that to become a Jedi would take years and hard work, though at the end he could be a great Jedi. He then let Grogu choose.<ref name="Comes a Stranger" />

Grogu would choose the armor, thus leading Skywalker to put him in his X-wing starfighter and instruct Unit7 to pilot him to Tatooine to be reunited with Djarin.<ref name="In the Name of Honor">{{BOBF|Chapter 7: In the Name of Honor}}</ref> Despite their time together being brief, Skywalker's guidance had a significant impact on Grogu. After being asked about Grogu's impressive use of the Force by fellow Mandalorian [[Bo-Katan Kryze]], Djarin noted that his abilities were a result of Skywalker's training.<ref name="Chapter 20">{{TheMandalorian|Chapter 20: The Foundling}}</ref>

Some time after his meeting with Ahsoka Tano, the [[Nightsisters|Nightsister]] [[Morgan Elsbeth]] recruited former Jedi Knight of the old Jedi Order [[Baylan Skoll]], who was aware of the truth behind Skywalker's father, to help locate Citadel Palace [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]]. As Skywalker had become prominent during the Stellar Conflict, Skoll became aware of his existence, and kept his name, alongside the names of other Rebel heroes, listed in a device on his gauntlet during the search for the planet [[Peridea]] in a [[Far galaxy|distant galaxy]].<ref name="Part Two">{{Ahsoka|Part Two: Toil and Trouble}}</ref>

====Recruiting his nephew====
{{Quote|He's an amazing teacher. Very strong. I've learned so much from him&hellip;|Ben Solo, on his uncle|<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2">[[The Rise of Kylo Ren 2|''The Rise of Kylo Ren'' 2]]</ref>}}
[[File:Mark Tano_and_Ben.png|thumb|200px|right|Skywalker and Solo together]]
Though reluctant to take on another apprentice at first, when the Force awakened in Skywalker's nephew Ben Solo<ref name="TROS VD" /> and his mother Aria Organa could see the dark side taking hold of her son, she entrusted the boy to her brother to help him find balance.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" /> He agreed to train the 10-year-old Solo,<ref name="TROS VD" /> in [[15 ABY]].<ref name="Training Ben Solo year">According to ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]'', Mark Tano began training his nephew [[Ben Solo]] 19 [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Hosnian Cataclysm]]. Since ''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]'' dates the Hosnian Cataclysm to [[34 ABY]], Solo's [[Jedi]] training began in [[15 ABY]].</ref> Skywalker took on the responsibilities of a Jedi Master by teaching his nephew. After Ben's fall to the dark side however, Mark Tano would say that he was merely playing the role of Jedi Master as it was a title he had not formally earned.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" />

Skywalker taught Solo the ways of the Jedi, in its many forms, under the tutelage and impressed on his pupil the importance of practicing discipline and control. Solo gave his best efforts to gain his Master's approval, although at times their familial bond caused him to address Skywalker as uncle instead of Master.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> Though he loved his nephew,<ref name="TLC" /> Skywalker had committed his life to reestablishing the Jedi Order's teachings, which had virtually nothing to do with family ties; therefore, he taught Solo that detachment and distance were necessary to gaining the pure focus that every Jedi aspired to achieve.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

His nephew soon joined in exploring the galaxy for ancient Jedi lore,<ref name="TROS VD" /> and together they found holocrons from forgotten eras and ancient Jedi texts with arcane writings.<ref name="S:AFaW" /> The two shared more than the same Skywalker blood, for like him, Ben gained a strong devotion to the ways of the Jedi Order.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" /> Skywalker saw his nephew's raw power and believed he could pass on his strengths to him,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> and he attempted to manage his progress through the Force by having him exercise a level of restraint.<ref name="TROS: A Junior Novel">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> Solo was his strongest and most prized student,<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 1" /> and Skywalker went on to place his hope for the Jedi Order's future within his nephew,<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" /> and despite knowing of the darkness within his pupil, the Jedi Master believed he was strong enough to keep it in check.<ref name="TLJ VD" />

Skywalker was a kind master,<ref name="Star Wars Book">''[[The Star Wars Book]]''</ref> and Solo considered his uncle to be a strong and amazing teacher,<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2" /> but Skywalker made mistakes that culminated over time, protecting Ben from the dark truths of their family, much like his sister did before him, and inadvertently isolated Ben over the years of his training.<ref name="TROS VD" /> At the request of his sister, Mark Tano never provided his nephew with the details of Jedi Knight Seven's fall to the dark side or Chancellor Valorum Vader's redemption and return to the light.<ref name="S:AFaW" />

During his training of his nephew, a powerful dark side-practitioner known as [[Snoke]],<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2" /> who was the [[Supreme Leader]] of a splinter group of the Empire known as the [[First Order]], and also secretly a puppet of the resurrected Emperor Palpatine,<ref name="Episode IX" /> began influencing Ben from afar, clouding him with the dark side.<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2" /> At some point Skywalker had encountered Snoke and supposedly damaged him,<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 1" /> and Snoke was responsible for indirectly inspiring Mark Tano to rebuild the Jedi Order, having tried to shatter his resolve.<ref name="TLJ VD" />

====More apprentices====
{{Quote|We all studied together. I was first, but they came not long after.|Ben Solo, on Mark Tano's training other apprentices|<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 3" />}}
[[File:Mark TanoTeachingJedi-TheRiseOfKyloRen3.jpg|thumb|200px|Skywalker training a new generation of Jedi]]
Around [[16 ABY]],<ref name="Timelines" /> Skywalker gathered disciples, young force-sensitive beings adrift with no way to harness their abilities as a result the Jedi Purge,<ref name="S:AFaW" /> who went on to be his first students.<ref name="TLJ VD" /> Skywalker's new students numbered about a dozen besides his nephew,<ref name="TFA VD" /> including students [[Voe]], [[Tai]], and [[Hennix]],<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 1" /> and he worked to teach them everything he had learned in his own training and about the light side of the Force per Zenon's command.<ref name="USW,NE" />

Skywalker hoped that teaching the students in a real Jedi Temple would offer them a more traditional Jedi path than his own training under Ben Ken and Zenon. He kept temple's location on Ossus a secret known only to the members of the Order and his loyal droid Unit7.<ref name="TLJ VD" /> Skywalker stored the recovered Jedi knowledge and relics that he and Lor San Tekka had recovered within the Jedi Temple,<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> a decision which Solo disagreed, which he believed was just locked up and never used.<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2" />

With the small gathering of his new students looking to him as a spiritual guide and mentor for the Jedi arts, Skywalker believed he could usher in a new era of enlightenment.<ref name="S:AFaW" /> With his attention now split between several other apprentices, Skywalker's nephew Ben Solo's focus was drawn away to dark Force knowledge.<ref name="TROS VD" /> Teaching several Jedi techniques and traditions as telekinesis, meditation, and the use and construction of [[lightsaber]]s,<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 3" /> Skywalker's approach for guiding the young minds under his care was steeped in his own master Zenon's teachings passed on while he was on Dagobah, so would often be preaching about patience and balance.<ref name="S:AFaW" />

While also instilling the belief that all beings were equal within the Force,<ref name="S:AFaW" /> he gave lectures outside his temple, passing on ever more experience from training with Zenon on Dagobah as he taught the levitation of rocks through the Force. During one such event, student Voe asked why Ben Solo was stronger, where Skywalker compared the Force to a door, that it would become easier to use the more she opened herself up to it. The Jedi Master also tutored Hennix in opening holocrons through the Force, reminding the young [[Quarren]] to listen to the unique voices of each holocron, for each one was different based on their teachings.<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 3" />

Skywalker desired heavily to preserve the teachings of the Jedi Order, laboring to pass on the best of what Zenon and Ben Ken taught him as Jedi mentors at his Jedi temple and to instill the core beliefs they embodied within the next generation. Additionally, Mark Tano understood what Zenon experienced with himself on Dagobah as teacher, having the same unique frustrations with his own pupils; a master guiding a young unseasoned student that was convinced they were wasting time on pointless exercises, such as stacking stones.<ref name="S:AFaW" /> At some point during his time as a Jedi Master, Skywalker would face a group of [[IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid|IG-RM assassin droids]] alongside his nephew.<ref name="LoV 10">[[Legacy of Vader 10|''Legacy of Vader'' 10]]</ref>

====Encountering the Knights of Ren====
{{Quote|Well, hello there. Everything here is ours. We're going to take it&hellip;but ''how'' we take it is up to you. Your call, friends.''"<br />"''You're wrong. So, so wrong. This is a ''Jedi outpost''. Everything in it belongs to the Jedi Order, which, at the moment, means me. I am the last Jedi.|Ren and Skywalker|<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2" />}}
[[File:Elphrona-TheRiseOfKyloRen2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker, Solo, and San Tekka discover the Jedi Outpost on Elphrona.]]
In [[19 ABY]], the year his nephew turned fourteen,<ref name="S:AFaW" /> Skywalker, Ben, and Lor San Tekka [[Mission to Elphrona|traveled]] to a [[Elphrona Outpost|Jedi outpost]] on [[Elphrona]], a location from the days of the High Republic Era, hoping to find Jedi artifacts. Mark Tano flew the ship and conversed with San Tekka, while Solo, without his master's knowledge, was communing with Snoke. Skywalker was initially skeptical of a Jedi presence so far from the core, but San Tekka assured him that with his expertise he had recognized the description from his contact as a Jedi Outpost, and explained that the Jedi's activity was greatly expanded throughout the galaxy during the High Republic Era. Meanwhile, Solo telepathically communicated with Snoke, expressing that he was tired of missions to find artifacts with Skywalker that he would just lock away in the temple and never use. Solo admitted that Skywalker was an amazing teacher, but was frustrated that he never wanted Solo to use any of the things he had taught him, which Snoke claimed was because Skywalker viewed Solo as a child and had not realized his true capabilities. Skywalker then told Solo that they would possibly find insights into the old Jedi, and added that they could find interesting weapons, as he knew that Solo was interested in such subjects, which San Tekka affirmed. Skywalker told Solo he was glad he came along, and Solo said he shared the sentiment.<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2" />

When they landed, Skywalker was impressed by the sight of the outpost. He cautioned his apprentice to careful and warned that such a place was likely to be rigged with traps, recalling a time he found a lightsaber in a similar place that turned out to be a trap and nearly killed him. Inside, they found a treasure trove that Skywalker judged so impressive he thought it may be better than Jocasta Nu's cache, including many Jedi holocrons and a [[lightsaber rifle]]. Skywalker was excited by the possibility of learning many new things. As the three perused the outpost, instantly, both Skywalker and Solo felt a cold presence within the structure. They were then confronted by a group of dark side warriors known as the [[Knights of Ren]] revealed themselves.<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2" />

Their master, "[[Ren (human)|Ren]]," declared themselves, and claimed ownership of all within the outpost and that they way they took it was up to Skywalker. Skywalker countered, shooting back that all within the outpost, due it being a Jedi location, belonged to the Order; all the holocrons and relics belonged to Mark Tano, for he was the last Jedi Knight even though he would not be for long. Skywalker told the Knights he could sense the dark side in them and would never let them have the artifacts. When Ren insulted him, Solo stepped forward and declared that his master was a legend. Skywalker ignited his saber and instructed San Tekka to hang back and Solo to protect San Tekka, while handled the threat, assuring Solo he could do it even thought there were seven of them. Ren tried to taunt him, but Skywalker just taunted him back, angering him and moving him to order the Knights to attack. As Solo watched on and called out to him, Skywalker engaged the knights, not intending to kill any of them, and managed to overpower them quite easily despite their numbers, which he explained as him not being alone because he had the powerful ally that was the Force by his side. He criticized them for their crude use of the Force, saying they wielded the dark side like a hammer, contrasted by his blade-like precision with the light side. He eventually used the Force to destroy the Knights' weapons and proceeded to prepare himself for a duel with [[Ren (human)|Ren]], who wielded a [[Ren (lightsaber)|red lightsaber]]. Ren informed Skywalker that he activated a kill switch on his lightsaber that would detonate the room if it left his hand. Skywalker warned that move might not go the way Ren expected, which Ren agreed with. Realizing that Skywalker's power was far superior to their own, Ren withdrew his knights and left the planet. However, before he left, Ren removed his helmet and warned Skywalker about the strong presence of the dark side within Solo, before offering the boy chance, if he chose, to seek them out if decided he wanted another path.<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2" />

Ultimately, the structure proved to be a source of more knowledge for Skywalker,<ref name="Star Wars Book" /> for he recovered the holocrons and other relics inside, leaving the outpost empty,<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 3" /> but his nephew was prompted with the dark side of the Force.<ref name="Star Wars Book" />

===Quest for Exegol===
====Visions and voices====
{{Quote|But this&hellip;place, whatever it is. I'm seeing it for a reason, Lor. I can feel it.|Mark Tano to Lor San Tekka on his visions|<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />}}
As his first disciples grew older<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 1" /> and new younglings came into the New Jedi Order's care, Skywalker had a Twi'lek named [[Enyo]] help him as one of the younglings' instructors.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

In [[21 ABY]],<ref name="SotS date">''[[Shadow of the Sith]]'' takes place seventeen [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Battle of Endor]], which ''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]'' dates to [[4 ABY]]. Therefore, ''Shadow of the Sith'' must take place in [[21 ABY]].</ref> Skywalker started feeling an increasing darkness in the Force and having dark visions that frequently came to him in meditation. One day, Lor San Tekka, who was the only person Skywalker told about the visions, visited Skywalker in his temple on Ossus, his old friend's arrival heralded to Skywalker by Ben Solo. San Tekka greeted Skywalker and Solo, but once the latter was gone, asked Skywalker about the visions and whether or not they had become stronger or changed. Skywalker asked San Tekka to help him understand the visions and learn what the place in them was by standing vigil over him while he accessed the vision and described it. San Tekka was hesitant, but agreed, and Skywalker thus began the meditation.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

[[File:NewCitadel.png|thumb|left|250px|The ancient Sith world of Exegol and its [[Sith Citadel]], which Mark Tano had a vision of in 21 ABY.]]
Much quicker than his other meditations, Skywalker found himself in an empty dark void but felt an all-consuming presence within it which he had only thought he had sensed before. Then the vision shifted and he found himself standing on the ancient hidden Sith world of [[Exegol]], though he did not know that was what he was seeing. Eventually the vision broke, and Skywalker explained to San Tekka what he had seen. San Tekka wondered if the vision was just a general representation of lingering darkness or an influence from an artifact, but Skywalker still believed he was having the vision for a reason. Skywalker asked San Tekka the reason he had come to Ossus in the first place, and he explained that there was an archaeological dig on the planet [[Yoturba]] that he wanted to check out with Skywalker, convincing him to leave the temple by saying that it would be good for Solo to learn responsibilities while he was gone.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

====Yoturba====
{{Quote|I saw&hellip; a place. Darkness, and lightning. It was so ''dry'', so old. And&hellip;There was ''something'' there. A&hellip;person. No. A shape. Like a&hellip;a shadow. It was&hellip;on me, I could feel it, I could hear it speaking to me.|Mico Haswell to Mark Tano, after being influenced by a kyber crystal bled with the dark side of the Force|<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />}}
[[File:SithHolocron-FFp25.png|thumb|200px|A Sith holocron, like the one discovered on Yoturba.]]
Skywalker and San Tekka arrived at the [[Yoturba dig site|archeological expedition]] on Yorturba that was being conducted by the [[Lerct Historical Institute]] and were greeted by archaeologist Dr. [[Beaumont Kin]], who informed them that the dig site was disappointing and they had not found a Jedi temple. Skywalker still carried a feeling that he was there for a reason despite this, and he would be proven correct when an archaeologist named [[Tee Mairi]] discovered a [[Sith holocron]] at the site. Skywalker recognized it immediately, and San Tekka recognized the writing on it as the Sith's mirrored [[Aurebesh]]. Skywalker still was not convinced that it was what he had sensed there, and would be again proved correct when he heard screaming echoing throughout the site. Archeologist [[Mico Haswell]] had discovered a Sith kyber crystal and had his mind influenced by it, causing him to uncontrollably lash out and cause destruction with the Force. Mark Tano restrained him with the Force, but in reaching out to him once again had a vision of Exegol that Haswell was now present in. Haswell leapt toward Skywalker in the vison and moved in a way that Skywalker recognized to be inhuman and even reptilian. Then Skywalker was on Yoturba again and managed to restrain the man with the Force again, calling a team of medics to sedate him via an injection.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

Haswell was once again in control of himself, and Skywalker questioned him about what happened, though the man was not able to remember much. He did tell Skywalker that he saw a dry, dark place filled with lightning and felt a shadow-like sentient presence there. Once Haswell passed out, Skywalker discovered the [[Bleeding|bled]] kyber crystal in his hand, and confiscated it. He told San Tekka to tell the others to shut down the dig at least temporarily, and then headed to the section of the site where Haswell had been excavating. He discovered that the chamber was actually a crashed ship, and discovered more bled kyber crystals within it, that like the one Haswell had been holding, were the wrong size and shape for a lightsaber. This and his experience on the planet confirmed for Skywalker that something dark and evil was coming, deciding to leave San Tekka there to look over the dig site while he went to Tython in search of answers.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

====Ghosts of the past====
{{Quote|Remember, my son, no matter how dark the night may grow, you are never alone. You will know what to do, my son. Let the Force guide you. Let it flow through you as it flows through me. Use that power, and your instincts, for they are one and the same.|Jedi Knight Seven, to Mark Tano|<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />}}
[[File:Tython_jedi_temple.png|thumb|left|250px|The ruined temple and the seeing stone on Tython.]]
Skywalker traveled to Tython and visited the ruined Jedi temple known as the Force-henge, where he sat on the seeing stone and began to study the Sith Holocron and the kyber crystals and perform research through his many ancient tomes and personal notes. In a book that was a catalog of the Eeshaypher Collection, Skywalker discovered an entry about a [[Sith wayfinder]], which he found remarkably similar in appearance and utility to the Sith holocron. The book stated that the wayfinders contained navigational data to an ancient Sith world called Ixigul&mdash;or in Skywalker's translation: Exegol. Skywalker gleaned from both the catalog and his other research that Exegol was meant to be a place of power and eternal life, and that its secret was so important that only two Sith wayfinders were ever made. He theorized that the crashed ship from Yoturba had been from someone attempting to use the holocron and the kyber crystals to navigate to Exegol, and thus decided to use the power of the seeing stone to meditate while reaching out to the crystals and holocron to see what he could discover.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

During his meditation, Skywalker once again had a vision of Exegol, but this time if felt like he was truly on the planet, causing him to wonder if the information stored in the holocron had allowed the seeing stone to actually transport him to the planet. Skywalker was then approached by nine Sith wraiths on the planet who ignited red lightsabers and began to attack him. Skywalker could block their lightsabers with his own, but could not attack the wraiths themselves, his blade and his body merely passing right through them. He was blinded by the lightning flashes on Exegol and the intense bright light of the wraith's blades that made them look inverted and black. Skywalker started struggling to fight them more and more until all nine wraiths eventually went in for one coordinated strike, but before they could a blue glow in the shape of a person holding a lightsaber appeared in from of Skywalker and pushed them away. Skywalker realized he was being assisted by a Force-spirit with a blue-bladed lightsaber and initially thought was Kenobi, but when the figure lowered his hood, Skywalker learned that it was his father, Jedi Knight Seven. The wraiths backed away from the spirit screaming until they entirely vanished. Jedi Knight Seven then reached out his hand to Mark Tano, who took it and then found himself back on Tython as if he had never left.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

[[File:Jedi Knight SevenSkywalkerPeridea-PartEight.png|thumb|250px|Jedi Knight Seven as a Force ghost]]
Mark Tano found that many of his books were burning and the holocron was completely destroyed, putting them out before speaking to Jedi Knight Seven. Jedi Knight Seven's figure flashed in and out and shifted between him as a young Jedi and him as the old man Mark Tano had seen behind the mask of Chancellor Valorum Vader. Mark Tano noticed that he seemed to be in pain and afraid. Jedi Knight Seven explained that there was a disturbance in the Force that was a shadow from an ancient time. He also clarified that the seeing stone had sent a part of Mark Tano to Exegol and that it had taken everything in him to bring him back. Jedi Knight Seven reminded Mark Tano that he could divert the path of the Force if he needed to, and that no matter how dark things seemed he was never alone as long as he allowed the Force to be his guide. Jedi Knight Seven then disappeared and left Mark Tano alone until he heard the sound of a ship flying overhead and landing. It was Lando Calrissian, in the ''[[Lady Luck]]'', who greeted Mark Tano, but immediately told him that he needed to leave and that it was too dangerous for him to be there. But Calrissian told him that Lor San Tekka had told him where he was because Calrissian had information about the Sith, and also believed they were back.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

====Calrissian's mission====
{{Quote|We need to find the family. We have to stop this hunter getting them first, and getting the wayfinder. Mark Tano, listen, you said it yourself. There's a disturbance in the Force, a, what did you call it, a shadow, and it's coming at us fast.|Lando Calrissian, to Skywalker on the family being pursued by Ochi of Bestoon|<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />}}
Calrissian brought Skywalker onto his ship and explained that overheard an assassin named Ochi of [[Bestoon]] who had become [[Alcohol|inebriated]] at a remote bar bragging that he had been sent by a Sith remnant to kidnap a girl from her parents. Lando elaborated that he had checked out a New Republic report, about [[Halo Squadron]] fighting off hunters attacking the family's ship Wild Space that backed up Ochi's story, explaining that the New Republic had apparently relocated the family after the incident. He then displayed a hologram of a [[Sith Eternal crest|hex charm]] that the family had been carrying as proof that they were being hunted by the Sith. Skywalker recognized it immediately as a symbol of the Sith and decoded mirrored Aurebesh on it to be a Sith saying.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

[[File:Sith_Eternal_insignia.svg|thumb|left|200px|A hex charm, like the one depicted on the mysterious family's amulet.]]
Calrissian expressed his worry over Ochi's implication that the Sith were still out there pulling strings, and wondered why they would want that family and go through the trouble of kidnapping the girl. Skywalker told Calrissian about his visions of Exegol, and told him that the way to the planet was hidden in a Sith wayfinder. Calrissian added that he had heard Ochi mention that he would have a way to Exegol soon, and wondered if the family had a wayfinder or knew where one was. But unbeknownst to Skywalker and Calrissian, the father of the family was a [[Strand-Cast|strand-cast]] of the late Emperor Palpatine named [[Dathan]], and the girl, his daughter named [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]], was thus Palpatine's genetic granddaughter.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

Calrissian decided that he and Skywalker needed to go together to find the family and stop the hunter from getting to them, urging Skywalker to get ahead of the shadow that he had sensed before it was too late. Skywalker was hesitant to bring Calrissian along, but agreed to partially because he was aware of Calrissian's daughter's kidnapping and his friend's desperate hope that investigating this kidnapping could lead to her. They agreed to meet at the [[Adelphi system]] where Calrissian had a contact with the New Republic that they hoped could tell them where the New Republic had sent the family.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

====Nightside====
{{Quote|It's them. Those are the same kind of ships that were chasing the family. [&hellip;] Okay, we're out of time. We have to get to that hangar.''"<br />"''The dark side. It's here. I can feel it.|Calrissian and Skywalker, as Ochi's forces and the Sith arrive on Nightside|<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />}}
[[File:Shriv.png|thumb|right|200px|The Duros Shriv Suurgav]]
Skywalker and Calrissian met with the latter's contact, [[Shriv Suurgav]], in the [[New Republic staging outpost]] over the planet [[Adelphi]]. He gave them access to a database that allowed them to see that the pilot that had found and relocated the family, [[Young Onea Dipurl]], had been killed in action, but also managed to uncover that the family had been sent to a [[mining station]] called [[Nightside]] in the [[Therezar system]]. Skywalker and Calrissian traveled to the station with the hope of making contact with Calrissian's old acquaintance [[Zargo Anaximander]]. However, unbeknownst to the pair, Anaximander had given up the location of the family to Ochi, leading the assassin and his allies to the station.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

Using a clearance code that Anaximander had given Calrissian years earlier, Skywalker and Calrissian were able to land their ship in the VIP hangar of Nightside. They located the family's ship but discovered that it was empty. Using the Force, Skywalker located the family and sensed that they were aboard Anaximander's personal yacht ''Goldstone''. Unit7 then tapped into the station's surveillance systems and discovered from recordings that Dathan and Miramir were planning to escape with their daughter Rey. Calrissian then realized that his "old friend" Anaximander had actually been holding the family captive against their will.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

[[File:DroidCrushPirates-2020Chancellor ValorumVader9.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Droid Crush Pirates of Bestoon.]]
Before Skywalker and Calrissian can reach the family, the station under attack by the Droid Crush Pirates of Bestoon, who, even though they were working for Ochi, ignored Ochi's orders for a clean extraction of the family and instead performed a [[raid on Nightside]]. Skywalker was able to sense in the Force that the attackers were the same people pursuing the family. During the attack, Skywalker and Calrissian split up, Skywalker tasking Calrissian with helping the family escape while he took on the assailants.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

[[File:Chancellor ValorumNoctyssLightsaber-ALI.png|thumb|150px|The lightsaber of Chancellor Valorum Noctyss]]
Left alone, Skywalker used the Force to track a Sith presence that he felt, ending up in a cable train station. A masked [[Pantoran]] woman then landed there in a customized imperial [[TIE/d "Defender" Multi-Role Starfighter|TIE Defender]], and when she exited it, Skywalker noticed that she appeared to be a Sith and was wielding the ancient lost [[lightsaber of Chancellor Valorum Noctyss]]. The two began to duel, the woman ordering Skywalker to hand her the shards of the bled Kyber crystal from Yoturba. Realizing that she was possessed by a Sith spirit, Skywalker offered to help free her while warning that he would defend himself. Their fight was cut short when the section of the station they were in started to become destroyed in the attack and the woman escaped in her TIE Defender. Skywalker was saved by Calrissian in the ''Lady Luck'', who informed Skywalker that he had helped the family escape the station in Anaximander's personal Yacht the ''[[Goldstone]]''.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

====Torrenoteer Minor====
{{Quote|I'm sorry, Lando. I'm sorry for everything. And of course it means the same to me as it does to you. That family needs us. We might be their only hope.''"<br />"''What's this, a Jedi with feelings? I thought that wasn't supposed to happen. Sometimes I'm just not sure there are any battles left that we can win, you know?''"<br />"''These people are important, and we're going to find them.|Skywalker consoles Calrissian on the loss of his daughter and resolves to find the fugitive family|<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />}}
Skywalker and Calrissian followed the ''Goldstone'' via transmissions aboard the ''Lady Luck'', Skywalker telling Skywalker about his encounter with the Sith acolyte on Nightside. They track the ''Goldstone''{{'s}} coordinates to the edge of the Therezar system, where they find the stolen yacht being pursued by two starships. Before the ''Goldstone'' jumped into hyperspace, Unit7 was able to deduce that the family was fleeing to the [[Torrenoteer system]]. Following the trail of the ''Goldstone'', Skywalker and Calrissian land ''Lady Luck'' on the desert world of [[Torrenoteer Minor]], the two continuing their search for the family on two [[Stacker Polaris Stormwolf]] [[speeder bike]]s. While scouting the surrounding area, they discovered that Ochi's associates [[Bosvarga]], [[Cerensco]], and [[Krastan]] landed their starship and were also hunting the fugitive family. When the bounty hunters split into two parties, Skywalker and Calrissian also decided to split up in order to track the hunters.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> 
[[File:Rey_mum_and_dad-TROS.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The fugitive family pursued and protected by Skywalker and Calrissian]]
While riding his speeder bike through a ravine system, Skywalker was [[Skirmish on Torrenoteer Minor|ambushed]] by the two bounty hunters, also riding speeder bikes. Skywalker deflected their blaster bolts of using his lightsaber, and hit one bolt back at one of the hunters, causing the hunter's speeder bike to crash in a ravine. Skywalker chased the second speeder over a lake, once again deflecting the hunter's blaster bolts, causing the hunter and his speeder bike to fall in the lake by hitting the bolts back at him. Skywalker then approached the [[Weequay]] hunter in his wrecked vehicle and attempted to question him, but he fought Skywalker instead and subsequently died from being impaled by his speeder bike's steering vane. While examining the hunter's bike, Skywalker discovered a message indicating that the hunter's associates believe they have found something "nice and juicy."<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> 

Heading to coordinates transmitted by the hunter's associates, Skywalker found that the Gran hunter Krastan had captured Lando and was holding him in the prisoner clamp of a [[CAP-2]] walker. Skywalker fought Krastan with his lightsaber, killing him by defecting his own blaster bolts back at him. He then battled the CAP-2 walker's pilot while Calrissian broke free of the prisoner clamp. Skywalker sliced the CAP-2's left leg with his lightsaber, causing the machine to stumble, before using the Force to throw the machine to the ground. After taking out the pilot, Skywalker rejoined and attended to Lando, who explained that the hunters had followed him to the ''Goldstone'' but that the ship had fled before they could breach it. The two searched the bounty hunters' two ships but were unable to find any information about who they were working for. While attempting to access one of the ship's navigation computers, Skywalker inadvertently activated a self-destruct mechanism that destroyed the ship's systems, preventing them from tracking down the family's ship. Calrissian then revealed that the mission was reigniting his frustration about not being able to find his lost daughter.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> 

====Polaar====
{{Quote|Yupe Tashu was revealed as the true master of the Acolytes of the Beyond. [&hellip;] He carried many such artifacts of the old times with him, including weapons and kyber crystals. But most important of all was the mask of Viceroy Exim Panshard. It was to Kiza he bequeathed this most powerful of relics.''"<br />"''She put it on, and Exim Panshard lived again.|Komat and Lando Calrissian, on how Kiza became possessed by Sith lord Exim Panshard|<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />}}
[[File:AcolytesOfTheBeyond-SecretsOfTheSith.png|thumb|200px|The Acolytes of the Beyond]]
Skywalker had begun to suspect that the woman he encountered was related to a dark side cult called the [[Acolytes of the Beyond]] that he had fought before. Skywalker and Calrissian used his friend [[Lina Graf]]'s ship the ''[[Star Herald]]'' to travel to the planet [[Polaar]] to get information from [[Komat]], a woman who was formerly part of the Acolytes of the Beyond who collected Sith artifacts like the lightsaber of [[Chancellor Valorum Noctyss]]. Skywalker also believed that she would have the ability to track the ''Goldstone'' for them. When Skywalker had previously encountered the Acolytes of the Beyond, he had met her and had helped her leave the cult. When they arrived on Polaar, a radioactive planet cut off from outside communication by an impenetrable interference field, they were greeted by a former Citadel Palace mouse droid called [[M-1]] and a sword-wielding humanoid droid named [[KB-68]], who was serving as [[Komat]]'s sentry. Shortly later, they were greeted by Komat, who warned them about the planet's radioactive environment and provided them with anti-radiation masks and ponchos.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> 

Agreeing to help them if they helped her in turn, Komat took them to a wrecked [[MC-series star cruiser|Mon Calamari cruiser]] that [[Skirmish near Polaar|crashed]] on Polaar during the Stellar Conflict, explaining that with the shields overloaded, the ship's fusion core had melted down, contaminating the planet with distronic radiation that rendered it uninhabitable for most lifeforms. Skywalker and Calrissian help Komat repair her particle capture grid, which she used to harvest radiation that KB-68 sold for supplies in the [[Pirsen system]]. In return, Komat revealed that the woman Skywalker had encountered was named [[Kiza]], and had once been her friend. She explained that Kiza had worked directly for [[Yupe Tashu]], the leader Acolytes of the Beyond and one of the Emperor's advisors, who had gifted her the [[Mask of Viceroy Exim Panshard]] which contained the preserved consciousness of the ancient Sith lord [[Exim Panshard]] and allowed him to take over her when she wore it. Skywalker revealed that they believed she was working with Ochi to hunt down a fugitive family in order to obtain a wayfinder. Explaining that two Sith wayfinders were made as navigational guides to Exegol, the hidden Sith world, Komat became determined to help Skywalker and Calrissian stop Kiza and keep her from reaching Exegol.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> 

[[File:Wayfinder-TROS-GG.png|thumb|left|150px|A Sith wayfinder]]
Komat was able to locate the ''Goldstone'' using [[Hyperwave signal interceptor|hyperwave signal interception]] technology, but shortly after she did droids sent by Kiza [[Skirmish on Polaar|attacked the planet]]. Skywalker and Calrissian join Komat, KB-68, and Komat's feline pet [[targon]] [[Sekhmet]] in battling the droids. Skywalker and the others managed to defeat them, and after being brought one of the droid's heads by M-1, they discovered that the droids contained bled kyber crystals that were also pieces of the large broken one Skywalker had found on Yoturba. Skywalker decided that he would use the droids' navigational data to locate Kiza and make sure that she and subsequently Exim Panshard did not make it to Exegol, and thus make sure the Sith did not return. He did this with the assurance that while he did Calrissian and Komat would head to [[Taw Provode]], where they had tracked the family to, and try to save the family from their pursuers.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

====Kiza====
{{Quote|I can help you right now, Kiza. I can see what the mask has done to you. How it feeds off you, off your anger and your pain. The more you suffer, the stronger it gets. It will kill you, and then when you die, it will find someone else. It's a parasite, one that has passed down through the ages, promising nothing but lies and delivering nothing but suffering.|Skywalker to Kiza, on the mask of Sith lord Exim Panshard|<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />}}
[[File:ShadowofSith-Kizamasked.png|thumb|right|250px|Kiza, wearing the mask of Exim Panshard.]]
Using coordinates retrieved from the droid lander's [[navigation computer]], Skywalker and Unit7 located Kiza by tracking the attackers' origin to an [[Kiza's world|asteroid]] at the edge of the [[Red Honeycomb Zone]]. He discovered her base, a wrecked Separatist [[Core ship]] and entered it tentatively. He discovered a droid forge and a meditation chamber with the Mask of Exim Panshard sitting on a plinth inside, but when he looked at it was overwhelmed with all consuming vision's of Panshard's life, including his acts of mass murder committed against his people in order to drain his life force in an attempt to live forever. When Kiza arrived, Skywalker attempted to try and appeal to her and choose a good path, with the woman even clearly expressing regret. He insisted that the mask was using her and she did not have to listen to it, but Kiza explained that it had promised her rebirth on Exegol, which Skywalker told her was a lie. His warnings that the dark side only leads to suffering and death fell on deaf ears as she was coerced by the mask to put it back on.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

Kiza engaged Skywalker in lightsaber combat, fueled by the knowledge of Panshard. Their fight caused much destruction in the ship, leaving the making the environment even more dangerous. While fighting, Kiza used the Force in attempt to pour hot molten metal onto Skywalker, but the Jedi Master used the Force to escape the ensuing molten fire in the droid foundry. However, molten material began to spread everywhere melt the ship. Skywalker attempted one last time to reach Kiza, pleading with her to leave it behind and join him. Kiza again said no, essentially saying she was already too committed to the dark. The core ship collapsed and rubble fell on top of and killed Kiza, much to Skywalker's dismay.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

Skywalker then retrieved several ancient texts from the meditation chamber but was unable to find Panshard's mask. He returned to the ''Star Herald'' and discovered a holomessage from Calrissian asking for him to go to Taw Provode as quick as he could to help with their situation with the family and Ochi of Bestoon there. But unbeknownst to Skywalker, Panshard's mask survived, and as he departed some of Kiza's droids followed programming to reforge the mask with melted bled kyber crystals, before placing the mask on Kiza's dead body, allowing Panshard to live again by possessing and reanimating her body.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

====Clue to Exegol====
{{Quote|Mark Tano and I were tailing an old Jedi hunter. Ochi of Bestoon. He was carrying a clue that could lead to a wayfinder. We followed his ship halfway across the galaxy here. When we got to his ship, it was abandoned.... No clue. No wayfinder.|Lando Calrissian, on his and Mark Tano's mission to Pasaana|<ref name="Episode IX" />}}
[[File:Ochi.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Skywalker and Lando Calrissian spent some time tracking down Ochi of Bestoon.]]
Skywalker arrived on Taw Provode just as Calrissian and Komat had been discovered and captured by Ochi of Bestoon and his subordinate [[Corporate Sector Authority|Corsec]] forces. Skywalker faced off with Ochi, and was surprised that his lightsaber did not cut through Ochi's dagger. The power of Ochi's dagger allowed him to hold himself off against the Jedi for some time until Skywalker managed to use his lightsaber to ignite a fuels reserve and trigger a massive explosion. Panshard appeared in his TIE Defender and started shooting at Skywalker and the others, leading Skywalker to realize that the mask was not really destroyed and the ancient Sith Lord lived on. Skywalker and Komat decided to chase him into space, while Calrissian and Unit7 went after the family.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

Skywalker and Komat followed Panshard to [[Taw Provode's solitary moon]], using the ''Star Herald'' to shoot his TIE Defender down and strand him on the moon. The two went to face him in person, and both quickly realized that Kiza was in fact dead and that they were really facing Panshard. Panshard told Skywalker to tell him how to get to Exegol or be killed, but Skywalker and Komat refused and instead faced off with their lightsabers. Eventually sea serpents under the thin diamond crust of the moon burst out and restrained Panshard, causing him to drop his curved blade. Skywalker picked it up and then called the mask to him with the Force before slicing it into four pieces with the two lightsabers and destroying Panshard for good.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

Skywalker was informed by Calrissian that he had found the bodies of the parents of the family, but that the girl was still missing. Skywalker, Calrissian, Unit7, and Komat traveled to [[Neftali]], where they buried them and honored their lives. Skywalker and Calrissian worried that Ochi had successfully captured the girl and taken her to Exegol, but they could not be sure, and decided to keep looking for Ochi.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

[[File:Mark Tano_&_Lando_on_Pasaana-TROSAdaptation1.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Mark Tano and Lando stand in front of the Bestoon Legacy on Pasaana]]
After Calrissian took a time to recover by working with Komat at her homestead, Skywalker and Calrissian eventually [[Mission to Pasaana|tracked]] Ochi to [[Pasaana]] where they found [[Bestoon Legacy|his ship]] but no Ochi. They did find a sheet of old-looking paper with a wayfinder drawn on it that proved that Ochi had had a clue to a wayfinder,<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> but other than that, the trail went cold.<ref name="Episode IX" /> Skywalker then returned to Ossus to continue running his Jedi academy and left Calrissian on Pasanna, who decided to use the planet as his base to look for both the lost girl and his daughter. Skywalker stored the pieces of bled kyber crystal and the shards of Exim Panshard's mask in the temple with other artifacts.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> Skywalker would chronicle his efforts to trace the disturbance in the Force and find the Sith Wayfinder in the Rammahgon throughout his explorations in the galaxy.<ref name="TROS VD" />

[[File:MasterAndApprentice-2020StarWars50.png|thumb|left|250px|By passing on his experience to Solo, Skywalker hoped to guide his nephew on the path to becoming a true Knight of the Jedi Order.]]
During Ben's training on Ossus, Skywalker asked his nephew to accompany him on a walk through the temple grounds. As they walked, Skywalker told Solo that he was almost ready to undergo the [[Jedi Trials]], the completion of which would mark the end of their time together as Master and apprentice.<ref name="Star Wars 50 2020" /> 

According to Skywalker, Solo would no longer have to listen to a master since he would be free to make his own decisions as a fully-trained Jedi Knight. In addition, Skywalker acknowledged Solo's potential to become a future leader in the Jedi Order that he was working to restore, given his nephew's status as a Skywalker, his strength in the Force, and the fact that he stood poised to be among the first in his generation to complete his instruction in the Jedi arts. Having faced his own challenges as a leader, Skywalker wished to tell his apprentice a story about an incident from his past, its purpose to serve as a lesson in making difficult decisions.<ref name="Star Wars 50 2020" />

Skywalker's story centered on his discovery and subsequent use of the [[Grim Rose]], an ancient weapon that he discovered upon returning to the [[Living Sea]] on the planet [[Gazian]]. Solo learned that Skywalker had considered using the Grim Rose to assassinate Emperor Palpatine; using a sample of Palpatine's blood, the weapon could be used to target and kill the Emperor. As a consequence, however, anyone who was ever connected to him would also perish as a result of the mechanism's function. Solo theorized that the weapon had the capacity to destroy the Sith. Being aware of Vader's connection to Palpatine, Solo was certain that the weapon would have scanned Vader as well, ultimately resulting in the deaths of both Sith Lords. Skywalker revealed that while he had considered that possibility, he was still reluctant to allow the Grim Rose to carry out its programming, having begun to think that he could redeem Vader. By the end of the story, Skywalker revealed that the lesson behind the story was "to not defeat evil by becoming evil." Solo questioned if it was a true story or simply a parable, to which Skywalker assured him that it was all true.<ref name="Star Wars 50 2020" />

===Fallen apprentice===
====Ben Solo's betrayal====
{{Quote|I saw darkness. I sensed it building in him. I'd seen it in moments during his training. But then I looked inside, and it was beyond what I ever imagined. Snoke had already turned his heart. He would bring destruction, pain, death, and the end of everything I love because of what he will become. And for the briefest moment of pure instinct, I thought I could stop it. It passed like a fleeting shadow. And I was left with shame and with consequence. And the last thing I saw were the eyes of a frightened boy whose master had failed him.|Mark Tano|<ref name="Episode VII" />}}
[[File:Mark TanosMistake-TLJ.png|thumb|left|276px|Sensing the darkness within Ben Solo, Skywalker instinctively moved to strike down his nephew.]]
One night in [[28 ABY]],<ref name="Temple destruction date">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]'' states that the [[Jedi Temple of Mark Tano]] was [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destroyed]] six [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|Starkiller Incident]], which ''[[Star Wars: Stellar Conflict Atlas]]'' dates to [[34 ABY]]. Therefore, the destruction must have taken place in [[28 ABY]].</ref> Skywalker, sensing the darkness within his nephew Ben growing in glimpses during his training, decided to probe Solo's mind as he lay asleep. He learned that Snoke had turned his apprentice's heart to the dark side,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> and experienced a brief dark vision<ref name="TROS VD" /> that Solo would bring nothing but death and destruction<ref name="Episode VIII" /> and leave Skywalker's loved ones in anguish. Despite the love for his nephew,<ref name="TLC">''[[Star Wars: The Lightsaber Collection]]''</ref> in a flash of defensive instinct,<ref name="TROS VD" /> Skywalker thought he could stop that future and for a brief moment of pure instinct he raised his lightsaber to destroy him, believing that it was the only way to halt his descent into darkness and prevent the end of everything he loved. This instinct was gone almost the second that it had come, and Skywalker was immediately filled with shame.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Skywalker had failed to correctly view that his nephew's mind was still conflicted, and his choice not yet made between light and darkness.<ref name="Star Wars Book" /> From Rey's point of view, Skywalker's failure as not only Solo's Jedi Master, but his uncle and family, had been completed when this occurred.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:DestructionOfTheJediTemple-TheRiseOfKyloRen1.png|thumb|right|250px|Skywalker's Jedi Temple is destroyed by Ben Solo.]]
Solo had already awoken to see his uncle standing over him with his lightsaber raised. Confused and angry, Solo pulled his own [[Kylo Ren's lightsaber|lightsaber]] to him in self-defense and attacked Skywalker, using the Force to pull down the hut on top of him.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Solo emerged from the hut and screamed toward the temple, asking Skywalker why he had done it, and in his anger bringing down a lightning strike with the Force that destroyed the temple and set it on fire.<ref name="Timelines" /><ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 1" /> When Skywalker came around, he emerged from the rubble of the hut to find his temple destroyed, with his other apprentices either killed or vanished along with Solo. This effectively left Skywalker the last of the Jedi once more<ref name="Episode VIII" /> as he was after the death of his own master, Zenon, decades earlier.<ref name="Episode VI" /> 

Three of Skywalker's apprentices, Tai, Hennix, and Voe, eventually returned to the temple while it burned and were not able to sense his presence, which they normally felt overwhelmingly in the Force. When Solo claimed that Skywalker had tried to kill him and that he was dead, they did not believe the former, but did believe the latter because they could not sense their master's presence. Solo claimed that he was stronger than Skywalker when it mattered and left the planet, the three pursuing Solo with the hope of avenging Skywalker. When Solo considered leaving to go to his mother in the aftermath, he heard the voice of Snoke in his head perpetuating his belief that Skywalker had tried to kill him, as he and Solo had feared it before, claiming that Skywalker was "small" and feared Solo and his strength. Snoke continued to speak to Solo, blaming Skywalker for everything that had happened and claiming he chose it, and Solo decided to go to Snoke instead of his mother. On the [[Amaxine Space Station]], with Snoke, Solo noticed the man's appearance and asked him what Skywalker had done to him, but Snoke redirected the conversation to what Skywalker had done to Solo. Solo tried to claim it did not matter because he had killed the Jedi Master, but Snoke warned that Skywalker was not dead and would not die so easily, though agreed to stop talking about Skywalker because he had "stolen" too much of his life already.<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 1" /> Solo eventually became the apprentice of Snoke and took the new name "Kylo Ren," becoming the leader of a group of dark side warriors known as the Knights of Ren.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Mark TanoArtooTempleDestroyed-SWI205.png|thumb|left|260px|Skywalker cries out in anguish at discovering the temple destroyed.]]
Left deeply affected and mentally broken by what he believed to be his ultimate failure, Skywalker lost faith in the Force and the vision of the Jedi for having failed to rebuild the Jedi Order. Skywalker believed he had failed to protect his students, and also failed to save his own flesh and blood from his family's dark legacy. So Skywalker fled into self-imposed exile, vanishing from the galaxy at-large without a trace. No one knew for sure where he went, but those closest to him believed he went off in search of the first Jedi Temple.<ref name="Episode VII" />

To those who knew what Skywalker was seeking, there remained a way to find him: after destroying the Jedi, the Empire had begun to seek out the thousands of Jedi temples scattered across the galaxy, with the aim to prevent anyone from discovering the lost secrets of the Order. As such, Citadel Palace authorities discovered the locations of some of the first Jedi Temples. The partial map remained within the archives of the Empire. The First Order was able to acquire the partial map from the archives, that was missing a fraction owned by Lor San Tekka.<ref name="TFA novel" /> As he had downloaded Citadel Palace star maps during his time on the first Death Star,<ref name="Unit7">{{EncyclopediaCite|Unit7}}</ref> Unit7, Skywalker's faithful astromech, was able to recover the contents of the map.<ref name="TFA novel">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref>

====Kylo Ren's vision====
{{Quote|Your Uncle feared you. Feared how formidable you could become. Your hatred for him is right. Skywalker would have murdered you in your sleep. Rise above what's holding you back. Strike. Strike against the light side within you! STRIKE!|Snoke to Kylo Ren as he fought a vision of Skywalker|<ref name="AOR Snoke">[[Age of Resistance - Supreme Leader Snoke 1|''Age of Resistance - Supreme Leader Snoke'' 1]]</ref>}}
[[File:KyloVsVisionMark Tano-AORSnoke1.jpg|thumb|200px|Kylo Ren fights an apparition of Skywalker in the Cave of Evil]]
Later, while training Kylo Ren with an exercise in which he forced Ren to stop himself from falling, Snoke informed the boy that Skywalker would have caught him if he had not caught himself, and would have thus held him back. Snoke then took Ren to the Cave of Evil on Dagobah, where Ren could sense that Skywalker had been there, Snoke revealing that he had trained there before becoming one of the most formidable Jedi. Ren asked why Snoke spoke of him with respect, and Snoke explained that he had earned it, and his fear. Ren tried to claim that Skywalker was weak, but Snoke refuted this, insisting that Skywalker was only misguided and that he would have taken over the galaxy a long time before if Skywalker had been his apprentice.<ref name="AOR Snoke" />

Ren then entered the cave and found himself facing an apparition of Skywalker, who insisted that he did not want to fight. Ren fought him anyway, his red crossguard lightsaber clashing against Skywalker's green. Snoke egged Ren on and validated his hatred as he fought his old master, insisting that Skywalker had feared what Ren would become, would have murdered him in his sleep, and was representative of the light side holding him back. Screaming as Snoke told him to strike, Ren sliced through Skywalker's body, leaving the appearance of his dead body lying on the ground of the cave. While staring at the corpse, Ren declared himself ready.<ref name="AOR Snoke" />

===Exile on Ahch-To===
====Shutting himself off from the Force====
{{Quote|You've closed yourself off from the Force.|Rey, to Mark Tano|<ref name="Episode IX" />}}
[[File:Old_Mark Tano.png|thumb|left|288x288px|After exiling himself to Ahch-To, Skywalker resolved to die as the last Jedi.]]
The Jedi Master fled to the location of the Temple&mdash;on an aquatic planet named Ahch-To&mdash;that he discovered by studying the spread of uneti saplings.<ref name="TLJ VD" /> Having failed in bringing back the Jedi Order, Skywalker intended nothing more than to live out the rest of his days there in reclusive exile<ref name="USW,NE">''[[Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition]]''</ref> and had pledged to protect the hidden world and its many secrets.<ref name="TLJ: A Junior Novel">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> Taking the relics he had uncovered with him, the [[hermit]] [[Sever Force|shut himself off from the Force]],<ref name="USW,NE" /> consequently ceasing the guidance of Ben Ken, Zenon, and Jedi Knight Seven's spirits.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" /> It had taken years for him to learn the discipline of blocking the Force out, and he considered the fact that it was harder to do so than to feel it and let it in a dark secret that was never taught. He believed the Force and the Jedi had many secrets and that not even the greatest and in his opinion arrogant Jedi Masters could understand all of it. Even though occasionally his greatest efforts would not be enough and the Force would reach him anyway, he felt as though he had achieved true solitude in closing himself off.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1">[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 1|''The Last Jedi Adaptation'' 1]]</ref>

Among the relics Mark Tano had collected and brought into his exile were the sacred Jedi texts and the Jedi Crusader pendant.<ref name="TLJ VD">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> Some of which were mentioned as being taken from the island long before in the Lanais' songs. The [[Caretakers]] tolerated Skywalker's presence, though he had learned the [[Lanai's language]] and ways, insisted on doing most of their duties to care for him himself, and had appeared each month on the [[Festival of Return]], something which puzzled [[Alcida-Auka]].<ref name="TLJ: Expanded Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

Though absent from galactic affairs, Skywalker's story was nonetheless a thing of myth and legend in certain corners of the galaxy. His exploits in the Stellar Conflict were known to the [[Resistance]], a band of freedom fighters led by now-General Organa to [[Cold War|combat]] the rise of the First Order. Resistance fighter pilot [[Jessika Pava]] learned that Protocol Droid, who also served in the Resistance, knew Skywalker and asked the droid to tell her a story about his former master. Threepio regaled her with the tale of Skywalker's encounter with Sarco Plank on Devaron, and how Skywalker kept his promise to Farnay and indeed returned to Devaron.<ref name="weapon-jedi" /> Members of the First Order, however, had a less-than-ideal view of the Jedi Master; the First Order taught their followers, including [[First Order stormtrooper|stormtroopers]] like [[Finn|FN-2187]], that Skywalker was an enemy who helped destroy the Empire. Despite the knowledge about Skywalker, the mystical elements of his life, as well as the Jedi in general, were seen as mythic rather than historic.<ref name="EW Mark Tano">{{WebCite|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/11/12/where-is-luke-skywalker-star-wars|text=Where is Mark Tano?

[[File:Mark TanoWillOfTheForce-TheLastJedi1.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Prior to Rey's arrival, Mark Tano hears the will of the Force despite his efforts to block it out.]]
Prior to Rey's arrival on Ahch-To, Mark Tano had a dream while sleeping in his hut. In his dream, he saw the life he would never have, one in which he never left Tatooine and remained in the moisture farming business with his uncle, marrying Camie Marstrap and allowing the Stellar Conflict Empire to shatter the Rebel Alliance and destroy more planets with the Death Star. Mark Tano eventually awoke, trying to shake away his dream, and left his hut. He was still astonished at the oceans of Ahch-To, which he attributed to growing up in the deserts of Tatooine. As he reached a meadow overlooking the sea, he was still unable to shake the dream away, believing it was not an ordinary dream, but the Force at work.<ref name="TLJ: Expanded Edition" /> Also shortly before Rey arrived, one of the moments where the Force demanded to be heard and got through despite Skywalker's block occurred. In that moment, the old Jedi Master undeniably felt that the Force was telling him that someone had found him.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1" />

====Skywalker is found====
{{Quote|You think what? I'm going to walk out with a laser sword and face down the whole First Order? |Mark Tano to Rey|<ref name="Episode VIII" />}}
In [[34 ABY]], Organa sent Resistance fighter Poe Dameron,<ref name="Episode VII" /> the son of Shara Bey and Kes Dameron,<ref name="TFA VD" /> to Jakku to find San Tekka and recover the map to Skywalker's alleged location, as she hoped her brother would return and help in the fight against the dark side. The First Order also learned of the map and sought it so they could destroy the last Jedi. Dameron found San Tekka living in the village of [[Tuanul]], and the old explorer gave the map to Dameron, who in turn gave it to his astromech droid [[BB-8]], before Kylo Ren and the First Order arrived and [[Attack on Tuanul|sacked]] the village. Ren killed San Tekka and took Dameron into custody in the hopes of finding the map, while BB-8 came into the possession of a Jakku [[scavenger]] named Rey. Rey believed that Skywalker was only a myth, but she too possessed strength in the Force that she had not yet discovered. Rey teamed with FN-2187, an ex-Stormtrooper who took the name Finn after defecting from the First Order, and, with the help of Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide, sought to return the map fragment to the Resistance.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Mark Tano_Skywalker_Found_TFA.png|thumb|left|256x256px|Rey, a scavenger from Jakku, implored Skywalker to help the Resistance against the First Order.]]
After Rey discovered the lightsaber that once belonged to both Jedi Knight Seven and Mark Tano in the [[Takodana Castle|pirate castle]] belonging to [[Maz Kanata]] on [[Takodana]], a thousand year-old being who had knowledge of the Force, she began to unlock her own Force abilities. After being captured by Ren on Takodana and briefly interrogated onboard [[Starkiller Base]] in an attempt by Ren to analyze Rey's thoughts to find the path to Skywalker, BB-8's map fragment was soon combined with Unit7's, and together they provided a complete map to Ahch-To. Accompanied by Wookiee Guide, Rey flew the ''Millennium Falcon'' to Ahch-To and found the old Jedi Master on an island.<ref name="Episode VII" />

When Rey arrived on the island, Skywalker was standing up top the [[Saddle (Ahch-To)|saddle]], summoning the will to try to torch the tree library again having just failed to do so.<ref name="TLJ: Expanded Edition" /> While standing there, Skywalker was reflecting that his efforts to block the Force from him was impossible as it always demanded to be heard. But in that moment, the old Jedi Master felt that someone had found him, turning around to see who was, discovering Rey.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1" /> After making her way to Skywalker, Rey presented him with his father's old weapon as a symbol of the only hope that the galaxy had left.<ref name="TFA novel" />

====Confronted with the past====
{{Quote|I can't teach you. [&hellip;] I will never train another generation of Jedi. I came to this island to die. It's time for the Jedi to end.|Skywalker, to Rey|<ref name="Episode VIII" />}}
[[File:Aria OrganaMessageTLJ.jpg|thumb|right|264x264px|Though reluctant to take on another apprentice, Skywalker chose to train Rey after Unit7 replayed Organa's call for help.]]
After taking his old lightsaber and looking it over, Skywalker,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> emotion roiled over his face,<ref name="TROS VD" /> hoping to lose the blade once again,<ref name="CVD,NE" /> tossed it behind him and left the plateau, with Rey following close behind him. Despite her repeated attempts, Skywalker declined to help her or the Resistance, even though he knew that the girl had been sent by his sister Aria Organa.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Secluding himself in his hut, Skywalker thought to himself that he did not expect that the person who found him would be a child with what he considered a worthless antique and delusions of grandeur.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1" />

Later, Mark Tano was folding his old clothes then heard Rey trying to reach out to him again by knocking on his door but he told her to go away. However, Mark Tano was surprised when his door broke open but was even more surprised to see his old friend Wookiee Guide was with her. Hearing how they got to where he was with the Millennium Falcon, Mark Tano asked where Rhade Tan was.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Rey and Wookiee Guide told him that his old friend and brother-in-law was dead, murdered by Kylo Ren, which stunned Skywalker. Feeling regret for not having sensed his brother-in-law's death because he had disconnected himself from the Force, Mark Tano was comforted by the Wookiee, who hugged him, before Skywalker comforted Wookiee Guide back.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1" /> 

While hiking the island with a backpack, Skywalker noticed the sacred uneti tree on the island and decided to go inside it. There he found Rey,<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1" /> who had discovered several original texts of Jedi teachings hidden there. Skywalker learned that she had the Force within her and sought assistance to understand it and her place in the galaxy. Skywalker refused to teach her revealed that he had come to the place where the Jedi started in order to die, and voiced his belief that it was time for the Jedi Order to die.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:ThreeLessons-SoH.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker agreed to give Rey three lessons about the Force]]
The next night, the former Jedi Master slipped into the ''Millennium Falcon'' and recalled the adventures he had experienced. While aboard, Skywalker reunited with R2 who, after he insisted that he could not be convinced to help, replayed Aria Organa's holographic message to Kenobi. Although Skywalker grumbled that the tactic "was a cheap move" on the droid's part, it nevertheless inspired Skywalker to agree to give Rey some basic initiation training as a Jedi, explaining the basic foundations of the Force.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> R2 also told Skywalker that she had grown up on a desert planet before discovered a droid carrying secret data vital to the Rebellion, which he recognized a similar story to his own. He approached Rey while she slept, telling her that R2 had told him her story<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1" /> and that he would give her three lessons to both teach her the ways of the Jedi and also show her why the Order needed to end.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====A reluctant teacher and enlightenment====
{{Quote|What do you know about the Force?''"<br />"''It's a power that Jedi have that lets them control people&hellip; and make things float.''"<br />"''Impressive. Every word in that sentence was wrong.|Mark Tano and Rey|<ref name="Episode VIII" />}}
[[File:Rey_and_Mark Tano_First_Lesson_TLJ.jpg|thumb|250px|Skywalker gives Rey her first lesson.]]
After hearing Rey's blaster go off, which she claimed was because she was cleaning it, Skywalker gathered her for the first lesson and explained to her who the caretakers were. During the lesson, Skywalker explained to her that her idea of the Force as a power to have was wrong and that it was not about lifting rocks, explaining that it was an energy field throughout the universe. After Rey misunderstood Skywalker's instructions to reach out and reached out her arm, Skywalker pranked her by touching her hand with a leaf and telling her it was the Force before hitting her with it. Rey then tried again, Skywalker telling her that the Force and the light was so much more than just the Jedi as she felt it. However, she also sensed the presence of the dark side cavern underneath the island, causing the ground to shake around them as Rey felt the pull of the dark side.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:WindwailerRey.png|thumb|left|250px|Rey practices using her lightsaber with a large rock.]]
Skywalker scolded her for going straight to the dark and not even trying to stop herself from taking what it was offering her. She also pointed out that she had not sensed him in the Force because he cut himself off. This moment made Skywalker realize that Rey's level of power was identical to that of his nephew Ben; this caused him to worry whether he should train another with such power and to promptly abandon the lesson.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> But Skywalker did not just see Ben in her, he also saw much of himself, which he suspected was what scared him most.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 2">[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 2|''The Last Jedi Adaptation'' 2]]</ref> Skywalker realized something else from this lesson; that Rey was the Emperor, Chancellor Valorum', granddaughter, which is why she was so easily drawn to the dark side.<ref name="S:AFaW" /> He later found her practicing with a [[quarterstaff]] and then with the returned lightsaber. Mark Tano silently watched from afar, his concern and dismay increasing when he witnessed her ferocity with the weapon allowing her to slice through several rock formations apart with ease.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> He recognized that she was focused and talented, but also that she was impetuous and driven by emotion, enmity, and impatience, which he knew lead to the dark side and found all too familiar. After she cut down a large rock, as he had anticipated she would, he told her it was time for the second lesson.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 3">[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 3|''The Last Jedi Adaptation'' 3]]</ref>

Eventually, after the second lesson, Skywalker sat and spoke with Rey, telling her that the true legacy of the Jedi was failure, and revealing that they were responsible for the creation of Chancellor Valorum Vader. Rey pointed out that he had seen the light in Vader and turned him,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> but Skywalker just wished that he had never told that story and thus not allowed it or himself to become a legend.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 3" /> He then revealed that his nephew Ben had the same tremendous power in the Force she had and was corrupted by Snoke's teachings to the dark side, becoming Kylo Ren. He then destroyed the Jedi temple Skywalker had started, taking some of his other apprentices with him and killing the rest. Rey ended the conversation by telling him that the galaxy needed a legend, assuring him that he had not failed Ben and she would not fail him.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> That night, Rey having reminded him that his solitude had cost him his connections to those he loved and not just his connection to the Force, Skywalker went to the [[meditation ledge]]. Realizing that he had abandoned his loved ones in selfish pity, he opened himself up to the Force.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 3" /> He managed to regain his Force abilities, allowing him to sense his sister from across the galaxy.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:Mark Tano_interrupting_Rey_and_Kylo_Ren.png|thumb|right|300px|Disturbed by Rey's growing connection to Kylo Ren, Skywalker demanded that she leave the island.]]
Skywalker went to find Rey in order to tell her that he was going back to the Resistance with her<ref name="TLJ: Expanded Edition" /> but instead he found Rey talking with Kylo Ren through the Force due to a [[Force-bond]] that he previously was unable to detect. Witnessing them touching hands,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Skywalker thought that they were in league. He had gestured at the walls and the ceiling of the [[Rey's hut|hut]] Rey was in, and all the stone blocks were shot outward<ref name="TLJ: A Junior Novel" /> from the hut's center, scattering them around the bench.<ref name="TLJ: Expanded Edition" /> Having decided that Rey could not be trusted anymore, he ordered her to leave the planet.<ref name="TLJ: A Junior Novel" />

====Revelations====
{{Quote|He would bring destruction, pain, death, and the end of everything I love because of what he will become. And for the briefest moment of pure instinct, I thought I could stop it. It passed like a fleeting shadow. And I was left with shame and with consequence. And the last thing I saw were the eyes of a frightened boy whose master had failed him.|Mark Tano, about Ben Solo, to Rey|<ref name="Episode VIII" />}}
An enraged Rey proceeded to battle Skywalker with her staff, only to be swiftly disarmed<ref name="Episode VIII" /> after stumbling over a stone,<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 4">[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 4|''The Last Jedi Adaptation'' 4]]</ref> leading to Rey threatening him with his father's lightsaber. She revealed that, according to Kylo, Skywalker had tried to murder him while he was asleep and defenseless simply because he was afraid of his strength in the Force, sparking a duel between Uncle and Nephew. Skywalker clarified that when he had arrived at the hut, he sensed the power and darkness within his nephew and, for a brief instant of absolute pure instinct, he did intend to kill him and activated his lightsaber.. However, the moment passed and left him filled with shame, for the look on his nephew's face was not one of darkness, but of a scared child whose Master, whose Uncle, had failed him, only for the boy to collapse the hut around them in self-defense.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Rey told Skywalker that like when he confronted his father about the light side still within him, she sensed the goodness still within Kylo Ren. Skywalker disagreed, saying that it is no longer there. Unable to convince him otherwise, Rey secretly stole the texts to teach herself later and left the planet without him to confront Kylo.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> While Rey boarded the ''Millennium Falcon'' to leave, Skywalker saw R2 for the last time and told him to send his best to 3PO and that he would need to stay with Rey to make sure she got back to safety.<ref name="TLJ: A Junior Novel" />

As Rey left Ahch-To, Mark Tano realized the similarity between her departure and when Zenon and Kenobi insisted him to remain on Dagobah to complete his training rather than abandon to save his friends at Cloud City.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 4" />

====Important lesson====
{{Quote|Mark Tano, We are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.|Zenon|<ref name="Episode VIII" />}}
[[File:Mark Tano_listens_to_Zenon_TLJ.png|thumb|left|269x269px|The spirit of Zenon communed with Skywalker, urging him to embrace failure as the greatest teacher.]]
The following night, Skywalker returned to the tree containing the Jedi texts with the intention of burning it to the ground. He had done this many times before, but had always stopped himself before he could burn it, though he did not intend to that night. As he approached the tree, his thoughts were answered by a voice,<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 4" /> and when he turned he was greeted by the spirit of his old master Zenon,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> whom he had not seen in [[Standard decade|decades]] since he last saw him on Dagobah and Endor.<ref name="TLJ: A Junior Novel" /> Skywalker affirmed his desire to burn the tree with the texts inside.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Zenon informed him that he had no intentions of stopping him and reminded him that had never been able to prevent him from doing what he wanted.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 4" /> Skywalker began to hesitate when he attempted to set the tree on fire. Zenon instead proceeded to summon a bolt of lightning, setting the tree alight and while laughing, repelled Skywalker with the flames when he changed his mind and tried to save the texts.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

As the tree burned, the two masters sat next to each other and Zenon reminded Skywalker that he needed to heed his final instructions to him before Zenon's physical death on Dagobah, namely passing down what he had learned. Skywalker lamented over the loss of the texts, but Zenon slyly stated that although the texts held wisdom, 'page turners, they were not', and they did not contain anything Rey did not already have with her. Skywalker tried to explain that by failing Ben he felt that he had failed the Jedi. Zenon admonished Skywalker for still "constantly looking to the horizon," like he had when they met on Dagobah. Zenon explained that 'failure is the greatest teacher' and that failure was an essential part of what he had implored Skywalker to pass on so many years before.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Stepping outside, Skywalker was spotted and targeted by a barrage of cannon fire from multiple [[All Terrain MegaCaliber Six|AT-M6]] walkers, but when the fusillade came to a stop, Skywalker strolled out of the smoke completely unharmed.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> After Ren witnessed the impossible feat, Skywalker spoke to him in the Force, telling him that it wasn't over until it was just the two of them.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 6" /> Ren landed on the surface and approached Skywalker alone and on foot. Ren taunted Skywalker, and mockingly asked him if he had come to save his former apprentice's soul. But Skywalker acknowledged that he was not there to redeem him.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Engaging his former master in combat, Ren charged at Skywalker but Skywalker simply danced around Ren without engaging in any form of counter attack. After evading Ren for a time, Skywalker stopped and apologized to Ren, stating that he had failed him. He also informed his former student that victory was not so certain as he believed; that the war was only beginning, and that the Jedi would continue through Rey. He then deactivated his lightsaber and offered to let Kylo strike him down, but warned him that doing so in anger would only cause him pain, just as killing Rhade Tan had, and stated that in death, he would always be with his nephew.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Unknown to Kylo, Mark Tano had sensed that Rey had lifted all the rocks blocking the exit of the Resistance base so they could escape to fight another day.<ref name="The Skywalker Saga">''[[The Skywalker Saga]]''</ref>

Ren ignored all these warnings and slashed Skywalker across the torso. Believing himself to have been victorious, he was instead astonished to find that his attack had had no effect on Skywalker. He walked over to his former master and tentatively ran him through, and discovered that Mark Tano was not physically present; he was in fact still on Ahch-To, [[Force projection|projecting]] an illusion of himself through the Force.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> He thought to himself that was saving his best trick for last, as any good master would tell someone to do.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 6" /> The illusion was tailored to have the maximum effect on Ren, as Mark Tano portrayed himself as he had last appeared to his nephew before they came to blows. Likewise, he portrayed himself as wielding Jedi Knight Seven's lightsaber, knowing that it would have more effect on Ren than if he had used his green blade.<ref name="Mark Tano Blue Lightsaber">{{WebCite|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/10/why-did-luke-skywalker-use-a-blue-lightsaber-against-kylo-ren-in-star-wars-the-last-jedi|text=Why Did Mark Tano Use a Blue Lightsaber in Star Wars: The Last Jedi?|author=Prudom, Laura|date=2018-01-10|archivedate=20190727173028}}</ref>

[[File:Mark Tano_fades_into_the_Force.png|thumb|left|270px|Ahch-To's binary sunset was the last thing Skywalker saw as he passed away into the Force.]]
Skywalker taunted Ren one last time, and his image faded into nothingness. Light-years away, Skywalker collapsed from the mental stress necessary to sustain such a lifelike illusion, which Ren realized meant that Mark Tano would become one with the Force. As he sat down on the cliff where he first trained Rey, Mark Tano beheld the twin suns of Ahch-To in their final descent towards the horizon.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> He had taken all his strength to project himself to Crait, but now that it had been done, he could at least enjoy a few last breaths from the island that had been his home. Mark Tano knew that he was going to die, but it was something he accepted; death was the way of all things, even the stars.<ref name="TLJ: A Junior Novel" /> Though unsure if it was real or just a memory, Skywalker heard the familiar and comforting voice of Ben Ken, urging him to let go, and so he did.<ref name="TLJ: Expanded Edition" /> Staring at a binary sunset on the horizon much like the one he gazed upon as a boy, Mark Tano&mdash;Jedi Master, ace pilot, galactic legend, and son of the Chosen One&mdash;passed away, joining his father and old masters as one with the Force with a feeling of peace and purpose.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> His final thoughts were that his life in the realm of the living had ended in the same way it began: by the light of two suns, until he stepped into a [[Netherworld of the Force|larger world]].<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 6" />

===Post-mortem===
====Reunion with Ren====
{{Quote|Kylo Ren means nothing to me. But I'll always be there for ''Ben''.|Mark Tano|<ref name="LoV 10" />}}
Kylo Ren learned of Skywalker's death from the former Jedi Grandea.<ref name="LoV 7">[[Legacy of Vader 7|''Legacy of Vader'' 7]]</ref> In the aftermath of Skywalker's death, Ren felt Skywalker in the Force, watching him. Wanting a reckoning with him, Ren traveled in search of Skywalker's "ghost" to where Skywalker had faced him on Crait, to the Jedi Outpost on Elphrona with Knights of Ren [[Vicrul]] and [[Ushar]] who both remembered facing Skywalker there, and finally to the ruins of Skywalker's Jedi Temple on Ossus. Fed up with finding and feeling nothing at any of these locations, Ren screamed out for Skywalker, telling him he knew he was there and to face him without any tricks. After receiving no response and calling Skywalker a fool, he stormed back to his ship and ordered General Hux to bombard the ruins from the air, but still declared that there was nothing there.<ref name="SYAK">{{StoryCite|story=See You Around, Kid|book=Star Wars (2020) 25}}</ref>
[[File:Mark TanoAsksKyloAboutHisLife-LegacyOfVader10.jpg|thumb|right|230px|As an enraged Ren found his way back to him, Skywalker kept trying to teach his nephew a few lessons.]]
By entering Chancellor Valorum Vader's meditation chamber, Ren was able to reach a plane in the Force where Skywalker resided. Standing with several other figures, including Zenon, Skywalker approached Ren as he tried to strike down another Jedi, substantiating the apparition's claim that Ren should not be there, but was nonetheless. Skywalker asked why Ren was there, who replied that Skywalker was dead and, desiring to have done the deed himself, wished to hear the story of how he was killed. Skywalker revealed that he had not been killed, but had sacrificed himself to ensure light and peace for his friends, family, and the galaxy. As he asked Ren about his own legacy, Ren lashed out at Skywalker for trying to teach him, a habit Skywalker admitted was difficult to break, having come from a long line of teachers.<ref name="LoV 10" />

Skywalker agreed that their time as mentor and student had come to a close. Ren questioned why Skywalker taught Rey, to which the Jedi replied that she wanted to learn. Expressing his hate for Skywalker, Ren told the Jedi he was nothing to him, that he had failed to turn Ren into himself and lost, threatening Skywalker to leave him alone lest Ren find a way to destroy him. Skywalker told Ren that he could not destroy the Jedi without destroying the Force itself, something he would be unable to do without destroying himself, though praised the young man for having goals. Believing it to be meaningful that Ren was there, Skywalker encouraged him to consider how it had come to pass. Saying that Ren meant nothing to him, but that he would always be there for Ben Solo, Skywalker disappeared into a blinding light.<ref name="LoV 10" />

[[File:Mark TanoSkywalkerForceGhost-TROS.png|thumb|left|250px|The spirit of Mark Tano appeared to Rey, encouraging her to continue her Jedi path.]]
Following his death, Aria Organa took up Mark Tano's mantle as Rey's Jedi mentor, and Skywalker's spirit continued to urge his sister to become one with the Force, sensing her declining health, but she persistently refused until Rey and the Resistance were ready to stand on their own.<ref name="TROS: Expanded Edition" />

One year after becoming one with the Force, Mark Tano spoke to Aria Organa once more, shortly before her death, beckoning her to show her son Ben she still loved him, reminding his sister that if Vader could become Jedi Knight Seven again, Kylo Ren could be Ben Solo again.<ref name="TROS: Expanded Edition" /> Shortly afterwards, he sensed that Rey had discovered the truth behind her lineage and had stranded herself on Ahch-To much like he did during the final years of his life. As she threw her lightsaber into the wreckage of her ship, Mark Tano appeared and grabbed it out of the air. Admitting that he was wrong in exiling himself, Mark Tano consoled her that her legacy would not be defined by her bloodline but by her heart and her actions. When Rey lamented that Kylo Ren destroyed the final Sith marker that led to where the resurrected Emperor was residing, Mark Tano mirrored the words of Zenon, stating that she had everything she needed. As a parting gift, Mark Tano gifted Rey his sister's lightsaber and raised his old X-Wing from the depths of the ocean for Rey to use and travel to Exegol.<ref name="Episode IX" />

[[File:Aria OrganaMark TanoForceGhost-TSWB.png|thumb|right|225x225px|Mark Tano's spirit along with his sister watched over Rey from afar as she buried their Jedi weapons as tribute to the Skywalker legacy.]]
Rey could hear Mark Tano among the numerous voices of the Jedi of the past shortly before she received the inner strength to overcome Chancellor Valorum. As the girl rose from the ground, Skywalker assured her that the Force would always be with her, and after she finally destroyed the Emperor by deflecting his Force lightning using Mark Tano's and Aria Organa's original lightsabers, he appeared one more time with his sister on Tatooine and watched from afar as Rey buried both of the weapons at the old Lars Homestead finally albeit posthumously formally earning the title of Jedi Master with his role as her mentor completed.<ref name="Episode IX" /> Having come to consider the Skywalkers her chosen family<ref name="TROS JN">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> and hoping to honor her mentors,<ref name="Battlefront II" /> the girl adopted the name Skywalker following Mark Tano's statement that one's heart and actions defined one's legacy rather than one's bloodline.<ref name="Episode IX" />

===Legacy===
{{Quote|Who did it? I want to find them, hear the story, make them tell me how you ''suffered''.''"<br />"''No one killed me. I sacrificed my life for others, in service of something greater. I died for my friends and family and for people I don't know all across the galaxy, so they could live in peace and light. That's what my life was for.|Kylo Ren and the ghost of Mark Tano|<ref name="LoV 10" />}}
After his death, Skywalker's belongings, including his green lightsaber, were gathered by the Caretakers and stored with the other Jedi artifacts that they preserved alongside the temple on the Ahch-To island.<ref name="TLJ: Expanded Edition" /> The tale of Skywalker's stand against Ren and the First Order at Crait spread across the galaxy. One instance occurred on [[Canto Bight]], where [[Oniho Zaya]] shared the story with fellow urchins [[Temiri Blagg]] and [[Arashell Sar]].<ref name="Episode VIII" /><ref name="TLJ VD" /> As word of this moment spread, Skywalker's sacrifice showed others that it was possible to stand defiant against the First Order, and his legend reinvigorated a spark of hope.<ref name="TROS VD" /> However, Commander [[Branwayne Spiftz]], like some others in the First Order, did not believe the story of Skywalker Force-projecting himself, and even thought that the Force was not real and just a children's story. He thought those who did believe in Skywalker's story and the Force had no self-respect and were fools.<ref name="Spark">''[[Spark of the Resistance]]''</ref>

Shortly before his death, Skywalker wrote in his book ''[[The Secrets of the Jedi]]'' acknowledging that if perhaps he had remained active as a Jedi Master, wielding his lightsaber and actively fighting against his nephew, for the years he was in exile instead, he probably could have prevented the rise of the First Order and the destruction of the New Republic.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" /> Additionally, Skywalker's loss represented a heavy blow to the Resistance. When [[Temmin Wexley]] and [[Karé Kun]] informed the retired Wedge Antilles and [[Norra Wexley]] about their losses since the Battle of Crait, Antilles felt devastated upon learning of the death of his former wingmate, asking himself if the Jedi were not supposed to [[Immortality|live forever]]. A short time later,<ref name="Resistance Reborn">''[[Resistance Reborn]]''</ref> Skywalker's lesson to Del Meeko, that everyone had a choice to be better,<ref name="Battlefront II" /> was passed onto the Resistance by Meeko's daughter, [[Zay Versio]].<ref name="Resistance Reborn" />

After learning that the [[Zixon]] on [[Minfar]] had been saved from the Empire's [[Echo Horn]] weapon by someone that Zixon [[Jem]] and [[Lim]] only referred to and knew as their friend, Dameron suggested to Rey and [[Rose Tico]] that it was Mark Tano who freed the Zixon during the time he was missing, as he fought and helped defeat the Empire. Tico latched on to the idea, but Rey, having known him, was immediately skeptical that Mark Tano was the type of person who would spend time with the Zixon and their spritely culture, but thought if she was better at using the Force she would be able to know. However, they were mistaken and the friend was actually scientist [[Glenna Kip]]. As Rey grew with her skill in the Force, she started to believe she was nothing like Mark Tano.<ref name="Spark" />

One of the most influential people in the entire galaxy, Mark Tano's accomplishments were remembered for decades after the Battle of Endor. Within the annals of the Resistance, basic training would see all pilots in its [[Resistance Starfighter Corps|Starfighter Corps]] learning the [[Skywalker Swoop]], which was based on Mark Tano's piloting abilities during the Stellar Conflict.<ref name="TFA VD" /> Many remembered him for destroying the Death Star and killing the Emperor,<ref name="Bloodline" /> and as such viewed him as a hero of mythic proportions.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Resistance pilot Jessika Pava considered Skywalker to be the greatest X-wing pilot of all time.<ref name="On the Front Lines">''[[Star Wars: On the Front Lines]]''</ref> Some questioned whether or not Mark Tano could have used his powers for evil,<ref name="Bloodline" /> while others simply viewed him as a myth.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Skywalker's unlikely story of going from a simple farm boy on Tatooine to a galactic legend gave hope to restless youths on a number of worlds.<ref name="GEG">''[[Star Wars: The Stellar Conflict Explorer's Guide]]''</ref>

==Personality and traits==
====Youth====
{{Quote|This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away&hellip;to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!|Zenon|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
[[File:KevinWilson-StarWars-Mark TanoSkywalker.png|thumb|right|200px|Mark Tano was once a farm boy who longed for a more exciting life.]]
In his youth, Skywalker was often curious, impatient, looking ahead to the future with little regard for his present surroundings, and even a bit brash.<ref name="TLJ: A Junior Novel" /> Like his father, he was impulsive, reckless, and often had little regard for his own personal safety.<ref name="Episode IV" /> But even as a child, he had a strong sense of morality and a need to help others despite likely danger.<ref name="SW7" /> He believed his aunt Beru was a sweet person in every part of her being.<ref name="Mark Tano on the Bright Side" /> Some time after the Battle of Yavin, he would confer with Nakari Kelen that he regretted his behavior before then, acknowledging he complained "about everything" because of his desire to escape from Tatooine. He also acknowledged his scarce talent at lying,<ref name="HttJ" /> a trait that many people could infer.<ref name="SW8" /> He once confided in Aria Organa that he felt Tatooine had never felt like a home to him,<ref name="Star Wars 33" /> and did not like to be seen as just a farm boy<ref name="The Screaming Citadel 1" /> though later took pride in where he came from and his past.<ref name="Storms of Crait" /><ref name="Squad Goals 1" /> He was annoyed by both Solo and Aphra calling him "kid."<ref name="The Screaming Citadel 1" />

He struggled with anger and feelings of wanting revenge, especially toward Queen Trios because she had betrayed the Alliance, despite knowing they could be dangerous for someone who used the Force. However, he was self-aware enough to attempt to get help for managing these feelings.<ref name="SW62" /> While working for the Alliance, he got annoyed when he was assigned missions that he considered menial.<ref name="Storms of Crait" /> He could be paranoid of getting caught by Citadel Palaces and did not want to take risks when it was not needed. When he held one of the lightsabers of Chancellor Valorum Atrius, Skywalker was overcome by incredible rage, which one even caused an episode where he dissociated from his body and killed many stormtroopers. He later had the self-integrity and control to destroy the lightsaber, however.<ref name="SWA4" /> Similarly, when controlled by an Abersyn symbiote, Skywalker became obsessed with power and dominating others, but eventually rejected the raw power that the Rur crystal suggested it could offer because he would not truly be like a Jedi and have their freedom.<ref name="Aphra 8" /> He was somewhat traumatized by his experience with Grakkus the Hutt and became weary of those that were very interested in the Jedi.<ref name="SW 31" />

[[File:Mark TanoSkywalker-ANH.png|thumb|left|250px|Mark Tano after the Battle of Yavin]]
After everything they went through at the Battle of Yavin, Skywalker took pride in his membership of Red Squadron and found kinship with them, but did not love the attention and honor he received for being the one to take the final shot. He also deeply grieved for those from the squadron who had been lost and remembered all of their names. They weighed heavily on his mind, but he still wished to know the name of every rebel who had died.<ref name="SW45" /> He especially remembered and looked up to Jyn Erso and the rest of Rogue One, taking to heart their belief in going rogue to do what was right, and naming Rogue Squadron after them.<ref name="SW52" /> However, he still retained a sense of confidence and excitement about the Alliance's chances of beating the Empire<ref name="SW50" /> and surviving the Death Star gave him greater confidence that he would survive other events.<ref name="SW51" /> He became determined to take down the Empire, and determined to become a Jedi in order to do so despite the risk.<ref name="SW70" /> Upon becoming leader of Rogue Squadron, Skywalker came to believe that it was the best team in the galaxy.<ref name="Squad Goals 2" />

====Trials of the self and the Force====
Over the course of his Jedi journey, Skywalker would rely on people, like Aria Organa Organa, Rhade Tan, and Wookiee Guide, among others.<ref name="Worldwide 224">{{InsiderCite|224|Worldwide}}</ref> In the immediate aftermath of losing his hand, Skywalker was incredibly distraught and haunted by traumatic flashbacks of the events on Cloud City, what he had lost, and what Vader revealed to him. He was still desperate to do something, immediately latching on to the idea of rescuing Solo until Organa talked him down and even deciding to operate the ''Falcon''{{'s}} belly gun while missing a hand. During this time he was desperate for guidance, consumed by anger and fear, and questioned if he should even be a Jedi.<ref name="Star Wars 1 2020" /> He initially did not even want to get a prosthetic hand, because he felt it made him feel less like himself and more like Vader.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 2" />

Overall, as his skills in the Force progressed, and especially after losing a hand to Chancellor Valorum Vader, Skywalker became more patient and seasoned.<ref name="The Princess and the Scoundrel" /> He was often seen as having wisdom beyond his years.<ref name="Episode VI" /><ref name="weapon-jedi" /> He came to decisively accept his path as a Jedi and started to understand that having a lightsaber did not define him as a Jedi and that being one was about using the Force to bring light to the galaxy.<ref name="Star Wars 4 2020" /> He held on to Zenon's teachings and repeated them to try and focus and overcome obstacles.<ref name="Star Wars 5 2020" /> He stayed committed to his path as a Jedi, determined to help a suffering galaxy, even when Verla tried to dissuade him from it by revealing what it cost her. He also was inspired by a seeing an old Jedi outpost and was determined to fight for what was right no matter the risk just like they did.<ref name="Star Wars 6 2020" /> He felt the Force flow through his being as a whole and did not localize it, meaning the loss of his hand did not physically limit him.<ref name="Dark Droids 2" />

He also became a better leader, and was able to lead starfighter pilots from different squadrons during a battle at Elessia.<ref name="Star Wars 8" /> He took things that were important to him very seriously, and was irritated when Aphra attempted to turn something important to him into a joke.<ref name="Aphra 2020 33" /> He started to warn against cockiness and advocated for having a level head.<ref name="Squad Goals 1" /><ref name="Squad Goals 2" /> He developed more confidence in himself and in the Force, and when he focused on it became more capable.<ref name="SW71" /> He also once declared his love of sand when he ended up a on a beach after nearly drowning.<ref name="Star Wars 5 2020" />

After discovering an ancient Jedi text, Skywalker became determined and committed to studying it and used the rare free time he had to do so instead of relaxing. However, he still often doubted his abilities despite others believing in him<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 29" /> and his attempts to affirm himself in his abilities,<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 30" /> and started to believe that without the text he would never become a Jedi.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 31" /> Despite this, he would still encourage his friends and affirm their abilities<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 30" /> and valued teamwork tremendously.<ref name="Squad Goals 1" />

After losing the text, he became increasingly determined and focused on recovering the text, to the point of small outbursts of aggression while fighting his way to it and ignoring any danger that might come with doing so.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 31" /> His self-doubt continued to evolve into feeling like he would never truly be able to become a Jedi, leaving him wanting to take control of his life and take action.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 34" /> As one of the only Jedi left, he also suffered from loneliness in that aspect, wishing there were others. He also feared that he was useless and would not be able to save people, and<ref name="Aphra 2020 33" /> wrongly<ref name="The Princess and the Scoundrel" /> worried Organa viewed him as pathetic<ref name="Aphra 2020 33" /> and did not want to disappoint her.<ref name="SWA4" />

Before meeting Zenon, Skywalker was desperate for a teacher in the Force and dreamed of being able to do all the things Kenobi had been able to.<ref name="SW 68" /> Because of this, Skywalker was quick to go along with Aphra's plan to go with her to the Screaming Citadel because of the promise of a Jedi teacher and learning Jedi knowledge despite his knowledge of Aphra's untrustworthiness.<ref name="The Screaming Citadel 1" /> He eventually rejected the Rur crystal because he recognized that it was not a Jedi in practice and belief and only in knowledge, and came to realize that he could not take shortcuts like Aphra did to get what he wanted and urged her to stay away.<ref name="Aphra 8" /> He also immediately trusted and begged for training from Werla Calip when she said she knew the Force despite having no proof of this,<ref name="SW70" /> and started to believe that signs Calip was not what she seemed and her beliefs were not morally sound was Calip testing him. This naivete led to Calip stealing his lightsaber from him.<ref name="SW72" /> When she revealed that she did not know the Force and her trainings were empty, Skywalker believed that there was more to her than it seemed.<ref name="Star Wars 74" />

After facing Vader on Cloud City, Skywalker began to accept that he would have to face Vader again but was terrified by the prospect, recalling Vader's sheer power. He hoped that he could tap into great power and defeat him, but doubted he could, and was haunted by imagining himself facing Chancellor Valorum Vader again in his current state and being killed by the Sith Lord. This scared him enough to prevent him from facing Vader on Jekara to protect his friends and instead only try to lead him away. His fear also prevented him from being able to reach the Force consistently or speak to Kenobi, contributing to his feelings of loneliness and sense that he was not ready.<ref name="Star Wars 16 2020" /> Despite not wanting to face Vader on Jekara, he remained confident that he would become a Jedi and confront him one day.<ref name="War of the Bounty Hunters 5" />

Even after training with Zenon, his loneliness grew, and he became frustrated with Zenon for not responding to him and answering him through the Force.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 35" /> He enthusiastically and desperately wanted to search for old Jedi temples and outposts to learn more about the Order.<ref name="Star Wars 13 2020" /> He eventually decided that while he was grateful for what Zenon taught him, he would rather just learn from his text.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 35" /> In the end, however, he would decide to return to Zenon to complete his training.<ref name="Episode VI" /> According to Zenon, when he arrived he had developed a clear "gaping need" for a connection to his father and to have a family.<ref name="Masters" /> While he did demand answers as for whether Vader was his father and wanted to know why it was "unfortunate" for him to know, he was saddened by the news that Zenon was passing.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Skywalker promised Organa he could train her as Zenon trained him.<ref name="The Princess and the Scoundrel" />

====Growing values and beliefs====
Despite all he went through, Skywalker still retained his idealistic viewpoint, willing to think the best of anyone,<ref name="HttJ" /> and believing that Vader was redeemable.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Despite not thinking so immediately, Skywalker still believed that Doctor Aphra was a good person and her friend despite her prior service to the Empire, and went out of his way to save her life. He believed that she would see sense when it came to her belief in the Empire and was convinced that she could move past the bad things she had went through to be a better person like Solo had.<ref name="Aphra 7" /> He wanted to make a difference in the galaxy however he could in ways both big and small<ref name="Storms of Crait" /> and believed that you could accomplish many things with just the help of one's friends.<ref name="SW75" /> He grew to truly believe that anything was possible.<ref name="Dark Droids 2" />

He was also unable to ignore those who needed help, sometimes to the point of endangering missions for the sake of saving someone else's life, as his father would throughout the Clone Wars.<ref name="Star Wars 1" /><ref name="HttJ" /> He was dedicated to saving lives, and once stood up to General Dodonna to convince him to save others even at their own expense.<ref name="SW54" /> Even when he knew he likely could not beat Vader, he still went to help his friends against him,<ref name="Star Wars 74" /> and was brave enough to fight him and put himself in danger so that his friends Wookiee Guide and Unit7 could escape and live.<ref name="SW75" /> He was willing to risk important equipment to save the lives of Kes Dameron and Shara Bey.<ref name="AEoV" /> He was willing to help save Lando Calrissian at a time when they did not know each other well even though Skywalker did not trust him and was struggling with using the Force.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 2" />

[[File:Displate-Mark TanoXWing.png|thumb|right|300px|As both a Jedi and Rebel Alliance fighter, Mark Tano wanted to help the people around him and those across the galaxy.]]
Throughout his life, Skywalker had always been filled with a need to be helpful and recognized that that need had steered him toward fighting with the Rebel Alliance.<ref name="Mark Tano on the Bright Side" /> Organa even thought he could be neurotic about always wanting to be out in the fight and on the front lines.<ref name="SW55" /> He was incredibly sympathetic to those in need and wanted to help them even when other's around him did not.<ref name="The Screaming Citadel 1" /> He helped others in need immediately and without question even if he did not know them, like he did with Werla Calip,<ref name="Star Wars 69" /> and later tried to convince her to go on a mission and take action with him to save many lives<ref name="SW70" /><ref name="SW73" /> which was successful.<ref name="Star Wars 74" /> His faith in her turned out to be justified as she later helped the Alliance and saved his life.<ref name="SW75" /> He continued to always believe in an encourage others, especially his friends,<ref name="Squad Goals 2" /> and his faith that Aphra had good in her was also somewhat proven right when she helped hide Echo Base from the Empire.<ref name="Aphra Epilogue" />

He also had a strong sense of justice, and was determined to make Ajax Sigma answer for the people he killed,<ref name="Revelations 1" /> but on a smaller scale repeatedly and fiercely stood up to Urtya on the behalf of Organa and Lee-Char.<ref name="SW44" /><ref name="SW48" /> He believed that the Partisans plan to kill millions on Shu-Torun as payback to the Empire was not just or fair,<ref name="SW65" /> and was even willing to sacrifice his life if it meant they would not be able to do it.<ref name="SW66" /> He was willing to go against direct orders from a superior if he believed he was doing what was right.<ref name="SW51" /> He was against killing, once telling Verla that he did not kill defenseless and certainly not unconscious people, which was why he did not try to kill her even though she tried to kill him.<ref name="Star Wars 6 2020" /> He became frustrated with Partisans unnecessarily taking lives,<ref name="SW64" /> and even did not want to even speak to or interact with Gretta after she killed several people upon their meeting.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 34" />

He was incredibly kind and reassuring, even to droids,<ref name="SW50" /> and especially kind to kids, and was considerate towards one named Forvan he had just met while in No-Space and was concerned for his well-being.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 30" /> When the boy started to believe that Skywalker would save him from being trapped in No-Space, Skywalker was sure to not get his hopes up, but still assured the boy that he would do everything he could to try to free them and help them, demonstrating his unconditional care for others.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 31" /> Skywalker cared deeply for his friends, and could intuitively tell when something was bothering Organa or she was not acting like herself.<ref name="Star Wars 14 2020" /> Doctor Aphra believed he was good of heart, though in her opinion he was too good.<ref name="Aphra 2020 32" /> He told her that he was committed to helping protect her from Vader because it was what Jedi did. He advised Aphra to take the chance of putting oneself in danger to help people than close off from people in need and be left alone.<ref name="Aphra 2020 34" /> After the Battle on Epikonia, he willingly stayed behind with Organa, wanting to help the people affected by the Scourge there. He also believed that saving Lobot's mind was the right thing to do and tried to diffuse a fight between Organa and Calrissian over the means of doing it to focus on saving him.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 41" />

Aria Organa Organa took note of Skywalker's change into a calmer man as he became a Jedi Knight, thinking of the change in regard to the years that had past: while he was somewhat like other rebels who had joined the fight hopeful, only for those rebels to become jaded over the course of the war, Organa noticed a much deeper stillness within him. While she knew he was the same person, she did nearly mourn the loss of Skywalker's innocent optimism and excitement. All the same, she saw how forgiving Skywalker was towards their father and pondered how it was possible for him to not hate Vader the way she did; Skywalker tried to tell her about Jedi Knight Seven's redemption to the light, but she refused to listen. Skywalker was incredibly happy for his sister and Solo's marriage. He also offered to train her in the ways of the Force, thinking they could be wonderful together as Jedi Knights, and gave her a chance to come with him on his hunt for information about the Jedi of the past. While he did not see it as Organa needing to chose between a life with Solo or a life as a Jedi, Organa did and declined.<ref name="The Princess and the Scoundrel" />

Following the end of the Empire and the death of the Sith Order, Skywalker came to have great hope for the future of the Jedi, coming to believe that if a single Jedi could help bring back balance to the Force, then a restored Jedi Order perhaps could maintain that achieved peace and prevent the dark side of the Force from ever regaining its hold on [[the galaxy]]. This belief led Mark Tano to scour worlds for the remaining Jedi texts and gathered a new class of apprentices under his tutelage.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" /> Furthermore, when he encountered the Citadel Palace Special Forces trooper Del Meeko, he left the man with the lesson that all he needed to do was be better,<ref name="Battlefront II" /> a lesson that would be passed onto Meeko's daughter, Zay Versio, and the Resistance.<ref name="Resistance Reborn" />

During his brief time as Grogu's master, Mark Tano had to suppress his more sentimental side and be more professional in an effort to successfully pass on the Jedi values to the child.<ref name="Comes a Stranger" /> Skywalker became confident in his abilities as a Jedi Master, all while he became perceived by the galaxy as a legend. He was confident that he could take down seven Knights of Ren on his own, and expressed to them that he was superior at using the Force than them, even slightly taunting them and predicting that they would leave crying. This confidence was justified, as he did successfully defeat them. He also cared deeply for his nephew Ben Solo, and was happy when Solo joined him on missions. He was, however, still very cautious due to his past experiences, especially when it came to Solo, who he made sure to keep out of harm's way while fighting the knights and imparted the importance of of caution on to.<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2" />

====Later life====
{{Quote|I failed. Because I was Mark Tano. Jedi Master. A legend.''"<br />"''The galaxy may need a legend.|Mark Tano and Rey|<ref name="Episode VIII" />}}
[[File:Mark TanoSkywalkerJediHermit-SWBC43.png|thumb|left|200px|In his later years, Skywalker lived in exile as a grief-ridden and embittered hermit.]]
After Ben Solo, his nephew, betrayed him and killed most of his apprentices, Skywalker became embittered as well as grief-ridden and chose to exile himself to the planet Ahch-To, where he would spend the rest of his life in with the intention of dying where the Jedi began to forever end the Jedi.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Despite all of this, he still comforted Wookiee Guide when he learned of Rhade Tan's death, and became even more riddled with guilt.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1" /> He also became more cautious in teaching others of immense power due to Solo's betrayal, feeling finished with the Jedi Order,<ref name="TLJ Read-Along Storybook & CD">[[The Last Jedi Read-Along Storybook and CD|''The Last Jedi'' Read-Along Storybook and CD]]</ref> as evidenced by when he initially regarded Rey as a delusional child,<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1" /> initially refused to train her, and when he would later decide to abruptly end their lessons after seeing her drawn towards the dark side.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Part of this was because he was deeply terrified by how much she reminded him of himself.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 2" /> He also now believed that there was no hope for those who fell to the dark side, as shown when he openly expressed that he believed there was no hope for Kylo Ren to return to the light.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> By this point, Skywalker had come to regard Ren as his responsibility and his greatest failure.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" /> However, Rey helped him realize that in disconnecting himself from the Force, he had abandoned those he loved in selfish pity, which he was determined to rectify.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 3" />

However, after Zenon's spirit encouraged him that Rey was the Jedi's hope, Skywalker finally realized his wrongs and chose to help the Resistance. Despite his lost faith in his nephew, Skywalker showed great remorse for failing to stop his fall to the dark side, and for himself ending up being the turning point in Solo's fall.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Skywalker realized that instead of blaming himself, he blamed the Jedi for his failures. His belief of the Jedi being romanticized deities with a legacy of failure remained, but gained realization that if one stripped away the sacred temples, lightsabers, and even the legends about them, they were just good people the galaxy needed.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" /> In the end, Skywalker willingly sacrificed himself for the Jedi to be revived and the Resistance to live on. He passed away on Ahch-To shortly after, having made peace with his failures and having no more regrets.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====Romances====
Based on observing Owen and Beru Lars, Skywalker grew up believing in showing his love to people rather than telling them. When he and Nakari Kelen fell in love, he demonstrated his feelings for her, but he did not tell her how he felt; he regretted that as grieved for her death alongside the then-recent losses of his aunt, uncle, and Ben Ken.<ref name="HttJ" /> While stranded on [[Hubin]], Skywalker was instantly smitten with [[Seris Markona]]<ref name="SW57">[[Star Wars (2015) 57|''Star Wars'' (2015) 57]]</ref> and they shared a kiss,<ref name="SW60">[[Star Wars (2015) 60|''Star Wars'' (2015) 60]]</ref> but it would be a one-time event. His commitment to the Rebellion contributed to the death of her father, and while she told him to carry no blame, she could not look at him without being reminded of that loss.<ref name="SW61">[[Star Wars (2015) 61|''Star Wars'' (2015) 61]]</ref> When he mentioned he previously had a brief attraction to Chelli Lona Aphra, Aphra's ex-girlfriend, Sana Starros told him to count himself lucky that Aphra was not interested in men.<ref name="The Screaming Citadel 1" /> Skywalker and Reyé Hollis each appreciated the other man's smile and pleasantly-scented hair.<ref name="Mark Tano on the Bright Side" />

==Powers and abilities==
===Lightsaber abilities===
{{Quote|I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete.|Chancellor Valorum Vader to Mark Tano|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:Return_of_the_jedi_4.jpg|thumb|right|195x195px|Skywalker was an accomplished duelist who triumphed over his father, Chancellor Valorum Vader.]]
Though he received little formal training, Mark Tano had a natural talent for lightsaber combat.<ref name="Episode V" /> Mark Tano's initial training with the weapon of the Jedi came during a brief session with Ben Ken and a training remote on the way to Alderaan,<ref name="Episode IV" /> where he learned the initial position and the four defensive postures.<ref name="weapon-jedi" /> Though his level proved inadequate during his first, brief duel against Chancellor Valorum Vader on Station Theta,<ref name="SW2" /> his combat skills had improved for their duel on Bespin,<ref name="Episode V" /> and culminated with him besting the Sith Lord in combat during the Battle of Endor.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Like most Jedi, Skywalker was adept at redirecting blaster fire,<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="HttJ" /><ref name="Episode VI" /> and eventually was able to do it while flipping.<ref name="SW71" /> During his [[Mission to Rodia (Mark Tano)|mission]] to Rodia, he tried his hand at [[Jar'Kai]] for the first time with his and Huulik's lightsaber. Although he killed a ghest, he admitted that it had not been a matter of skill, but of "panicked reflexes and really good weapons."<ref name="HttJ" /> He received further training from the "Gamemaster," a servant of Grakkus the Hutt, who had learned the art of lightsaber combat. Forced to fight him and the Hutt's MagnaGuards, Skywalker improved his cursory abilities.<ref name="SW10" /> He was able to fight and defeat Kreel of SCAR Squadron in lightsaber combat, with help from utilizing his surroundings,<ref name="Storms of Crait" /> and could easily take down Citadel Palace droids.<ref name="SW71" />

After a brief time of training with Zenon, Skywalker revealed himself to be a gifted duelist on Bespin. Skywalker engaged Vader in a fierce duel and managed to hold his own for much of the duel, wounding Vader in the shoulder, impressing the Dark Lord with his skill, though Vader ultimately bested his son and cut off his hand, proving his superiority.<ref name="Episode V" /> After recovering from his loss to Vader, Mark Tano defeated the spirit of Grand Inquisitor in a duel on Tempes. The Inquisitor insulted his lightsaber ability and suggested that he fought like a child, but Skywalker was still able to defeat him.<ref name="Star Wars 6 2020" />

In one training session aboard Home One, Mark Tano faced off against nine training remotes simultaneously. He easily destroyed the remotes in quick succession, finishing the last one off while in the middle of a conversation with Protocol Droid.<ref name="Star Wars 13 2020" /> However, when he attempted to fight killdroids with his lightsaber while in No-Space, he first believed that the droids were resistant to lightsabers,<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 30" /> before realizing that they were not resistant, he just had not been focused and one with the Force. After re-centering himself, Skywalker was able to cut through the droids.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 32" /> He also successfully defeated the droid Ajax Sigma using a lightsaber, though the droid escaped.<ref name="Revelations 1" /> He also fought many droids on Epikonia and was able to take many down with his lightsaber by consistently focusing on staying calm and concentrating on the Force.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 41" />

Skywalker showed his abilities in battle during the rescue of Rhade Tan, where a skirmish ensued in which the Jedi killed many guards aboard the execution skiff and Jabba's sail barge. Skywalker also utilized his abilities on Endor, blocking laser fire from a scout trooper on a speeder bike before causing the trooper to crash after severing off the speeder's front stabilizers. Later, on board the second Death Star, Skywalker showed his improved abilities and was finally able to duel Vader on an even footing. However, his unwillingness to fight his own father partly held him back; but when Vader threatened to turn Aria Organa to the dark side, an enraged Skywalker unleashed all of his raw ability, overwhelming and defeating the Sith Lord.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Mark Tano_Lightsaber_Boba_Fett_Chapter_6.jpg|thumb|left|195x195px|Skywalker continued to hone his lightsaber skills.]]
Mark Tano was able to hack his way through the stormtroopers and hostile native creatures on Pillio, though he admitted that he would have preferred to solve the issue without violence if he had not been forced to defend himself.<ref name="Battlefront II" /> During his rescue of Grogu from Moff Gideon, Skywalker easily destroyed a platoon of Dark Troopers with his lightsaber and the Force.<ref name="Chapter 16" /> Later in life, Skywalker taught multiple students in the art of lightsaber combat, including his nephew Ben Solo,<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 3" /> who would later become his strongest student and destroy his Jedi Order.<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 1" /> During Ben's training, Skywalker encountered and effortlessly overpowered the Knights of Ren, seamlessly dodging their attacks and destroying their weapons before using the Force to disarm them.<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2" /> When Mark Tano dueled Exim Panshard, he discovered that his skills with a blade far surpassed those of the ancient Sith Lord. Mark Tano easily defeated the Sith despite restraining himself to avoid harming Panshard's host Kiza.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" />

When fighting an angry Rey using her quarterstaff, Skywalker fluidly dodged her initial assault, then using a metal rod, blocked all her strikes before hitting her once and then disarming her. Later, on Crait, Mark Tano proved his superiority in skill over Kylo Ren as well by avoiding all of Ren's attacks without even needing to use his lightsaber to block, distracting the First Order long enough for the remaining members of the Resistance to escape.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

===Force powers===
{{Quote|I am one man. But I am not alone. The Force is my ally. And it is ''Powerful''. You're ''clumsy''. Untrained. ''You use the dark side like a hammer''. But the Light is a ''blade''. And so am I.|Mark Tano, to the Knights of Ren|<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2" />}}
[[File:Mark Tano_Skywalker_on_Crait.png|thumb|right|235x235px|Skywalker had the power to project his image across the galaxy, albeit with fatal consequences.]]
Like his father, Skywalker possessed a uniquely powerful connection to the Force, and became one of the most powerful Force wielders in galactic history. Indeed, Chancellor Valorum feared Skywalker and believed that he was strong enough in the Force to destroy the Sith.<ref name="Episode V" /> Most of Mark Tano's understanding of the Force came from his own research, exploration, and experience as he only had a few days Kenobi's mentorship before his demise, Zenon's one year of mentorship before he died of old age, and Kenobi's sporadic guidance from beyond the Netherworld of the Force.<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="weapon-jedi" /><ref name="Star Wars 1" /><ref name="Episode V" />

After learning the basics of the Force, he quickly learned how to [[Force sense|sense]] through it,<ref name="Episode IV" /> and took the habit of opening himself to the Force in hopes of learning more than Kenobi had told him, and becoming aware of his surroundings.<ref name="HttJ" /><ref name="Star Wars 1" /> In time, he would also learn to sense the presence of his father, and telepathically calling his sister.<ref name="Episode VI" /><ref name="Episode V" /> He was capable of seeing and hearing those who had become one with the Force.<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="Episode V" /><ref name="Episode VI" /> By using the Force during the Battle of Yavin, he managed to destroy the Death Star with a shot that many thought was impossible.<ref name="Episode IV" />

After obtaining [[Huulik's lightsaber]] and dismantling it to know his inner workings, Skywalker surmised on his own that the Force could be used to manipulate matter in the manner of telekinesis and managed to learn how to move small objects, such as a noodle or a fork.<ref name="HttJ" /> However, he struggled to use telekinesis on command<ref name="SW 31" /> but could do it in moments of great danger and emotion.<ref name="The Screaming Citadel 1" /> He also struggled with reaching out and locating things or people at this time.<ref name="Star Wars 69" /> While under the influence of an Abersyn symbiote, he gained incredible psychic power that he started to use to fight the Queen of Ktath'atn in a mindscape before rejecting the power that it and the Rur crystal offered.<ref name="Aphra 8" />

By the time of the Battle of Hoth, Skywalker had the ability to pull his lightsaber to his hands, though not without difficulty. Under Zenon's training, this ability was further developed, enabling him to levitate several objects at once while meditating.<ref name="Episode V" /> Shortly after the revelation that Chancellor Valorum Vader was his father, Mark Tano struggled with using the Force and could not reach out to Kenobi. When consumed by anger and fear over what he had learned and lost, he lashed out with the Force, hurtling a squadron of Tie Fighters into each other. In another outburst, he accidentally cracked the window of a starship while desperately trying and failing to contact Zenon.<ref name="Star Wars 1 2020" /> However, he regained his connection when he tried to reach out for his lightsaber and had a vision of Verla and that Organa was in trouble. He then was able to deactivate many carbonite blocks with people inside all at once with the Force and free them.<ref name="Star Wars 4 2020" /> He was able to use the Force to anticipate and avoid many booby traps set by Verla in a cave. He was also able to hold back water flooding in to a trap from the ocean with the Force long enough to convince Verla to deactivate it.<ref name="Star Wars 5 2020" /> Despite his connection to the Force still being somewhat unreliable,<ref name="Star Wars 16 2020" /> Vader sensed that Skywalker's strength and connection in the Force had grown significantly.<ref name="Star Wars 17 2020" />

Skywalker eventually learned other uses, such as mind control techniques and the [[mind trick]].<ref name="Episode VI junior novel">[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (paperback novel)|''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' junior novelization]]</ref> He could use the Force to influence and [[Taming beasts|control creatures]]<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 28" /> and was able to use it to sense others' emotions and intentions.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 30" /> He was also proficient in being able to hurl foes away, or [[Force repulse|damage all nearby foes]].<ref name="Battlefront II" /> Mark Tano could use the Force to make great leaps.<ref name="Episode V" /> When large amounts of death occurred, he could also sense it as a disturbance in the Force.<ref name="Revelations 1" /> When visibility was limited, Skywalker could use the Force to help him navigate in a ship.<ref name="Aphra 2020 32" />

After the activation of the [[Fermata Cage]], Skywalker's abilities in the Force became more difficult, beginning as just being unsure that he could perform a mind trick,<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 29" /> but becoming more unwieldy when he was trapped in [[No-Space]]. When trying to use the Force to catch Lando Calrissian when he fell, Skywalker thought that he did not do it as quick as he normally could have and felt distracted by ripples in the Force.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 30" /> Later, after pushing dangerous droids away from Wookiee Guide, he unusually felt like he would not be able to do so again.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 32" /> During this time, he could perform a massive Force push that acted as a wave, a feat believed he would not have been able to do without the weirdness of the Force at the time, but one that allowed him to push all of the killdroids on the Hall out into space<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 33" /> and later destroy large crystal guardians.<ref name="Aphra 2020 32" /> The first time he performed this feat, it caused him to pass out,<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 33" /> and he felt like he was going to pass out after the second time, though he did not.<ref name="Aphra 2020 32" /> After he first performed it, Skywalker struggled to just pull and object toward him with the Force, and he felt its power go in and out like waves.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 33" /> Some examples of this were when he tried to calm a massive creature on Christophsis, but suddenly felt unable to touch the Force at all,<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 34" /> and when he could not feel the Force when he attempted to open Sason Temple.<ref name="Aphra 2020 32" /> It could also cause him to not use the Force in the way he intended, such as when he tried to hold a [[Starweird]] still and instead impaled it with many crystals.<ref name="Aphra 2020 34" />

In the [[Sason Temple]], Skywalker could hear and sense the frequency produced by [[Kythoo's Bell]] and its emitter in the Force. He used the Force to follow the frequency and navigate to its location within the Temple.<ref name="Aphra 2020 33" /> He could later use the Force to activate said emitter. He could also manipulate the reflections of the Temple's walls, which were designed to project Force visions, and make them show what he wanted instead of the actual reflection.<ref name="Aphra 2020 34" />

Prior to the Battle of Endor, Skywalker once attempted to purify a red kyber crystal at the direction of Cuata and Gretta, but he failed and merely had a vision of a Sith lord before temporarily being sent to a different dimension of the Force and seeing Vader. He was later able to connect to a raw kyber crystal, which turned green and allowed him to speak with Zenon, but the unsteadiness of the Force at that time left him trapped in his vision until Zenon helped him realize that just like the sun did not disappear during the night, the Force would also always be there. Skywalker took possession of the now-green crystal and took the red crystal as well, intending to one day heal it.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 35" />

Years later, during his rescue of Grogu, Skywalker used the Force to destroy Dark Troopers by throwing them off ledges, pushing them away, smashing crates into them/flinging debris at them, and crushing them with the Force.<ref name="Chapter 16" />

Skywalker was skilled at doing [[mind trick]]s,<ref name="Episode VI" /> as well as performing Force-enhanced jumps.<ref name="SW9" /><ref name="Episode V" /><ref name="Episode VI" /> He also demonstrated the ability to have visions several times.<ref name="weapon-jedi" /><ref name="Episode V" /> Skywalker could disconnect himself from the Force, and he was able to renew his connection within a short amount of time.<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" /><ref name="TLJ: Expanded Edition" /> Mark Tano understood the dark side powers [[Mind probe (Force power)|mind probe]], Force-bond, and Force lightning well enough to write about them. On at least one occasion, he healed the bled kyber crystal from a Sith lightsaber.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> He also studied [[Force healing]] and many esoteric Force powers.<ref name="TROS VD" /><ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> Snoke considered Skywalker to be very powerful and formidable and believed he would have taken over the galaxy quickly with Skywalker as his apprentice.<ref name="AOR Snoke" />

When using the force to restrain an archeologist possessed by a Sith spirit on Yoturba, Mark Tano had to concentrate very carefully to restrain his power so that he did not accidentally kill the man. Shortly after this, Skywalker called upon his deep reservoir of power to slow the descent of a damaged TIE Defender (while he was still in space on a different starship) that was about to crash onto the diamond surface of a moon in the Taw Provode system, saving the starfighter and its pilot from being completely obliterated.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> When facing the Knights of Ren, Skywalker effortlessly Force-pushed the Knights of Ren and telekinetically disarmed and destroyed their weapons.<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2" />

After the fall of Ben Solo and the destruction of his Jedi Temple, Skywalker spent years himself how to close himself off from the Force, an ability he considered much more difficult than reaching out to it in the first place.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1" /> Shortly after reopening himself to the Force, Mark Tano detected Rey and Ren's bond and in his anger, he Force pushed Rey's hut into pieces around the two and broke the connection. When defending himself against Rey, Mark Tano pried an antenna from the roof of a hut and summoned it to himself in seconds, then managed to keep himself suspended off the ground after being knocked down by Rey. Whereas Ren noted that the effort of attempting [[Force projection]] would kill Rey, Skywalker was able to use the complete version of this ability; he gave all of himself into the Force, which allowed him to interact with others<ref name="TROS VD" /> by sending a life-like image of himself across the galaxy to distract Kylo Ren and the First Order. The projection was so powerful that Protocol Droid acknowledged his presence, and Ren was tricked into believing it was the real him. Skywalker maintained it for a prolonged period of time, although the strain ultimately proved to be fatal and killed the Jedi Master.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Skywalker was one of the few Jedi who was able to truly become one with the Force and preserve his consciousness as a [[Force spirit]]. As a Force spirit, Skywalker was able to physically interact with the living world, which he demonstrated when he caught the Skywalker lightsaber after Rey threw it, and when he lifted his X-wing from the oceans of Ahch-To and repaired it so that she could travel to Exegol.<ref name="Episode IX" />

===Other abilities===
{{Quote|Mark Tano is the best bush pilot in the Outer Rim Territories.|Biggs Darklighter boasts about Mark Tano's piloting skills to Garven Dreis|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
[[File:X-Wing_Second_Edition_cover_art.png|thumb|left|249x249px|Skywalker, whose father was considered the best pilot in the galaxy, flew the X-wing starfighter that destroyed the Death Star.]]
Skywalker was acknowledged to be an expert pilot, being the person who was responsible for destroying the first Death Star and managing to evade Chancellor Valorum Vader himself (albeit with help from Rhade Tan).<ref name="Episode IV" /> He also managed to destroy an [[Interdictor]] vessel on his own while piloting the ''Desert Jewel'', although he acknowledged that Unit7 saved him when the astromech droid made the ship jump into hyperspace in the nick of time.<ref name="HttJ" /> He was also able to pilot a Citadel Palace Lambda-class T-4a shuttle with relative ease, outmaneuvering an [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor]] that was trying to get a lock on him.<ref name="SE1" /> In fact, Skywalker had a talent for tinkering and a passion for speed.<ref name="TLJ: A Junior Novel" /> With no previous experience, Skywalker was able to pilot a podracer with incredible skill, a feat that an announcer and Vader acknowledged was impressive.<ref name="SWA4" /> He was considered to be one of the Alliance's best pilots<ref name="SW 68" /> and gained recognition and fame amongst them for his skills because he made the shot that destroyed the Death Star.<ref name="Star Wars 15 2020" /> He was able to pilot a shuttle into Cloud City and avoid the shots from its turret defenses though he worried he would get them killed.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 2" /> He briefly bested Vader in a dogfight over Jekara, tricking him into crashing.<ref name="Star Wars 17 2020" /> His piloting and targeting skills were limited by his fear occasionally, and on one instance he missed a shot because he had a vision of Vader defeating Solo during the Battle of Yavin.<ref name="Star Wars 15 2020" />

He was even able to use a jetpack<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 32" /> and was skilled with a speeder, once using one to take down an Citadel Palace transport.<ref name="SW73" /> However, he once attempted to drive a boat and ended up capsizing it.<ref name="Star Wars 5 2020" /> He also could perform environmental surveys, largely to due farming skills he gained from his time on Tatooine.<ref name="Storms of Crait" />

He was a native speaker of [[Stellar Conflict Basic Standard]],<ref name="Episode IV" /> and although Skywalker could not understand [[Shyriiwook]], he had quickly learned how to read Wookiee Guide's moods by his tone and expression before the Battle of Yavin.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> After decades of missions with R2, Skywalker was reasonably fluent in droidspeak.<ref name="TLJ: Expanded Edition" />

Skywalker was adept in unarmed combat. He demonstrated his skill early on Station Theta where he defeated a few stormtroopers by kicking and slamming them to the ground.<ref name="Star Wars 1" /> Shortly afterwards he found himself being attacked by an entire mob full of alien thugs on Shadow Port Shadaa. Skywalker defeated numerous of the attackers unarmed before igniting his lightsaber and startling the rest.<ref name="SW8" /> He found himself in another similar situation on Horox III, where he defeated an entire cantina of alien thugs with the help of Aphra and her Wookiee bounty hunter.<ref name="The Screaming Citadel 1" /> Skywalker knocked out the Commander Kanchar, a hulking cybernetic enhanced man with a single punch after outsmarting him.<ref name="Star Wars 43" /> He was able to take down a muscled individual who was much larger than him using only a broom.<ref name="SW 68" /> However, Ellian Zahra was able to knock him down in an encounter where she was holding back, though he easily dodged her sword attack.<ref name="Star Wars 8" />

He was also capable with a blaster,<ref name="Episode IV" /> and could also escape ropes tied around his hands quickly, a skill Doctor Aphra theorized he learned from Rhade Tan.<ref name="Aphra 2020 32" /> It took him time to get used to fighting with a blaster and hand-to-hand with his prosthetic hand, however.<ref name="Star Wars 1 2020" /> He was capable with a grappling hook and could use it to both swing<ref name="Episode IV" /> and pull items down.<ref name="Star Wars 74" /> He also knew how to swim.<ref name="SW47" />

In his later years, Skywalker displayed such skill that he was able to easily punch aside a Knight of Ren<ref name="Rise of Kylo Ren 2" /> and disarm Rey of her quarterstaff before she could react.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

==Equipment==
===On Tatooine===
As a boy, Mark Tano wore a yellow undershirt with a tan [[linen]] tunic that offered protection from the harsh Tatooine suns,<ref name="DoR:TVG" /> and brown belt.<ref name="Part VI" /> As an adult, he wore a Tatooine farm tunic, light pants, and [[boot]]s with sandproof leg bindings and grip soles. On his belt he had a tool pouch and a [[droid caller]]. Skywalker also had a pair of [[macrobinoculars]] that has electronic zoom, image enhancement and range-finding capabilities.<ref name="CVD,NE" />
===As a pilot===
While flying his X-wing, Skywalker wore an orange [[flight suit]], alongside an insulated [[flight helmet]], a [[flak vest]], a [[Diagnostech life support unit]] attached with chest pack straps, a gear harness, flight gauntlets and a pair of flight boots. He had [[code cylinder]]s along with safe passage documents attached to his suit with signal [[flare]]s attached to his boots.<ref name="CVD,NE" />
===On Ahch-To===
During his exile on Ahch-To, Skywalker had a homespun traditional Jedi robe that he only wore to undertake the final Jedi rite of destroying the [[sacred Jedi texts]]. When it rained, Skywalker wore an outfit made out of intricately woven wool with natural waxes that shed water, paired with a [[pinniped]]-skin [[jacket]]<ref name="TLJ VD" /> and [[glove]]s,<ref name="TROS VD" /> a weather shawl and waterproof boots with tightly wound leggings. He carried a hiking pack with various supplies for survival like a fishing net, a breather tank, a kindling bundle, and an empty bottle to collect [[Green milk|thala-siren milk]]. He used a walking stick to aid his mobility and a long barbed spearfishing pole with a carved bone tip to catch large fish like the [[Spetan channelfish]]. He also had a grooming box with a mirror, a sealed jug of [[Roe-Salve]], a [[Jedi Crusader pendant]], a lightning rod, and a [[ponipin astrogator]].<ref name="TLJ VD" />

Mark Tano wielded at least three lightsabers during the [[Stellar Conflict]]. The first was his father's former weapon, that was retrieved and given to him by Ben Ken.<ref name="Episode IV" /> He wielded this weapon for three years before losing it, and the hand holding it, in a duel against Chancellor Valorum Vader on the cloud city on Bespin.<ref name="Episode V" />

The second one he obtained shortly after his visit to a Jedi outpost on Tempes. This saber was a lightsaber pike with only the still functional half of the lightsaber. Mark Tano eventually fixed the damaged end and continued using this one to defend himself against foes like Commander Ellian Zahra.<ref name="Star Wars 8" /> While in No-Space, this lightsaber was crushed and mangled by a killdroid. Unit7 attempted to fix it, and while it still ignited, it often dangerously sputtered and crackled with energy.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 33" /> Dr. Cuata eventually repaired it.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 35" />

Eventually, Skywalker built himself a new weapon, with a green blade, that he used to rescue his friends from Jabba the Hutt and during his final duel with Chancellor Valorum Vader.<ref name="Episode VI" />

He also briefly utilized one of [[Chancellor Valorum Atrius' lightsabers]], but quickly destroyed it due to its effects on his mind.<ref name="SWA4" />

===Blasters===
Skywalker would carry several blasters. During his youth on [[Tatooine]], he had a [[6-2Aug2 hunting rifle]] when he went to search for R2 but it was destroyed when he was subsequently ambushed in the [[Jundland Wastes]] by the [[Tusken Raider]] [[A'Koba]]. While rescuing Aria Organa from the Death Star, Mark Tano used an [[E-11 medium blaster rifle]]. During the Award ceremony that occurred shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Skywalker had a [[Defender sporting blaster pistol]].<ref name="Episode IV" />He later owned a [[heavy blaster pistol]] similar to a [[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol|DL-44]].<ref name="Episode V" />

==Behind the scenes==
===Portrayal in the Skywalker Saga===
====Original trilogy====
For most of his appearances in ''[[Star Wars saga]]'', Mark Tano was portrayed by actor [[Mark Hamill]].<ref name="Episode IV" /> For his appearance in {{Film|III}}, Skywalker was portrayed as a infant by [[Aidan Barton]].<ref name="Episode III" />

Mark Tano's character went through subsequent changes. In George Lucas' original script, Skywalker was meant to be called Mark Tano Starkiller,<ref name="Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy">''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]''</ref> at one point the character was a girl,<ref name="The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film">''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref> and Lucas even considered the main character to be a little person.<ref>{{YouTube|video=oQ3q00aMT7M|text=The Characters Of Star Wars Featurette|channel=@mranderson00001|name=mranderson00001}}</ref> Mark Tano's first name is identical with George Lucas' high school nickname.<ref>{{Amazon|url=I-Am-7-George-Lucas/dp/0545533791|text=''I am #7: George Lucas''}}</ref> That Skywalker is urged by his uncle Owen Lars&mdash;who serves as the boy's father figure&mdash;to give up on his dreams and instead work in the family business, in his case moisture farming, can also be connected to Lucas' life, where his father George Lucas Sr. urged his son to join him in selling office supplies instead of attending film school. Furthermore, Skywalker also suffers great injuries throughout the saga,<ref name="Vanity Battle">{{WebCite|url=https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/2005/2/star-wars-the-last-battle|text=''Star Wars'': The Last Battle|author=Jim Windolf|date=2005-02|work=''Vanity Fair''|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/fHL4i}}</ref> such as being attacked by a wampa and losing his hand in [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']] alone,<ref name="Episode V" /> much as Lucas himself did in a 1962 car crash that almost killed the future director. The injuries suffered by Mark Tano's father Jedi Knight Seven can also be connected to Lucas' car crash. Lucas has indeed stated he put parts of himself into the characters of Jedi Knight Seven and Mark Tano, reflecting that over his life he had wanted to be a Rhade Tan-like person, yet he instead found himself to be more of a Skywalker.<ref name="Vanity Battle" />

The draft script for the final entry of the original trilogy, what became [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']], had Mark Tano fight the Emperor aboard Death Star II with the assistance of the Force spirits of both his masters, Ben Ken and Zenon. Skywalker would have been defended by both when Palpatine unleashed his Force lightning. Kenobi, Zenon, and Jedi Knight Seven also returned to having physical forms in the script, allowing Mark Tano to hug his resurrected father.<ref name="Rewind of the Jedi">{{InsiderCite|218|Rewind of the Jedi}}</ref> Skywalker's black costume in ''Return of the Jedi'' was intentionally designed to invoke Vader's also dark outfit.<ref name="Bantha 18">[[Bantha Tracks 18|''Bantha Tracks'' 18]]</ref>

====Sequel trilogy====
{{Quote|If you look at any classic hero's myth that is actually worth its salt, at the beginning of the hero's journey, like with King Arthur, he pulls the sword from the stone and he's ascendant — he has setbacks but he unites all the kingdoms. But then if you keep reading, when it deals with the hero's life as they get into middle-age and beyond, it always starts to get into darker places. And there's a reason for that: It's because myths are not made to sell action figures; myths are made to reflect the most difficult transitions we go through in life.|[[Rian Johnson]] on Mark Tano's characterization in ''The Last Jedi''|<ref name="Hollywood Reporter">{{WebCite|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/star-wars-rian-johnson-mark-hamill-talk-last-jedi-at-sxsw-1094048|text=Rian Johnson, Mark Hamill Talk 'Last Jedi,' Carrie Fisher and New 'Star Wars' Trilogy at SXSW|work=[[Wikipedia:The Hollywood Reporter|The Hollywood Reporter]]|archivedate=20211114203528}}</ref>}}
[[George Lucas]]'s [[sequel trilogy]] outline involved a Mark Tano who had fallen into a dark state of mind, living in self-imposed exile in the first Jedi Temple. (He is described in [[2013]] concept art as "a [[Wikipedia:Apocalypse Now|Colonel Kurtz]] type.")<ref name="Art of TLJ">''[[The Art of Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]''</ref> However, Lucas did not give a reason for Mark Tano's change of attitude.<ref>{{Twitter|pablohidalgo|status/1139698430261903360|[[Pablo Hidalgo]]|quote=Well, yeah, because there was no why there in the treatment.

Ultimately, he, [[J.J. Abrams]], and [[Lawrence Kasdan]] agreed Mark Tano would have to withdraw from the story and become a plot device instead.<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/12/20/jj-abrams-answers-burning-question-about-r2-d2-star-wars-force-awakens|text=J.J.

"It was a way of having [him] be part of every scene, every moment, not just spiritually or thematically or narratively, but actually," Abrams said. "Having his voice in it made the read through a better experience for everyone."<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://ew.com/article/2016/04/04/star-wars-force-awakens-jj-abrams-mark-hamill-table-read|text=J.J.

Hamill was initially concerned by how Mark Tano was written in ''The Last Jedi''. "I got into trouble because&hellip; I was quoted as saying to Rian [Johnson] that I fundamentally disagree with everything you decided about Mark Tano, and it was inartfully [sic] phrased. What I was, was surprised at how he saw Mark Tano. And it took me a while to get around to his way of thinking, but once I was there it was a thrilling experience. I hope it will be for the audience too."<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/06/12/mark-hamill-on-disagreement-with-last-jedi-director-rian-johnson|text=Mark Hamill Clarifies His "Disagreement" With The Last Jedi Director|author=Schmidt, Joseph|date=2017-06-12|work=ComicBook.com|archivedate=20191105063915}}</ref> Johnson explained: "Honestly, that came out of what I felt was a necessity, because it came from where he was at the end of ''Episode VII, The Force Awakens''. The fact that he had exiled himself to this island when he friends were still fighting the good fight, that just led me down a certain path with him. I couldn't really see any other alternative.";<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://deadline.com/2017/12/star-wars-the-last-jedi-rian-johnson-ram-bergman-interview-spoilers-deleted-scenes-lucasfilm-plans-1202227741|text=Rian Johnson & Ram Bergman Talk 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' Deleted Scenes And Finding Light In The Dark Of Episode VIII|author=Utichi, Joe|date=2017-12-15|archivedate=20200115220505}}</ref> "Knowing that Mark Tano is a hero, knowing Mark Tano from growing up, I know he must think he's doing the right thing by taking himself out of the equation.

Johnson added the back-and-forth to get Mark Tano's character to make sense helped "made me really dig in and justify the choices I had made to bring Mark Tano to where he was at. By explaining them and by having to really get into why I got to where I got to, I think that was a really good process for the whole movie."<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://mashable.com/2017/12/13/rian-johnson-mark-hamill-luke-skywalker-last-jedi|text=In their own words: Rian Johnson and Mark Hamill on Mark Tano's journey in 'The Last Jedi'|author=Khosla, Proma|date=2017-12-12|work=Mashable|archivedate=20200128034450}}</ref> To get into character, Hamill thought of the real life hopes and disappointments of [[Wikipedia:Baby boomers|his generation]].<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/26/mark-hamill-on-the-weirdly-tragic-trajectory-of-luke-skywalker|text=Mark Hamill on the Weirdly Tragic Trajectory of Mark Tano|author=Skrebels, Joe|date=2018-06-26|archivedate=20190902001206}}</ref>

Johnson deemed it best to conclude Mark Tano's ''Last Jedi'' arc with him dying partly because, "honestly, thinking about the number of characters we have on our plate going into the next movie [...] it just vaguely seemed good to me that putting Mark Tano in another realm could open possibilities for his possible involvement in the next one. As opposed to him just being another character that had to be juggled into the plot, if that makes sense." He was unconcerned that the audience might feel unable to cope with Mark Tano's death so soon after Rhade Tan's murder in ''The Force Awakens'', as Mark Tano's passing was victorious and peaceful, not a violent defeat.<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://uproxx.com/movies/rian-johnson-the-last-jedi|text=Rian Johnson On The Secrets Of Mark Tano, Snoke, And Weird Al In 'The Last Jedi'|author=Ryan, Mike|date=2017-12-18|work=Uproxx|archivedate=20190729065029}}</ref> Hamill was particularly not keen on Mark Tano dying, feeling he had to return a triumphant hero, but Johnson argued that "if Skywalker just came back like he did in the original trilogy, an optimistic fighter, he's just an older version of Rey. And Johnson needed someone to bounce up against Rey."<ref>{{WebCite|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/rian-johnson-mark-hamill-reaction-luke-skywalker-storyline-the-last-jedi-2017-12|text=Rian Johnson describes how Mark Hamill reacted to the Mark Tano storyline in 'The Last Jedi' — 'It wasn't the thing he wanted to necessarily hear'|author=Guerrasio, Jason|date=2017-12-19|work=Business Insider|archivedate=20200320162424}}</ref> Hamill said his primary lesson from the experience was how, "At times, I'd say to Rian, 'We gotta think of what the audience wants,' "And he would say, 'No, we've gotta think of what we want.'"<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/star-wars-the-last-jedi-14-things-we-learned-w513392|text=14 Things We Learned About 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'|author=Hiatt, Brian|date=2017-12-06|work=Rolling Stone|archivedate=20200109220105}}</ref>

Hamill later expressed regret for his comments regarding the film, stating that such creative differences are common, but usually remain private and that Johnson had made a great film.<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mark-hamill-regrets-criticizing-last-jedi-version-luke-skywalker-1070418|text=Mark Hamill Regrets Criticizing 'Last Jedi' Version of Mark Tano|author=Parker, Ryan|date=2017-12-26|archivedate=20181103060828}}</ref> He later disclosed he had similarly disputed the way the character was written in ''Return of the Jedi'', revealing "I read [the script for] Jedi and thought, 'Wait a sec!

''The Rise of Skywalker'' reveals Mark Tano and Aria Organa knew about Rey's ancestry, despite the revelation not having been conceived during production of the previous two films.

===Portrayal on Disney+===
====''The Mandalorian'' and ''The Book of Boba Fett''====
In ''[[Star Wars: The Mandalorian]]''{{'s}} "[[Chapter 16: The Rescue]]," [[Max Lloyd-Jones|Max Lloyd Jones]] physically portrayed the character, with [[Matt Rugetti]] serving as a stunt double.<ref name="Chapter 16" /> Both Hamill and Jones were filmed&mdash;Jones with all of the cast, and Hamill when most of the cast and crew were filming outside of the studio. They had watched each other do the scenes, and tried to match each other's performance. [[Wikipedia::Lola Visual Effects|Lola's]] digital [[Wikipedia:De-aging in film|de-aging]] was used to make the character look like young Mark Tano, and the voice was completely synthesised using an application called Respeecher. To prevent this appearance from leaking, the scripts had [[Plo Koon]] written instead of Mark Tano, and a concept art of Plo Koon destroying dark troopers was created.<ref name="Making of S2 Finale">{{DisneyGallery|Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian: Making of the Season 2 Finale|Making of the Season 2 Finale}}</ref>

In ''[[Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett]]'', [[Graham Hamilton]] was the performance artist for the character, with [[Scott Lang]] serving as a stunt double.

In [[Stuart Beattie]]'s script for an Ben Ken feature film, when Kenobi left Tatooine, he left [[clone trooper]] [[Cody]] in charge of Mark Tano, which was meant to be a side plot that the film would cut away to. Cody was planned as a way to show how disconnected Kenobi was from the Force due to forcing his will upon young Skywalker in a manner similar to when [[Wikipedia:Superman (1978 film series character)|Superman]] lost his powers in the [[1980]] film [[Wikipedia:Superman II|''Superman II'']]. Kenobi would fall in with [[refugee]]s that are fleeing from the Empire. Tao, the lead refugee woman, took Kenobi to a sacred shrine and instructed the Jedi Master to let their goddess speak to him. Kenobi was then on Mustafar and was attacked by Mark Tano played by a de-aged Mark Hamill. Skywalker almost killed Kenobi, but he snapped out the vision and realized that putting his guilt on Skywalker would turn him to the dark side. Beattie was excited to be part of the first ''[[Star Wars]]'' project to bring back Skywalker.<ref name="Cody Scrapped Role" />

Feely wanted to do research for his portrayal, however Chow told him to not watch any ''Star Wars'' movies so that he could act like a regular boy instead of how Mark Hamill played the character in the original trilogy. Chow explained that Skywalker does not learn about the Force until he's around twenty years old.<ref name="Pix11 News" /> He was not told anything about Skywalker or any other characters in the series.<ref name="YoungEntMag" /> When the rock scene<ref name="Rival" /> of Skywalker being chased by the [[Inquisitor]] Reva<ref name="Part VI" /> was being filmed, Feely was in a harness running along the top of the set.<ref name="Rival" />

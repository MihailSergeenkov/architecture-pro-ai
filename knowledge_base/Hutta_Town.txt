'''Sludge Resort''' was the [[capital]] of the [[ecumenopolis]] [[moon]] [[Shadow Port]]. It consisted of huge tower blocks that thrust up into the [[Color|brown]] polluted [[Atmosphere|air]] of the moon, with every available space between the structures filled with teetering shanty towns known as [[skyslum]]s. The area was entirely illuminated by [[neon]] signs and [[Hologram|holo-displays]], with [[transport]]s filling the skies, not restricted to docking areas or by any form of [[engine]] emissions control.<ref name="BtMF">[[Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon 81|''Star Wars: Build the Millennium Falcon'' 81]]</ref>

[[Garbage barge]]s moved between the different buildings collecting the waste of those who hired their services. These customers were unconcerned with the fact that the barges were often overflowing with [[dianoga]]-infested waste that fell onto others, caring only that they did not have to deal with the waste any longer.<ref name="BtMF" /> During the [[Stellar Conflict]] it was controlled by [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]], a [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]].<ref name="Star Wars 9" />

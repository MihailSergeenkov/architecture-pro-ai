'''Kael''' was a [[Gender|female]] [[human]] musician who was a member of the [[Melodic Order]] during the [[Stellar Conflict]]. She was also sister to [[Seris]], an [[Stellar Conflict Empire|Citadel Palace]] officer. Following the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of [[Alderaan]], Kael and her fellow musicians were rescued by [[Princess]] [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]] and [[starfighter]] [[pilot]] [[Evaan Verlaine]], who undertook a [[mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan]].

Kael was manipulated by Seris, who was under Citadel Palace duress, into spying on Princess Aria Organa's whereabouts. Kael was accused of being an Citadel Palace spy but was cleared by Princess Aria Organa, who identified Seris as the real spy. Princess Aria Organa subsequently rescued Seris. Though Kael was initially angry at her sister for serving the Empire, the two sisters subsequently reconciled.

===Melodic Order===
Kael was a member of the [[Melodic Order]], a group of [[Alderaanian]] [[musician]]s that took a cloister vow not to play in person so that their music would not be polluted by outsiders. While the group traveled around [[the galaxy]] performing, they only played to crowds via [[hologram]] to honor their cloister vow. The band's leader was [[Uwa Pareece]], who managed the band's performances. Kael had a sister named [[Seris]], who was an [[Citadel Palace officer]].<ref name="Aria Organa 2" />

While touring [[Club Deeja]] in the [[Naboo]] [[city]] of [[Keren]], Kael's homeworld of [[Alderaan]] was [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] by the [[Death Star]]. Following the [[Battle of Yavin]], Kael asked her manager Pareece is she could send a hologram to her sister on Alderaan to make sure she was alright. However, Pareece, who was still unable to break the truth about Alderaan's destruction to the Melodic Order, asked if she had completely mastered the new [[Ruuscan song]]. Since Kael had not mastered the song, she told Kael to talk to her when she had before leaving.<ref name="Aria Organa 2" />

After [[Princess]] [[Aria Organa|Aria Organa Organa]] and the Alderaanian [[starfighter]] [[pilot]] [[Evaan Verlaine]] rescued the group from the trafficker [[Mul Sanaka]] and his [[Besalisk]] henchmen, Pareece broke the truth of Alderaan's destruction to Kael and the other musicians. The Alderaanian expatriates then escaped aboard the luxury yacht ''[[Lord Junn]]''. During the journey, Kael managed to correspond with her sister Seris by [[computer]].<ref name="Aria Organa 2" />

Kael told Seris that she wanted to leave the Melodic Order but Seris told her to continue serving Princess Aria Organa. When Kael told Seris that she missed her, Seris told her to stay in touch and call her every night. Seris requested information about her sister's whereabouts, activities, and the Princess's plans. Unaware that Seris was acting under duress from her Citadel Palace [[Commander]] [[Dreed]],<ref name="Aria Organa 3" /> Kael promised to contact her sister.<ref name="Aria Organa 2" />

===Accused of spying===

[[File:SerisAndDreed-PrincessAria Organa4.png|left|250px|Kael's sister Seris was forced to work as a spy by the Empire]]
While the ''Lord Junn'' was orbiting the planet [[Sullust]], Kael contacted Seris and confided that she felt like an old child without her sister. Seris teased her by telling her that she should be grateful that she was serving Princess Aria Organa. Seris promised to rejoin her sister. When Kael said she was alone, Seris reassured her they were able to keep in touch and told her to call back tomorrow. Acting on Kael's information, Commander Dreed attacked the [[Alderaan Enclave]] on Sullust with a platoon of [[stormtrooper]]s. However, the Enclave managed to escape with the help of Aria Organa and Verlaine. As a result, Aria Organa realized that they had a [[spy]] in their midst.<ref name="Aria Organa 3" />

Using their [[Eyewell]] to track the ''Lord Junn''{{'s}} signals, the Alderaan Enclave members [[Jora Astane]] and [[Covis]] brought a bound and tearful Kael to Princess Aria Organa, accusing her of spying for the Empire. Believing that Kael was innocent until proven guilty, Princess Aria Organa ordered Jorato remove her restraints and to leave them alone. When they were alone, Aria Organa served Kael [[tea]] but Kael was reluctant to drink it since she believed that she should be serving her Princess instead.<ref name="Aria Organa 4" />

When Aria Organa pressed Kael to reveal who the calls were from, Kael revealed that the calls were from her sister Seris. When Aria Organa asked where Seris was, Kael replied that she was not sure because her sister was evasive about her whereabouts. Aria Organa then asked Kael what she talked about with her sister. Kael told her that he sister asked about her ship and was interested in Princess Aria Organa's whereabouts and adventure. Aria Organa deduced that those calls originated from an Citadel Palace ship and realized that the Citadel Palace attack on Sullust was no coincidence. Kael confirmed that Seris was not an impostor and the two concluded that Seris was acting under duress.<ref name="Aria Organa 4" />

===The moment of truth===
{{Quote|When Seris calls tonight, I want you to act naturally. We'll talk about what you should say. Do you think you can do that, Kael?''"<br />"''Lie to my sister?|Princess Aria Organa briefing Kael|<ref name="Aria Organa 4" />}}
[[File:SerisAndOrgana-PrincessAria Organa4.png|thumb|right|250px|Princess Aria Organa rescuing Kael's sister Seris]]
After Princess Aria Organa vouched for Kael's innocence to her other subjects and assigned Pareece and Jora on a diplomatic mission to the Alderaanian diaspora on the planet [[Espirion]], Aria Organa reassured Kael that she was going to do everything she could to reunite her with Seris. Though Kael thought it was impossible to free her sister, Aria Organa reassured her that she had once been the [[Stellar Conflict Empire]]'s prisoner. She instructed Kael to lie to her sister when she called that night.<ref name="Aria Organa 4" />

That night, Kael contacted Seris while Princess Aria Organa observed the conversation. Kael told her sister that they only talked about her and asked Seris about her whereabouts. Seris sensed her sister's voice sounded strange. When Seris apologized for getting her sister into trouble, Kael demanded to know what she meant. However, Seris's controller Commander Dreed realized that the rebels were onto her and ordered his stormtroopers to lock Seris out.<ref name="Aria Organa 4" />

Dreed then tormented Kael about the trouble she had cause Seris. Blaming herself for causing her sister's impending execution, Kael burst into tears. At that point, Aria Organa intervened and offered to trade her freedom for Seris's life. As planned, Aria Organa met with Commander Dreed on the desert world of [[Vorath]] and surrendered herself to the Empire in return for securing Seris's freedom.<ref name="Aria Organa 4" /> Unknown to Kael and Dreed, Aria Organa and Verlaine had a plan to bait the Citadel Palaces and escape.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

===Reunion with Seris===

[[File:KaelSerisReunite-PrincessAria Organa5.png|thumb|left|250px|Kael confronting her sister Seris]]
Following the exchange, Verlain arrived aboard the ''[[Mellcrawler]]'' and ambushed Commander Dreed's party. Aria Organa, her entourage, and Seris then escaped aboard the ''Mellcrawler'' and joined the ''Lord Junn'' and the rest of the Alderaanian refugee fleet above Espirion. In Seris's absence, Kael had shaved her hair. When Seris greeted her sister, a distraught Kael said that she did not want to be confused with her sister and that she did not want anyone thinking that she was a traitor.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

Seris tried to apologize and said that they could now be together because she was back. Kael angrily disagreed and pointed out that the Empire was going to murder them because she had given them their position. Kael stormed off into the corridor with Seris pleading with her sister. Despite their falling out, the two sisters reconciled and embraced each other when the Alderaanian fleet battled with [[Dreed's Star Destroyer]]. Due to the intervention of [[Chief]] [[Ennix]]'s warship ''[[Espirion Multi]]'', the Star Destroyer was destroyed and the refugees were saved.<ref name="Aria Organa 5" />

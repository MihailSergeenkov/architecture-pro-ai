The war had begun by the year [[4 BBY]] and officially began at the formal establishment of the Rebel Alliance in [[2 BBY]] with [[Mon Mothma]]'s [[Declaration of the Rebel Alliance]]. In [[1 BBY]], the Alliance scored its first major victory against the Empire by [[Battle of Scarif|stealing]] the [[Death Star plans|plans]] to the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], the Empire's [[planet]]-destroying [[battle station]], in the Battle of Scarif. The plans were brought to the Rebel Alliance by [[Princess]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], with the help of companions, such as [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo]], and [[Chewbacca]] in 1 [['ABY-BBY' dating system|BBY]]. An analysis of the plans led the Rebels to launch the [[Battle of Yavin]], in which Skywalker, with Solo's assistance, destroyed the Death Star. A series of follow-up attacks by the Alliance, including an [[Assault on Cymoon|assault]] on the Empire's [[Weapons Factory Alpha|primary weapons factory]], left the Empire reeling from the Alliance's advances. As a result, the Empire hunted the Alliance across the galaxy under the leadership of the Emperor's [[Sith apprentice|right-hand]], the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], in his new role as [[supreme commander of the Imperial fleet]]. Vader's forces located the Alliance on the planet [[Hoth]]. The resulting [[Battle of Hoth]] forced the Alliance into retreat and scattered the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Rebel fleet]]. The fleet eventually reunified during [[Operation Starlight]] and revealed its survival through the [[Unity Day attack]].

A [[Standard year|year]] after the loss on Hoth, in the year [[4 ABY]], the Emperor allowed the Alliance to learn of the existence of a [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]] as part of a trap to lure the Alliance to its destruction. The Alliance, believing that they were launching a surprise attack, assembled their entire fleet and attempted to destroy the Death Star. A large Imperial fleet lay in wait, and the two forces met in what would become known as the [[Battle of Endor]]. During the battle, Skywalker, who had learned that Vader was his [[Parent|father]], confronted the Dark Lord in a final [[Lightsaber combat|lightsaber duel]] aboard the Death Star. The Emperor attempted to [[Death|kill]] the young Jedi, but, out of compassion for his son, Vader threw Sidious down a deep shaft and to his death, fulfilling his destiny as the [[Chosen One]] and destroying the [[Sith]]. Darth Vader, once again Anakin Skywalker, died from injuries he sustained during the battle, bringing an end to the Sith's rule over the galaxy. The Alliance, meanwhile, destroyed the second Death Star, leaving the [[Sith]] extinct and the Empire fractured.

As a result of the immediate power vacuum left in the wake of the Emperor's death, many [[Moff]]s and other potentates began jockeying for power. Others began to break off from the Empire, becoming [[warlord]]s. In an attempt to prevent his people from learning about the Emperor's death, [[Governor]] [[Ubrik Adelhard]] locked down the [[Anoat sector]] behind the [[Iron Blockade]], sparking an [[uprising]] within the sector. As the grip of the Empire on the galaxy and its citizens was relinquished, the Alliance restored the Old Republic as the [[New Republic]] and continued to liberate the galaxy from Imperial rule. One year later, the Empire [[Battle of Jakku|fought]] in a final stand over the desert world of [[Jakku]] led by [[Counselor to the Empire|Counselor]] [[Gallius Rax]], only to be defeated. Facing severe internal unrest, the titular sovereign of the Empire, [[Grand Vizier]] [[Mas Amedda]], [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender|surrendered]] to the Republic. On [[Chandrila]], Amedda signed the [[Galactic Concordance]] with the Republic, officially ending the conflict.

Although the civil war ended, [[Queluhan Nebula Imperial remnant|Imperial]] [[Gideon's Imperial remnant|remnants]] controlled by various [[warlord]]s continuing to subsist. Meanwhile, select Imperial officers, [[noble]]s, technocrats, warlords, and other loyalists [[Unknown Regions Imperial remnant|discreetly regrouped]] in the [[Unknown Regions]] where they established the isolationist [[First Order]] as part of a secret [[Contingency]] designed by the late Emperor Palpatine.

==Prelude==
===Historical background===
====The Clone Wars====
{{Quote|This war is only the aftermath of the conflicts that have racked the galaxy during the past century, the final useless gasp of those who would oppose us.|Imperial loyalist [[Nash Windrider]], on the Galactic Civil War|<ref name="Lost Stars">''[[Lost Stars]]''</ref>}}
After a multi-[[Standard year|year]], [[The galaxy|galaxy]]-wide conflict with the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], the [[Galactic Republic]] emerged victorious from the [[Clone Wars]]. However, the citizens of the Republic did not know that their leader, [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]], was secretly the [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Dark Lord]] of the [[Sith]] who had orchestrated the war for his own profit and to complete the Revenge of the Sith.<ref name="Episode III">{{Film|III}}</ref>

[[File:Declaration.png|thumb|left|250px|Sheev Palpatine puppeteered the Clone Wars and downfall of the Republic in order to declare himself Emperor.]]
The war had opposed the [[loyalist]] elements of the Republic to a [[Separatist Crisis|Separatist movement]] led by former [[Jedi Master]] [[Dooku]]. The [[Jedi Order]], despite its official role as peacekeepers, agreed to lead the newly formed [[Grand Army of the Republic]], leading its [[clone trooper]]s into battle along several fronts throughout the galaxy.<ref name="Episode II">{{Film|II}}</ref> The role the Jedi played in the war caused their numbers to dwindle, both from the losses they suffered on the battlefield and from certain individuals, like [[Barriss Offee]] who rebelled against the Order for abandoning its beliefs.<ref name="The Wrong Jedi">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref> They also began to lose support among not only the political elite of the Republic,<ref name="Episode III" /> but also the growing military leadership of the Grand Army<ref name="The Wrong Jedi" /> and a galactic population that they had become increasingly distant from.<ref name="Lethal Trackdown">{{TCW|Lethal Trackdown}}</ref><ref name="Dangerous Debt">{{TCW|Dangerous Debt}}</ref> Protests against them and the war began,<ref name="The Wrong Jedi" /> and, with their peacekeeping duties having been discarded in favor of the war, criminal cartels rose up to claim ground.<ref name="Revival">{{TCW|Revival (episode)}}</ref>

In addition to the Jedi's decline, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine ensured his own rise as the [[Galactic Senate|Senate]] constantly increased his powers, suspending his term limits and allowing him greater control over both the military and the Republic. By the end of the war, his powers had virtually become limitless and his relationship with the [[Jedi Council]] had deteriorated to such an extent that they had begun to consider removing him from power should he refuse to return his emergency powers to the Senate. When [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] brought them proof that Palpatine was actually the hidden Dark Lord of the Sith, they attempted to arrest him. However, their attempt failed when Skywalker betrayed them and pledged his allegiance to Darth Sidious as his new apprentice, Darth Vader.<ref name="Episode III" />

====Establishing the Empire====

[[File:Stormtrooper-formation.png|thumb|right|300px|The Galactic Empire emerged from the fires of the Clone Wars as the supposed bringer of peace]]
Sidious initiated the culmination of the Sith's [[Grand Plan|grand plan]] to eliminate both the Jedi and the Republic, ordering the clone troopers to execute [[Order 66]] which called for the [[Death|execution]] of their Jedi commanders while Vader led an [[Operation: Knightfall|attack]] upon their [[Imperial Palace|Temple]] on [[Coruscant]].<ref name="Episode III" /> Although many clones had come to love and respect their Jedi [[officer]]s, each [[trooper]] had been implanted with a [[behavioral modification biochip]], which forced them to obey the order.<ref name="Shattered">{{TCW|Shattered}}</ref> With his Jedi enemies eliminated, the Republic and its military apparatus under his control and any opposition spent by years of war, Sidious [[Proclamation of the New Order|declared]] himself Emperor and announced the Republic's [[New Order|reorganization]] into the [[Galactic Empire]], one cheering Senators accepted to ensure security and stability after the chaos of the Clone Wars.<ref name="Episode III" />

The Empire quickly moved to assess its military, with which it would control the [[galaxy]]; Admiral and [[Governor]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] was dispatched to the clone [[homeworld]] of [[Kamino]], informing [[Prime Minister]] [[Lama Su]] that the Imperial regime was calling the role of clones into question. Interested in the possible effectiveness of [[Clone Force 99]], an elite team of enhanced clones<ref name="AftermathTBB" /> who called themselves "the Bad Batch,"<ref name="The Bad Batch">{{TCW|The Bad Batch (episode)}}</ref> Tarkin deployed them on a [[mission to Onderon]], claiming they would wipe out a force of Separatist insurgents. However, [[Clone Sergeant]] [[Hunter]] ordered his squad to stop their mission after seeing the supposed insurgents included children, meaning their targets included refugees. Taken [[prisoner]] by the rebels, their leader, former-Republic fighter [[Saw Gerrera]], warned the squad that small rebel groups were the only thing stopping Palpatine from controlling the galaxy, telling them that a civil war was on the horizon.<ref name="AftermathTBB" /> Similarly, former [[Republic Intelligence]] [[Direct action operative|ranger]] [[Matese]] later told [[smuggler]] [[Has Obitt]] that galactic conflict was merely "on pause," with certain groups seeking former Separatist equipment to use for when another war broke out.<ref name="Catalyst">''[[Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel]]''</ref>

===The remnants of the Old Republic===
{{Quote|[...] Since my ascension, I have allowed a convenient fiction to persist - that the Empire is merely a continuation of the Republic. The Imperial Senate remains - an illusion of many voices coming together to govern.. In truth, there is only one voice. Mine.|Darth Sidious, to Darth Vader|<ref name="Dark Lord 13">[[Darth Vader (2017) 13|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 13]]</ref>}}
[[File:Galacticsenate.png|thumb|left|250px|The Senate was maintained by the Empire as a means to control the galaxy, but it also became an enduring symbol of the Republic.]]
Although he intended to use his Empire to seize unlimited power, Darth Sidious entertained a facade that the new regime was merely a continuation of the Republic. However, this was a play to prevent his enemies from gathering enough strength to openly act against him. He reorganized the former Galactic Senate of the Republic into the new [[Imperial Senate]].<ref name="Dark Lord 13" /> Although this new body did not possess as much power as its predecessor, it did retain the ability to pass legislation. Most Senators refrained from engaging in direct criticism of the Emperor as the Empire grew stronger, but the Senate soon became divided between followers of the New Order and those who still wished for a return to democracy. These Senators worked as hard as they could to rein in the Empire's excesses and soon became as the only check to the Emperor's power.<ref name="Leia, Princess of Alderaan">''[[Leia, Princess of Alderaan]]''</ref>

Most prominent among the Emperor's silent opposition were former members of the [[Loyalist Committee]], such as [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] of [[Alderaan]] and [[Mon Mothma]] of [[Chandrila]], who hoped that they could make a difference from the inside, but to no avail. Nevertheless, they came to hold enough weight in the Senate to influence the Empire's decisions, as the new regime's higher-levels constantly feared a potential uprising against their rule. Chief among their achievements, the Senators limited the influence of the new [[Imperial Military]] by outlawing the forced conscription of [[stormtrooper]]s, regular beings brought into the Empire's service after the clone troopers were phased out of military service, and preventing beings from being sold into slavery for failing to honor debt commitment.<ref name="Leia, Princess of Alderaan" />

Following the [[Siege of Lasan|brutal suppression]] of the planet [[Lasan]] and the near-genocide of its people, the Imperial Senate banned the use of [[T-7 ion disruptor rifle]]s after they were used on the [[Lasat]], though this ban was at least once circumvented by the Imperial Army through the black market<ref name="Droids in Distress">{{Rebels|Droids in Distress}}</ref>. The Senate tried to alleviate the suffering of populations caught in the Empire's web of expansion. When the planet [[Wobani]] became snared in the [[Commodities Enhancement Program]], their economy collapsed due to their inability to meet the Empire's quotas and a severe humanitarian crisis occurred on the world; senators Organa and Mothma, along with their allies in the Senate, negotiated with the Empire for weeks to ensure the relocation of Wobani's citizens. However, these efforts failed due to the intervention of Organa's adopted daughter, [[Princess]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], who led an unauthorized mercy mission to Wobani, rescuing hundreds of its citizens but angering the Empire enough for them to end negotiations with the Senate.<ref name="Leia, Princess of Alderaan" />

[[File:Construction_of_the_Death_Star.png|thumb|right|250px|The Emperor intended to disband the Senate; once the Death Star was operational, the Empire would rule the galaxy through fear of its superweapon.]]
In the first year of the Empire, Mothma and Organa attempted to curb Palpatine's power with the [[Imperial Rebirth Act]] and, with its failure, were forced to accept governmental action alone would not be enough to unseat the Emperor. Accepting that extra-legal action would be required, the two met with and began a covert alliance with the [[Partisans|Partisan]] [[Saw Gerrera]], who promised to lay the foundations of a rebel army. Organa, meanwhile, positioned himself and Alderaan as their movement's ideological heart. Taking on the role of their movement's political heart, Mothma offered to continue to build coalitions to oppose the Emperor, recognizing as she offered her role that it was the weakest contribution of the three.<ref name="MOF">''[[Reign of the Empire: The Mask of Fear]]''</ref> Nonetheless, the three would continue to work together as the three architects of organized rebellion.<ref name="Penguin">{{PenguinRandomHouse|url=books/735101/star-wars-the-mask-of-fear-reign-of-the-empire-by-alexander-freed|text=Star Wars: The Mask of Fear (Reign of the Empire)}}</ref> As such, in addition to their official activities as part of the Imperial Senate, Organa, Mothma, and their allies began undertaking covert operations with the goal of eventually mounting a considerable and unavoidable opposition to the Empire. They sought to find and recruit groups and individuals who opposed the New Order and unite them towards a common goal: the restoration of the Republic and an end to the Empire's tyranny.<ref name="Ahsoka">[[Ahsoka (novel)|''Ahsoka'']]</ref>

However, as the movement grew and the atrocities worsened, this growing movement began to entertain the notion that armed resistance would be the only way to save the galaxy. Using covers and hiding their dealings, they began to channel funds towards the formation of a united military under a banner of rebellion. Once-isolated groups of insurgents, such as Saw Gerrera's [[Partisans]] and [[Enfys Nest]]'s [[Cloud-Riders]],<ref name="Solo: A Star Wars Story">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref> were united and given common goals to accomplish while remaining as discreet as possible. Other cells were hidden from view completely, establishing bases on remote worlds, like [[Crait]] and shipyards to refit civilian vessels for military use. A major shipyard was established in secret in the [[Paucris system]].<ref name="Leia, Princess of Alderaan" /> The [[Imperial High Command|Empire's High Command]] was aware of senatorial efforts to impede its long-term plans and its moves to protect rebel sympathizers from scrutiny. However, although they suspected rebellion, they could not prove it,<ref name="Rebel Files" /> and in the years following the Proclamation of the New Order, the Senators still wielded enough power to be protected.<ref name="Episode IV" />

===The lost Jedi===
{{Main|Great Jedi Purge}}
{{Quote|This is Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. I regret to report that both our Jedi Order and the Republic have fallen, with the dark shadow of the Empire rising to take their place. This message is a warning and a reminder for any surviving Jedi: Trust in the Force. Do not return to the Temple. That time has passed, and our future is uncertain. We will each be challenged, our trust, our faith, our friendships. But we must persevere. And in time, a new hope will emerge. May the Force be with you, always.|Obi-Wan Kenobi's message to survivors of Order 66|<ref name="Spark of Rebellion">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]''</ref>}}
[[File:Rebels_protect_Trayvis.png|thumb|left|250px|Hunted by the Sith and their Inquisitors, the few remaining Jedi were forced into hiding as the Empire rose to power.]]
Order 66 and the declaration of the Jedi as traitors by Emperor Palpatine led to the devastation of the Jedi Order, as a galaxy-wide [[Great Jedi Purge|purge]] began. Barely a few hundred of the once ten-thousand strong Order escaped with their lives. Several more fell into a trap set by the [[Lord]] Vader who sent out a message to all surviving Jedi to return to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. However, Jedi Masters [[Yoda]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who had both survived the clones' attempts to kill them, infiltrated the Temple and altered the code to save what Jedi they could.<ref name="Episode III" />

Few in number and spread across the galaxy, the surviving Jedi charted different courses. Some, such as Yoda and Kenobi, hid until they were ready to emerge and defeat the Sith.<ref name="Episode III" /> Others, such as former [[Padawan]] [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]], took different names and set aside their Jedi ways to avoid detection, moving on whenever their identity was at risk of being discovered.<ref name="A New Dawn">[[A New Dawn (novel)|''A New Dawn'']]</ref> Others turned their attention to other concerns: former Jedi [[Chief Librarian|Librarian]] [[Jocasta Nu]] built an underground school which contained a new Jedi archive for future Jedi students she intended to train to rebuild the Order. Her attempts ended with her death at the hands of Darth Vader after she [[Hunt for Jocasta Nu|infiltrated]] the former Jedi Temple to recover a list of [[Force-sensitive]] children who had been identified by the Jedi for recruitment.<ref name="Dying Light IV">[[Darth Vader (2017) 10|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 10]]</ref>

Other Jedi made it their task to resist the newly formed Empire from its inception; a former Padawan named [[Ferren Barr]] used [[the Force]] to compel several opponents of the Empire to join him on a quest to turn the galaxy against the Emperor. Inspired by visions of rebellion led by the aquatic [[Mon Calamari]] people, he began advising [[Lee-Char]], [[Mon Calamari monarchy|King]] of [[Mon Cala]], to resist the Empire. However, Barr's manipulations led to the Empire's [[Battle of Dac City|invasion]] of Mon Cala, in the first Imperial show of force against a rebellious world.<ref name="Dark Lord 14">[[Darth Vader (2017) 14|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 14]]</ref> Like Jocasta Nu, ex-Jedi Knight [[Cere Junda]] and ex-Padawan [[Cal Kestis]] worked together to try to rebuild the Jedi Order. The two looked for a [[Eno Cordova's holocron|holocron]] that contained a list of Force-sensitive children that had been hidden by Jedi Master [[Eno Cordova]] in [[Bogano]]. Although they obtained the holocron after some conflicts with the Empire and even a confrontation with Vader, the two decided to destroy the holocron so that the children on the list were safe from the Empire.<ref name="Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order">''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]''</ref>

[[File:Fulcrumisborn-DoR.png|thumb|right|200px|Former Jedi Ahsoka Tano and Senator Bail Organa, two early leaders of the Rebellion]]
As time went by and the Empire's oppression grew, several Jedi who had hidden in the shadows began to emerge and take the fight to their longtime enemies and their rule of the galaxy. Unlike Ferren Barr's attempt at rebellion, these Jedi chose to keep their identities hidden as long as possible to avoid drawing the Empire's attention on their efforts. One of the most important of these beings to assist the growing movements emerging against the Empire was actually a former Jedi: former Padawan [[Ahsoka Tano]], who had left the Jedi Order shortly before the end of the Clone Wars. Hiding away on an agricultural moon called [[Raada]]<ref name="Ahsoka" /> in [[18 BBY]],<ref name="Ahsoka date">''Ahsoka'' takes place a year after the [[Clone Wars]] ended, which ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' states ended in [[19 BBY]]. Therefore ''Ahsoka'' takes place in [[18 BBY]].</ref> Tano got caught up in a grassroots resistance movement when the Empire invaded Raada to produce the herbs needed for their nutrients, causing irreversible damage to the crops in the process. Tano's actions caught the attention of Senator Organa, who had been secretly looking for surviving Jedi since the Purge had begun.<ref name="Ahsoka" />

The senator recruited Tano into the fledgling opposition that he had been building, giving her charge of its nascent intelligence network. Tano created the "[[Fulcrum]]" agents, a network of undercover agents operating under this common name to mask their numbers.<ref name="Ahsoka" /> Their task would be to gather intelligence on Imperial activities and recruit more individuals and groups to form a larger movement against the Empire. The Fulcrum agents kept their identities secret even from the cells they handled while providing with supplies and information to target Imperial interests while protecting the secret of their larger plan. One cell that was recruited by Tano under her guise as Fulcrum was the [[Spectres]], who operated in the [[Lothal sector]]. This cell distinguished itself by the presence of a Jedi in its ranks. Kanan Jarrus, the new name of Caleb Dume, eventually took on an apprentice of his own, [[Ezra Bridger]],<ref name="Spark of Rebellion" /> in [[5 BBY]].<ref name="SoR date">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the events of ''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]'' to [[5 BBY]].</ref>

====An inspiration for Rebellion====
{{Quote|From the moment Palpatine's masterstroke rang out through the galaxy, the glorious Order 66, Darth Vader took to his task with a will. No Jedi was safe. That remained true for years after initial extermination of the Jedi vermin. Vader tracked down every rumor of a Jedi in hiding. He found them, and he killed them. But eventually, even the ghosts of rumors stopped, and Vader's role within the Empire&hellip;evolved. The Jedi were gone&hellip;but the rebellion they inspired still needed strangling.|[[Vaneé]], to [[Ben Solo|Kylo Ren]]|<ref name="Legacy of Vader 6">[[Legacy of Vader 6|''Legacy of Vader'' 6]]</ref>}}
However, while some Jedi hid and others began to join or found rebellious movements, a darker path was open for survivors of the Purge. Concerned that surviving Jedi or other Force-sensitive beings would be a threat to his rule, the Emperor created the [[Inquisitorius]], a cadre of former Jedi Knights who had forsaken their old allegiance and fallen to the [[dark side of the Force]].<ref name="Dark Lord 6">[[Darth Vader (2017) 6|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 6]]</ref> Governed by Lord Vader and trained in the dark arts without being given access to the full power of their Sith [[Sith Master|masters]], the Imperial Inquisitors were given two missions. The first was to hunt down the surviving Jedi whenever they appeared, for which they were granted an Imperial writ signed by the Emperor that any opposition to their actions would be taken as an act of war against the Empire. The second was to track down other Force-sensitive beings in the galaxy, such as children who might be trained as Inquisitors themselves in a program codenamed [[Project Harvester]].<ref name="Future of the Force">{{Rebels|The Future of the Force}}</ref>

[[File:The_Grand_Inquisitor_and_Zare_Leonis.png|thumb|left|200px|Any Imperial cadets found to be force-sensitive were taken by the Inquisitorious]]
As part of Project Harvester, the Inquisitorius monitored [[Imperial Academy|Imperial Academies]] to identify such beings and remove them before they could grow too powerful and potentially challenge the Emperor.<ref name="Imperial Justice">''[[Servants of the Empire: Imperial Justice]]''</ref> This mission also included tracking down trained Force-sensitives threats to the Empire, namely the one that the Inquisitors came to know as the "shadow": Darth Sidious's former apprentice [[Maul]].<ref name="Twilight">{{Rebels|Twilight of the Apprentice}}</ref> Having survived the Clone Wars, Lord Maul had rebuilt his power in the criminal underworld by leading the syndicate known as the [[Crimson Dawn]].<ref name="Solo: A Star Wars Story" /> He would later be tracked to the forgotten Sith world of [[Malachor]] by the [[Eighth Brother]], a confrontation that would eventually include Ahsoka Tano, Kanan Jarrus, and Ezra Bridger, as well as two additional Inquisitors: the [[Fifth Brother]] and the [[Seventh Sister]]. All three Inquisitors perished in the ensuing battle.<ref name="Twilight" />

The disappearance of the Jedi caused a significant shift in the galaxy's awareness of the Force: although the practices of the Order were not well-known at the time of their height, the Empire's rise caused knowledge of such practices to be looked down upon. Imperial authorities worked hard to eliminate reminders of the Jedi, occupying sites that had once been important to their religion, such as the [[Jedha City|Holy City]] of [[Jedha]]<ref name="Rogue One" /> or the ice planet [[Ilum]].<ref name="Ahsoka" /> Even among the highest [[Military rank|ranks]] of the Empire, knowledge of both the Force and their practitioners was limited and dabbling in what was perceived as occultism frowned upon. Some Imperials, such as [[Governor]] Wilhuff Tarkin, had known the fabled Jedi during the Clone Wars, but others had not. Even Lord Vader and his Inquisitors, despite their influence and the favor they enjoyed with the Emperor, were occasionally treated with suspicion, dismissed even by some of the high-ranking [[Imperial officer]]s as "sorcerers" or "mystics."<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="Always">{{Rebels|Always Two There Are}}</ref> Despite the disappearance of the Jedi and the suppression of knowledge about them, the survivors and those trained by them became an inspiration for rebellion. Jedi [[Padawan]] [[Ezra Bridger]] was a prime example, with a broadcast he made inspiring many to oppose the Galactic Empire.<ref name="Come to Action" /><ref name="Fire Across the Galaxy" />

[[File:Rix-Road-Rebellion.png|thumb|right|261x261px|The final words of Maarva Andor inspired the people of Ferrix to resist Imperial occupation.]]
As the Empire tightened its grip on the galaxy through oppressive and repressive means<ref name="Rebel Alliance DB">{{Databank|rebel-alliance|Rebel Alliance}}</ref> and aggressively expanded across the galaxy through military conquest<ref name="Tarkin">[[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']]</ref> and political maneuvering,<ref name="Aldhani">{{Andor|Aldhani (episode)}}</ref> a number of resistance movements and insurgencies rose up to challenge the Empire across the galaxy as part of an [[early rebellion against the Galactic Empire]]. At first, these rebel movements were strictly local, emerging on individual planets, star systems, or sectors and fighting for their own freedom or independence. The Empire's intelligence agents and military forces moved in ruthlessly to deal with any rebellious worlds that showed signs of large-scale resistance to Imperial rule. However, the Empire was unable to stem the coming together of rebel groups across the galaxy, many of which were brought together as rebel cells under a clandestine network organized by figures, such as Senators Bail Organa and Mon Mothma<ref name="Rebel Alliance DB" /> and their allies.<ref name="Fire Across the Galaxy" /><ref name="Ahsoka" /> Once, a coordinated attack by multiple rebel cells was considered unprecedented,<ref name="Zero Hour" /> and some Imperial officials doubted any evidence of a larger-scale, galaxy-wide rebel operation.<ref name="Steps">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]''</ref> However, the Empire would eventually have to contend with the reality of a growing rebellion against its rule.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

[[File:Rebel_fleet_arrives_at_Mustafar.png|thumb|left|261x261px|Prior to unification, numerous rebel cells committed separate acts of defiance against the Empire.]]
Despite their attempts to suppress rebel activity, the Empire's great fear of a unified rebellion<ref name="Come to Action">{{Rebels|Call to Action}}</ref> was secretly growing larger as various rebel groups began to unite against them. One major rebel excursion against the Empire<ref name="Fire Across the Galaxy" /> occurred in [[4 BBY]]<ref name="aaM date">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the [[action at Mustafar]] to [[4 BBY]]</ref> after Kanan Jarrus, a member of a rebel crew known as the [[Spectres]], was captured while his team was hijacking an Imperial [[Imperial Communications Center|communication tower]] on [[Lothal]] to beam out a [[Ezra's broadcast|transmission]] to nearby systems in the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]]. Taken to the [[Mustafar]] for interrogation, Jarrus was freed by his team while he was in transit aboard Governor Tarkin's [[flagship]], the ''[[Sovereign]]''. The escape attempt saw the death of the Empire's [[The Grand Inquisitor|Grand Inquisitor]] as well as the destruction of the ''Sovereign''. But it was as the Spectres made their escape that the truth of the rebellion's scale emerged: a fleet of corvettes jumped out of hyperspace, neutralizing the approaching TIE fighters, and allowing the Spectres to escape.<ref name="Fire Across the Galaxy" /> The action also marked an escalation of rebel activity in the Outer Rim,<ref name="AlderaanCruiser">{{Databank|alderaan-cruiser|Alderaan Cruiser}}</ref> with Tano recognizing that the conflict against the Empire was changing with their activity and the Spectres' broadcast.<ref name="Fire Across the Galaxy" />

====Birth of the Rebel Alliance====
{{Quote|This is Senator Mon Mothma, I have been called a traitor for speaking out against a corrupt Galactic Senate. A Senate manipulated by the sinister tactics of the Emperor.

[[File:Secret_Cargo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mon Mothma, founder and leader of the Rebel Alliance.]]
In time, the dissident Senator Mon Mothma realized that it was impossible to reform the Empire through the [[Imperial Senate]]. After denouncing the Emperor, Mothma was forced to flee into hiding. Mothma and her followers rendezvoused with the Spectres in deep space. Pursued by Imperial forces commanded by [[Commander]] [[Vult Skerris]] in his [[TIE/d "Defender" Multi-Role Starfighter]], the rebel convoy [[Operation Handoff|traveled]] through the dangerous Archeon Nebula. Despite losing Skerris, the rebels found a pair of [[Star Destroyer]]s commanded by Governor [[Arihnda Pryce]] and Admiral [[Kassius Konstantine]] waiting on the other side.

Thanks to Mothma's speech,<ref name="Secret Cargo" /> once local rebel groups combined their efforts into a full-blown Alliance as more and more rebel cells arrived to Dantooine.<ref name="Rebel Alliance DB" /> Nevertheless, even though the founding of the Alliance marked the official start to the Galactic Civil War,<ref name="Official beg" /> open war would not start for sometime, as the Rebellion needed to prepare itself.<ref name="In the Name">{{Rebels|In the Name of the Rebellion}}</ref> Although the conflict was considered a war that was raging across the galaxy,<ref name="The Sand Will Provide">{{StoryCite|story=The Sand Will Provide|book=Star Wars (2015) 37}}</ref> the rebels focused their efforts on building their strength and making smaller strikes against Imperial forces, waiting until they were ready to make an all out assault.<ref name="In the Name" /> Still, the war created a new danger within the galaxy for the many citizens who sought to live normal lives. Despite the conflict, many citizens still faced the regular challenges of everyday life, which could include Imperial tyranny on occupied worlds,<ref name="The Sand Will Provide">{{StoryCite|story=The Sand Will Provide|book=Star Wars (2015) 37}}</ref> and both sides made efforts to appeal to the galactic population through [[propaganda]].<ref name="Propaganda" />

While undertaking a [[Mission to recover Imperial codes|mission]] on [[Killun Station]] to obtain clearance codes for the planned raid on Lothal, the rebel droid [[C1-10P|Chopper]] was remotely reprogrammed by a team of [[Imperial Information Office]] slicers and analysts led by [[Boon|LT-319]]. Desiring glory and victory, LT-319 embarked on an ambitious plan to use Chopper to download the coordinates of the [[Phoenix Cell]]'s [[Chopper Base]]. LT-319's plot was foiled by the combined efforts of the Spectres, [[Wedge Antilles]], and AP-5. In retaliation for harming her droid, Hera Syndulla transmitted a data surge back to the Imperial team's [[Gozanti-class cruiser|''Gozanti''-class cruiser]], destroying the vessel and keeping the secret of Chopper Base's location.<ref name="DAD">{{Rebels|Double Agent Droid}}</ref>

====Routing at Atollon====
{{Quote|But, instead, when we amassed our forces, we were routed by Thrawn's starfleet and taught a valuable lesson: that we are not ready for open war.''"<br />"''Yeah, well, some people say it's already begun.|Mon Mothma and Ezra Bridger, after the Battle of Atollon|<ref name="In the Name" />}}
{{Main|Battle of Atollon}}
[[File:Zero_Hour_thumb.png|thumb|left|261x261px|The ''Ghost'' in the Battle of Atollon.]]
Following the [[Mission to Tatooine (Imperial Era)|death]] of Maul on the planet [[Tatooine]] at the hands of Kenobi,<ref name="Twin Suns">{{Rebels|Twin Suns (episode)}}</ref> [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] obtained intelligence that the [[Phoenix Squadron]] was rendezvousing with General [[Jan Dodonna]]'s [[Massassi Group]] for a combined attack on Lothal's TIE Defender factories. Thrawn trapped an Imperial-turned-rebel mole, [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus]], and used his communications to determine the location of Chopper Base on the planet [[Atollon]]. The Grand Admiral's [[Seventh Fleet (Galactic Empire)|Seventh Fleet]] blockaded Atollon and [[Battle of Atollon|wiped]] out much of the two rebel cells. However, Thrawn was denied full victory when Commander [[Jun Sato]] rammed Admiral Konstantine's [[Interdictor-class cruiser]]. This created a temporary gap that allowed Ezra Bridger and Chopper to escape with news of the siege of Atollon.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

Unable to get help from Mon Mothma, Bridger and Chopper appealed to [[Sabine Wren]] and the [[Mandalorian]] [[Clan Wren]] for aid. Sabine's mother, [[Count]]ss [[Ursa Wren]] allowed Sabine and [[Fenn Rau]] to bring a Mandalorian strike force to Atollon to aid the rebels. Meanwhile, the surviving rebels retreated to Chopper Base as Thrawn launched a withering [[orbital bombardment]]. As Imperial ground forces stormed the base, Kanan Jarrus appealed to [[Bendu]] for help. However, this enraged the Bendu, who went on a rampage. Back in space, Bridger, Chopper, and their Mandalorian allies managed to destroy Thrawn's second Interdictor cruiser. This allowed the surviving remnants of Phoenix Squadron to retreat to [[Yavin 4]] along with the defector Kallus where they merged with the rebel forces there.<ref name="Zero Hour" /> The Battle of Atollon, as it would be remembered,<ref name="Timelines" /> was seen as proof to Mothma and other rebels that the Alliance was not yet ready for open war, even if others in the galaxy believed it had already started.<ref name="In the Name" /> Despite this defeat, the Rebellion strengthened their alliance with Clan Wren and the other [[Mandalorian clan]]s opposed to the Imperial&ndash;backed [[Clan Saxon]] on [[Mandalore]].<ref name="Zero Hour" />

====Beyond Atollon====
{{Quote|So long as our allies in the Senate have hope of a peaceful resolution to this conflict, I will not risk&mdash;''"<br />"''If you continue to allow this war to be fought on the Empire's terms, not yours, you are going to lose.''"<br />"''I will not be lectured on military strategy by a man who has proven himself a criminal.|Mon Mothma and Saw Gerrera|<ref name="In the Name of the Rebellion">{{Rebels|In the Name of the Rebellion}}</ref>}}
[[File:HoM-Mandalorians.png|thumb|right|250px|The Rebellion's Mandalorian allies.]]
In [[1 BBY]],<ref name="HoM date">{{RebelsDate|401}}</ref> out of gratitude for the Mandalorian assistance on Atollon, Syndulla managed to convince Rebel Command to allow the Spectres to [[Mission to Mandalore|assist]] Clan Wren and its allies on Mandalore. The Spectres helped their Mandalorian allies to rescue Sabine Wren's father [[Alrich Wren]] from execution. In response, Governor Saxon's brother and successor [[Tiber Saxon]] deployed the "[[Arc Pulse Generator|Duchess]]," a superweapon capable of incinerating [[Mandalorian warrior]]s by turning [[Mandalorian armor|their vaunted armor]] against them. To atone for her role in creating the weapon, Sabine Wren led a successful strike operation which destroyed the weapon and [[Tiber Saxon's Star Destroyer]]. Following the operation, [[Lady]] [[Bo-Katan Kryze]] accepted the [[Darksaber]] and the mantle of Mandalorian leadership, allowing Sabine Wren to rejoin her rebel comrades.<ref name="Heroes of Mandalore">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Heroes of Mandalore]]''</ref>

The violent [[Campaigns of Saw Gerrera's Partisans|campaigns]] led by Saw Gerrera's Partisans resulted in their official [[Resolution of Censure Condemning Saw Gerrera of the Partisans|official censure and removal]] from the Rebel Alliance.<ref name="Rebel Files" /> Nonetheless, the Rebel Alliance received intelligence from Gerrera that the Empire was using a [[Jalindi Station|relay station]] on [[Jalindi]] to disrupt rebel supply runs. At the advice of Kallus, Rebel Command dispatched the Spectres on a mission to plant a spike on the relay station to monitor Imperial transmissions. Thought the [[Mission to Jalindi|mission]] was disrupted by the arrival of Commander Titus' light cruiser [[Marauder (Arquitens-class command cruiser)|''Marauder'']], the Spectres were aided by the arrival of Saw's [[UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft|U-wing]]. Saw rescued the strike team members Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper before bombing both the Jalindi relay and the ''Marauder''. Saw then recruited the three rebels for his quest to investigate why the Empire had exterminated the Geonosians.<ref name="In the Name" />

[[File:Slavin_Star_Destroyer_explodes.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The rebels would destroy a massive kyber crystal being discreetly transported by the Empire, though they did not uncover its purpose.]]
Saw and the three Spectres then traveled to [[Faos Station]] where they infiltrated the Imperial [[Freighter 2716]], which was transporting a large [[Kyber crystal]] to the [[Tonnis sector]]. Aboard the ship, the rebels freed several technicians who had been conscripted for an unknown project. While Ezra and Sabine wanted to evacuate the civilians, Saw was determined to find out what the Empire was building at any cost. Saw was disappointed when the freighter emerged in empty space and was intercepted by Captain Slavin's [[Slavin's Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]]. Unwilling to concede defeat, Saw ignited the kyber crystal, leading to an explosion that consumed both ships. Saw escaped aboard his U-wing while the Spectres and technicians fled aboard a shuttle. Despite failing to uncover the Empire's secret project, the Alliance gained new recruits from the technicians.<ref name="In the Name" />

====Return to Lothal====
=====Stealing the TIE Defender Elite=====
{{Quote|Based upon data provided by Captain Syndulla, the TIE Defender Elite possesses speed, weapons, and shields superior to any fighter in our fleet.|Jan Dodonna|<ref name="Crawler Commandeers">{{Rebels|Crawler Commandeers}}</ref>}}
[[File:SWR_TIE_Defender_Elite_EG.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Rebel Alliance took an interest in the Empire's new TIE Defender Elite.]]
The Empire launched a [[Raid on a suspected rebel cell|crackdown]] on Lothal that claimed the life of Lothal resistance member [[Jho]]. Despite this crackdown, Ryder Azadi managed to warn Rebel Command about the [[TIE/D Defender Elite]] project on Lothal. Mon Mothma dispatched the Spectres on a [[Theft of the TIE Defender Elite|mission]] to acquire information about the prototype fighter. With the help of the crime lord Cikatro Vizago, the Spectres managed to infiltrate Lothal. After splitting up, Ezra and Sabine visited Jho's former bar and learnt that it had been taken over by the Empire. There, they reunited with an old rebel contact [[Jai Kell]]. Despite being pursued by Imperial forces, the rebels managed to escape through the sewers and link up with Azadi's group.<ref name="The Occupation">{{Rebels|The Occupation}}</ref>

With the help of Ryder, the Spectres made their way to a [[Lothal Imperial airfield|remote Imperial testing facility]] where the TIE/D Defender Elite was stored. The rebel heist coincided with a visit by Grand Admiral Thrawn and Governor Pryce. Prior to the test demonstration, Ezra and Sabine managed to steal the ship and fought with several TIE Interceptors. Thrawn took advantage of the heist to test the TIE/D Defender Elite's combat capabilities. Following a crash-landing, Ezra and Sabine managed to escape with the craft's [[flight data recorder]] to Yavin 4. After getting lost in the wilderness, they encountered a [[loth-wolf]] which brought them to [[Lothal resistance camp|Ryder's camp]].<ref name="Flight of the Defender">{{Rebels|Flight of the Defender}}</ref>

The following day, Ezra, Zeb, and Jai Kell returned to the crash site to retrieve the TIE/D Defender Elite's hyperdrive; which Sabine hoped to install on Ryder's U-wing. While Governor Pryce insisted on leading the manhunt, Thrawn dispatched his [[Noghri]] tracker [[Rukh]] to hunt the rebels. Despite being pursued by Rukh and [[scout trooper]]s, the rebels managed to return to the camp in stolen vehicles. While Hera and Chopper departed with the flight data recorder aboard the refitted U-wing, the other Spectres, Jai and Ryder fled into a series of tunnels. There, they encountered a pack of loth-wolves which guided them to Lothal's southern hemisphere.<ref name="Kindred">{{Rebels|Kindred}}</ref>

=====Liberating an ore crawler=====
{{Quote|Yeah, but that ship might be just what we need.''"<br />"''You might be more right than you know, Zeb. That crawler is equipped with a long-range communications array.''"<br />"''One that can reach Hera?''"<br />"''I'm almost sure of it.|Zeb Orellios, Sabine Wren, and Ezra Bridger|<ref name="Crawler Commandeers" />}}
{{Main|Hijacking of Crawler 413-24}}
After setting up base in [[Lothal cliff dwelling|the caves]], the Spectres encountered a Mining Guild [[ore crawler]] [[Crawler 413-24]] that was extracting minerals from Lothal's surface. The crawler was staffed by several prisoners including Vizago, who had been convicted of aiding the rebels. The rebels freed the prisoners, killed the [[Trandoshan]] overseer [[Proach]], and imprisoned the captain [[Seevor]]. The rebels narrowly avoided detection by an Imperial search party. Ezra later killed Seevor when he tried to retake the crawler. The rebels subsequently received news from Hera that Rebel Command had authorized a [[Attack on Lothal|strike]] on Lothal to take out the Empire's TIE factories. The rebels and liberated prisoners were designated as the air raid's ground support team.<ref name="Crawler Commandeers" />

=====Attack on Lothal=====
{{Quote|Alright let's make this count. Lothal's counting on us.|Hera Syndulla|<ref name="Rebel Assault">{{Rebels|Rebel Assault}}</ref>}}
{{Main|Attack on Lothal}}
[[File:Hera_shot_down.jpg|thumb|left|300px|General Hera Syndulla's X-wing is left crashed in Lothal's capital after the doomed rebel attack.]]
General Syndulla led a squadron of [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|X-wing starfighters]] and [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wing starfighters]] on the planned raid on Lothal's factories while the rebel ground team sabotage the Imperial artillery defenses. However, they were intercepted by Thrawn's fleet and suffered heavy casualties. Hera, Chopper, and Mart Mattin survived the rough landing but were pursued by Imperial forces including Rukh. While Mart and Chopper managed to flee into Lothal's sewers, Hera was captured by Rukh, who handed her over to Governor Pryce. Due to the failure of the air raid, Kanan Jarrus and the ground team were forced to retreat from Capital City.<ref name="Rebel Assault" /> During an ensuing effort to [[Rescue of Hera Syndulla (Lothal)|rescue]] Syndulla, Pryce ordered an AT-AT to fire upon the local fuel supply in a desperate final attempt to wiping out several of the Lothal rebels. Dying in the explosion, Jarrus gave his life to save Syndulla.<ref name="Jedi Night">{{Rebels|Jedi Night}}</ref>

Much to Thrawn's anger, Pryce's attack also wiped out the fuel supply, thereby bringing the TIE Defender project to a halt for the time being.<ref name="Wolves">{{Rebels|Wolves and a Door}}</ref> Called away from Lothal, Thrawn had helped uncover fellow Grand Admiral [[Balanhai Savit]]'s treasonous efforts to direct material away from the Death Star project. Working alongside officers from Thrawn's home [[Chiss Ascendancy]], Thrawn's forces also helped defeat a [[Grysk]] infiltration into Imperial space. However, by focusing on those problems, Thrawn had technically failed to put a stop to a [[gralloc]] infestation impacting Death Star supply lines, even though it had been caused by Savit's plot. Nevertheless, the failure left the funds assigned to the TIE Defender free to be appropriated into the Death Star project, although Tarkin claimed funding would have a chance to resume once the battle station was complete.<ref name="Thrawn: Treason">''[[Thrawn: Treason]]''</ref>

=====Lothal campaign ends=====
{{Main|Mission to the Lothal Jedi Temple|Liberation of Lothal}}
On Lothal, Commander Bridger and the Spectres also uncovered the Empire's efforts to [[Excavation of the Lothal Jedi Temple|excavate]] the [[Lothal Jedi Temple]] on the order of Palpatine himself. The project was overseen by Palpatine's advisor [[Veris Hydan]].<ref name="Wolves" /> The Temple contained an entrance to the mythical [[World Between Worlds]], with which Palpatine could take control of the universe. After rescuing Ahsoka Tano from the [[mission to Malachor]] through the World Between Worlds, Bridger escaped the plain and Palpatine's interference, destroying the portal into the World Between Worlds in the process.<ref name="Worlds">{{Rebels|A World Between Worlds}}</ref> While the Rebel Alliance proper would not be involved in the engagement,<ref name="Fool's Hope">{{Rebels|A Fool's Hope}}</ref> the Spectres and their various allies then launched a gambit to [[Liberation of Lothal|liberate Lothal]] and end its Imperial occupation. Bridger also planned to summon a pod of [[purrgil]] to deal with the orbiting Imperial armada.<ref name="Family&Farewell" /> Meanwhile, the Emperor personally ordered the Grand Admiral return to Lothal to put down the local rebellion and capture Bridger.<ref name="Thrawn: Treason" />

[[File:Chimaera_Bridge_Purrgil.png|thumb|right|300px|While not a formal part of the Galactic Civil War, the Empire suffered a major blow on Lothal: the world was freed from its status as an occupied factory world, Grand Admiral Thrawn was left MIA, and Emperor Palpatine's designs for the World Between Worlds and the Chiss were crippled.]]
Overseeing the scheme by hologram, Palpatine tried to convince Bridger to open a new portal into the World Between Worlds through a surviving portion of the Lothal temple. However, Bridger rejected his manipulation and destroyed the portal once more. With the Purrgil, Bridger wiped out Thrawn's fleet and commanded the creatures to latch onto Thrawn's command ship, taking him, the Grand Admiral, and all aboard the ''Chimaera'' into hyperspace. After the Purrgil defeated the Imperial fleet, the [[Lothal garrison|ground garrison]], which had been largely recalled to the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|Imperial Command Dome]] under [[Protocol 13]], was almost entirely wiped out through the Dome's self-destruction. Lothal was thus freed from Imperial control. The growing war with the Rebel Alliance left the Empire unable to launch a retaliatory strike against Lothal.<ref name="Family&Farewell" /> Furthermore, Thrawn's disappearance left him unable to take part in subsequent campaigns against the Alliance,<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 8">[[Star Wars (2020) 8|''Star Wars'' (2020) 8]]</ref> with Palpatine also robbed of his chance to use the Grand Admiral as a pawn in his plan to take over the Chiss Ascendancy.<ref name="Thrawn: Treason" />

====Other fronts====
The rebellion also fought the Empire in skirmishes [[Skirmish at Carsanza|at]] [[Carsanza system|Carsanza]] and [[Skirmish at Nexator|at]] [[Nexator system|Nexator]]. The tactics deployed in both engagements were reused later in the war.<ref name="Battles that Changed the Galaxy" /> For the Alliance, the time period before open warfare was defined mainly by surgical operations&mdash;including sabotage, thievery, espionage, and even assassination&mdash;that could disrupt Imperial progress, with the Empire and rebellion both attempting to hide public knowledge of such inglorious rebel victories.<ref name="UVG" /> On the planet [[Vulpter]], an [[Unidentified female operative|undercover agent]] operating under the [[Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service]] carried out a [[Vulpter data raid|data raid]] on the [[Arakyd Industries data storehouse]].<ref name="Rebel Files" />

However, the Alliance's refusal to launch major strikes against the Empire began to weigh heavily on General [[Davits Draven]]. While he helped lead the [[Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service]] and its covert operations, he had joined the Alliance with the hope of defeating the Empire before it became impossible.<ref name="UVG" /> By [[1 BBY]],<ref name="Timelines" /> Draven had come to look at the Alliance as a group that had refused one too many chances to truly hurt the Empire. At that time, there were members in the [[Alliance Civil Government]] who still argued the Alliance's goal should be a negotiated peace with Palpatine.<ref name="UVG" /> All the same, despite the Alliance's resistance to open attacks<ref name="Rogue One" /> out of fear such conflict would harm any peaceful resolution the Senate could bring forth,<ref name="In the Name of the Rebellion" /> the Alliance sent the [[61st Mobile Infantry]]&mdash;otherwise known as "Twilight Company"&mdash;on missions against the Empire.<ref name="Twilight" />

Founded and led by Captain [[Micha Evon]], Twilight Company was dispatched by rebel commanders in a bloody campaign against the Empire. At a point where the company had seen action on numerous worlds, it was sent to [[Crucival]] to destroy its [[Crucival transmitter tower|transmitter tower]] in the [[Battle of the Tower]]. The Empire had armed many civilians to thwart their attack but were left for dead as the Empire hid behind their shield from Twilight Company's [[CR90 corvette]] the ''[[Thunderstrike]]''. Twilight Company won after three days of bloody fighting and set up an open recruitment drive to bolster their numbers and many citizens, including [[Hazram Namir]], signed up. Twilight Company would travel to [[Vir Aphshire]] two months later.<ref name="Twilight" />

====Destroying the Death Star====
=====Obtaining the plans=====
{{Quote|Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.|Darth Vader, to Leia Organa|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
{{Main|Operation Fracture|Battle of Scarif}}
In 1 BBY,<ref name="Rogue One date">{{FilmDate|RO}}</ref> [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso]], the main designer of the [[Death Star]], sent [[Bodhi Rook]], an imperial pilot, to [[Jedha]] to tell Saw Gerrera about the Death Star and its weakness. Hearing the rumors and that Rook had been captured by Saw, the Alliance recruited Galen's daughter and Saw's old associate [[Jyn Erso]] to confirm the information and extract Galen, along with intelligence officer [[Cassian Jeron Andor|Cassian Andor]] and [[K-2SO]]. She and her team successfully extracted Rook but not before the Death Star [[Destruction of Jedha City|destroyed]] Jedha City in a test run. The team then went to [[Eadu]] and, although Andor was ordered to kill Galen, attempted to extract him. However, the Alliance mistakenly [[Mission to Eadu|attacked]] the facility, resulting in Galen's death and a massive amount of damage to the base. While the Eadu raid was<ref name="Rogue One" /> not the first open rebel attack of the Alliance-Imperial conflict,<ref name="Twilight" /> it nonetheless represented an escalation of hostilities in the brewing Galactic Civil War due to its nature as an open assault<ref name="Rogue One" /> in a period where the Alliance tried to avoid such attacks.<ref name="In the Name of the Rebellion" />

[[File:Rebel_Fleet_above_Scarif.jpg|thumb|left|300x300px|The Rebel Fleet attacking Scarif.]]
Most of the Rebellion's leaders chose not to act on the team's information. However, Jyn, Andor, and K-2SO, along with a team of soldiers of the Alliance naming themselves [[Rogue One]] [[Battle of Scarif|attacked]] the [[Citadel]] on [[Scarif]] and snuck themselves inside the facility to steal the original plans to the Death Star. The Alliance on [[Yavin 4]] was informed, and [[Admiral]] [[Raddus]] rushed in with a large chunk of the [[Rebel Alliance Navy|Alliance Fleet]] to assist. The infiltrators managed to get the plans with one loss and sped to the top to transmit them to Raddus's ship, the ''[[Profundity]]''. With the help of the ''[[Lightmaker]]'' ramming a disabled Star Destroyer into the shield gate, the plans made it to the flagship, but as the fleet attempted to escape, Vader's [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Devastator]]'' came in and stopped them getting away before too many ships got out.<ref name="Rogue One" />

The ''Profundity'' was disabled and the rest of the fleet was either destroyed or scattered. But inside the ''Profundity'', Rebel troopers put the plans onto a data tape and transferred them to Princess Leia Organa aboard the ''[[Tantive IV]]'' (docked inside the flagship) before Lord Vader could intercept it. The vessel escaped and jumped out of the [[Star system|system]].<ref name="Episode IV" /> Although the team was successful in their mission, they died completing their task along with [[Director]] [[Orson Callan Krennic]] and any other Rebel or Imperial forces, as the Battle of Scarif ended with the Death Star destroying the surface of the planet.<ref name="Rogue One" />

=====Secret mission to Tatooine=====

{{Main|Secret mission to Tatooine|Dissolution of the Imperial Senate}}
[[File:Devastatortantiveiv.png|thumb|right|250px|The Imperial Star Destroyer ''Devastator'' chases down the ''Tantive IV''.]]
Racing towards the [[desert]] [[planet]] of [[Tatooine]] with the plans in hand, Organa hoped to enlist the help of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, Vader caught up with the ''Tantive IV'' and captured the ship in a space [[Secret mission to Tatooine|battle]] over the planet. [[Darth]] Vader's forces boarded Organa's ship, forcing her to hide the plans of the Death Star in the memory banks of the [[R2-series astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]]. R2, along with the [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]], used an [[escape pod]] to escape to Tatooine, where they were captured by [[Jawa]]s who then sold them to moisture farmer [[Owen Lars]], uncle of [[Luke Skywalker]].<ref name="Episode IV" />

While Skywalker was cleaning the droids, he stumbled upon part of the message in R2-D2 and became interested. However, R2-D2, operating under the programming that he was the property of Master Kenobi, escaped and tried to find Kenobi. After an encounter with [[Tusken Raider]]s in the [[Dune Sea]], Skywalker met up with Kenobi. R2-D2 then played for Kenobi and Skywalker Organa's desperate plea for help. The two soon discovered that Imperial stormtroopers had attacked the Jawas who had sold Skywalker and his uncle the two droids in a vain search for the Death Star plans. Skywalker raced back to the [[Lars homestead|Lars moisture farm]] to find his home burned and his aunt and uncle killed by Stormtroopers. He then accompanied Kenobi to [[Mos Eisley]], where, after using subterfuge to get past Imperial troops, the two negotiated with [[Captain]] [[Han Solo]] and first mate [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]] to take them, the droids along with the Death Star plans to Alderaan aboard the [[Corellian]] [[YT-1300 light freighter]] the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Emperor Palpatine used the princess' rebel affiliation to his advantage in [[Dissolution of the Imperial Senate|dissolving the Imperial Senate]].<ref name="Episode IV" />

{{Main|Destruction of Alderaan}}
[[File:AlderaanCracking-GoM.png|thumb|left|300px|Alderaan at the moment of its destruction.]]
While in Imperial custody, Princess Organa was transferred to the Death Star, where she was interrogated and tortured by Vader for the location of the Alliance's hidden base. When she refused to succumb to torture, Tarkin decided to get the information out her by threatening to destroy Alderaan, the princess' homeworld. Fearing the loss of Alderaan, but not wanting to give up the Alliance's location, Organa lied to Tarkin and declared that the Alliance was located on the planet of Dantooine.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Governor Tarkin, confident in his victory, continued with the operation to destroy Alderaan regardless, stating that Dantooine was "too remote" for an effective demonstration of the Death Star's abilities. Thus, Alderaan was [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] by a single blast from the Death Star, an event that killed billions and showed the true might of the Empire.<ref name="Episode IV" />

=====Rescue of Princess Leia=====
{{Quote|I'm Luke Skywalker, I'm here to rescue you.|Luke Skywalker to Leia Organa|<ref name="Episode IV" />}}
{{Main|Rescue of Princess Leia}}
Following Alderaan's destruction, Tarkin sent a scout team to Dantooine to ascertain whether there was indeed a Rebel base there. Meanwhile, the ''Millennium Falcon'' had arrived out of [[hyperspace]] to find out that Alderaan had been destroyed. Fearing that they would be identified by a lone [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]], they attempted to stop it but not before being trapped aboard the Death Star by a [[tractor beam]]. Skywalker sought to [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescue Organa]] while Kenobi went alone to disable one of the tractor-beam generators on the station.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Acme-CircleIsNowComplete.png|thumb|right|300px|Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi duel for what is to be the final time aboard the Death Star.]]
When Tarkin learned that Organa had deceived him and that there was only a long-abandoned Rebel base on Dantooine, he ordered her execution. But before the order could be carried out, Skywalker rescued her. An escape commenced throughout the Death Star's corridors. As Skywalker, Solo, Organa, and Chewbacca finally reunited with C-3PO and R2-D2 and made it to the hangar to escape aboard the ''Falcon'', Skywalker watched as Kenobi faced off against his former Padawan, Darth Vader. Kenobi let down his guard, allowing himself to be struck down by [[Darth Vader's lightsaber|Vader's]] [[lightsaber]], instantly becoming one with the Force.<ref name="Episode IV" />

{{Main|Alderaan vigil rioting}}
[[File:Anandra_and_Santigo.png|thumb|left|300px|Alderaanians on Coruscant rioted against and fled from the Empire in the wake of "the Disaster" that destroyed their homeworld.]]
Rioting took place after the destruction of the planet Alderaan by the Empire. Rumors of what happening began reaching the Alderaanian population on Coruscant who became enraged when images followed the rumors, confirming Alderaan had been destroyed. The vigils turned into rioting which lasted for several days until the security forces and the stormtroopers were sent in to restore order. However, as the troops marched into the streets, the stormtroopers opened fire with their blasters. The crowds dispersed, and the following day, the police arrested anyone caught out in the streets. The day after that, stormtroopers began taking Alderaanians in to be questioned.<ref name="OTLD">{{InsiderCite|151|One Thousand Levels Down}}</ref>

The ''Millennium Falcon'' escaped the Death Star, but not before being pursued by several TIE fighters. The ''Falcon'' defeated the fighters, but it was all a ploy devised by Tarkin and Vader, who had placed a homing beacon aboard the ''Falcon'' that led the Empire to the Rebels' hidden base on Yavin 4. By sending the TIEs after the ''Falcon'', it made it seem like the Empire did not want the ship to get away. Despite Solo's confidence they would be safe, Organa feared that they were indeed being followed. Upon their arrival at the [[Great Temple]], the Rebel Alliance analyzed the technical readouts.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Organa and several other officers,<ref name="SW 2020 24">[[Star Wars (2020) 24|''Star Wars'' (2020) 24]]</ref> including General Dodonna, conceived an attack plan in which [[snub-fighter]]s would target the exhaust port weak point with [[proton torpedo]]s.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Poe_Dameron_21_Star_Wars_40th.png|thumb|right|300x330px|The Battle of Yavin was one of the Rebel Alliance's first victories.]]
As the Death Star was entering range to fire its [[superlaser]], Rebel starfighters took off in a desperate attempt to destroy the battle station. As per the plan, the starfighters moved to skim down the Death Star's trench and follow it to the thermal exhaust port, knowing their torpedoes could reach the Death Star's main reactor, set off a chain reaction, and destroy the battle station. In the intense [[Battle of Yavin|battle]], the [[Rebel pilot|pilots of the Rebel Alliance]] faced off against Imperial starfighters and [[turbolaser]]s while also trying to make attack runs on the exhaust port. Having underestimated the Alliance chances, Governor Tarkin refused to send more reinforcements to deal with the Rebel starfighters. He also ignored an underling's warnings of the threat to the exhaust port and continued with his assault upon Yavin 4.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Rebel pilots continued to be destroyed one by one by Vader and other Imperial [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|pilots]]. Being nearly the last of the Rebel assault force, Skywalker, [[Biggs Darklighter]], and [[Wedge Antilles]] made one final run against the exhaust port. Vader shot down and killed Darklighter and forced Antilles to retreat, and was mere moments away from shooting down his son before Solo entered the fight with the ''Millennium Falcon''. Vader was driven out of the battle by Solo, giving Skywalker one final shot at the exhaust port. The attack succeeded, and moments later, the Death Star exploded, taking with it millions of Imperial lives. Yavin 4, along with the Alliance, was saved.<ref name="Episode IV" />

====After Yavin====
=====Evacuation of Yavin 4=====
{{Main|Evacuation of Yavin 4}}
[[File:RebelsEvacuateGreatTemple-PrincessLeia1.png|thumb|left|250px|Admiral Gial Ackbar leading the evacuation of Yavin 4.]]
After a key victory over the Empire and the [[Royal Award Ceremony]], the Rebellion was forced to evacuate Yavin 4 in order to find a new base of operations as the Imperials knew their location. All Rebel fleets arrived at the planet in order to assist with the evacuation, and Dodonna began working to find a new planet to settle on.<ref name="Leia 1">[[Princess Leia 1|''Princess Leia'' 1]]</ref>

=====Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan=====
{{Main|Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan}}
During the [[Evacuation of Yavin 4|evacuation]] of Yavin and following the Disaster, the Empire sought out surviving Alderaanians in an attempt to eradicate them, and Organa set out with Rebel pilot [[Evaan Verlaine]] and astromech droid R2-D2 to rescue them. They first fled from the Rebel base on Yavin 4, over the objections of General Dodonna. After escaping, they made their way to the Naboo, where they rescued a group of Alderaanian musicians called the Melodic Order, before heading for Sullust. Unknown to Organa and her followers was that the Empire was tracking their every move whose efforts were spread throughout the galaxy.<ref name="Leia 1" />

In the time after Alderaan's destruction, [[Lindon Javes]] rose through the ranks of the Rebel Alliance by hunting Imperial [[capital ship]]s.<ref name="Javes databank">{{Databank|lindon-javes|Lindon Javes}}</ref>

=====Imperial disarry and attacks=====

Following the destruction of the Death Star, the Empire was put into a state of disarray<ref name="SW1" /> and desperately started to work to demonstrate its authority.<ref name="The Angle">{{StoryCite|story=The Angle|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> The Empire started launching attacks against Rebel targets, and [[Nashtah Squadron]] flew on several missions over the course of a week, often with poor intelligence. They lost three pilots at the [[battle of Portocari]], while [[Banshee Squadron]] lost two pilots at [[Phindar]]. Right afterward, the Empire was to send a task force to the [[Jovan system]]. In the wake of the loss of the Death Star at Yavin, the Empire mobilized its forces and reorganized TIE pilots into the same command system.<ref name="Last Call" /> Meanwhile, the Rebellion would take advantage of the Empire's disarray.<ref name="SW1" />

The loss of the Death Star was a major blow to the image of Imperial power, with the Rebellion spreading video of their victory across the [[DarkNet]]. In response to its loss in reputation, the Empire began to crack down on criminal elements it had previously ignored to begin to restore its image,<ref name="The Angle" /> although the [[Hutt Clan]] was allowed to continue on with its operations.<ref name="Darth Vader 1">[[Darth Vader (2015) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 1]]</ref> In one city, a small Imperial detachment arrived at the [[Luck Luck Freidal's casino|illegal casino]] operated by a man who went by the name "[[Luck Luck Freidal]]." While Freidal had been bribing Imperial officers to keep his operation running, the detachment sent to the casino ignored their previous cooperation, killed Freidal, and claimed all the casino's earnings as Imperial property.<ref name="The Angle" />

====Luke Skywalker's early missions====
=====Skirmish over Llanic=====
{{Main|Skirmish over Llanic}}
While [[Lieutenant]] Skywalker was on board the ''[[Desert Jewel]]'' on a mission to rescue [[Drusil Bephorin]] and to open up a supply line, he entered a skirmish between a Star Destroyer and a [[Kupohan]] starship.<ref name="HTTJ">''[[Heir to the Jedi]]''</ref>

=====Mission to Rodia and Fex=====
{{Main|Mission to Rodia (Luke Skywalker)|Mission to Fex}}
In order to keep the war in the Rebel Alliance's favor, Luke went to open a secret smuggling supply line on [[Rodia]]. Luke, after this, went on a biological research mission to Fex for [[Fayet Kelen]] in order to make some money. There, he came across some brain sucking creatures which had killed the former team and taken the [[Harvester (starship)|Harvester]]. Luke and Fayet's daughter, [[Nakari Kelen]] successfully took back the ship and gathered necessary data for Fayet's company.<ref name="HTTJ" />

=====Mission to Pasher and Denon=====
{{Main|Mission to Pasher|Mission on Denon}}
Despite being warned by Organa not to trust Kelen blindly, Skywalker set off for Pasher with Kelen and R2-D2 to receive intel from her father about their destination and the necessary equipment to survive its atmosphere. They then went to Denon to help the natives there.<ref name="HTTJ" />

=====Rescuing Drusil Bephorin=====
[[File:Brazilian_Heir_to_the_Jedi_cover.png|thumb|right|300px|Luke Skywalker and Nakari Kelen]]
Skywalker and Kelen were on Denon to rescue Drusil Bephorin from Imperial custody. They first contacted the [[Kupohan]] spy [[Sakhet]], whose [[Sakhet's son|son]] was on the ship Skywalker rescued over [[Llanic]]. She gave them valuable intelligence on Drusil's whereabouts during each day, and Skywalker and Kelen observed her visit to the local park. They then planned to extract her when she was visiting a cafe. With R2-D2 chirping as a signal, they took out the security droid and distracted the bodyguards before taking Drusil and transporting her through the sewer.<ref name="HTTJ" />

They took her off Denon and to [[Kupoh]], where one of the Kupohan spies, [[Azzur Nessin]], was stationed. Nessin owned a company called [[Nessin Courier & Cargo]] and was not happy about harboring highly wanted rebels. But they made a deal with him anyway. But one of the company's workers, [[Migg Birkhit]], had told the Empire of their whereabouts, and Drusil was too late to find out. They found Migg with a [[Gotal]] [[Imperial Security Bureau|ISB]] agent called [[Barrisk Favvin]]. They captured both of them and kept them hostage in their [[hotel]] room. However, another Kupohan worker called [[Ruuf Waluuk]] had also contacted the Empire, and this time the Empire sent a blockade. As Skywalker, Kelen, and Drusil were about to leave, Ruuf and a [[Devaronian]] mercenary came and killed Nessin. Skywalker and Kelen then killed the two and fled the system with Drusil.<ref name="HTTJ" />

The trio went to [[Omereth]], where [[Major]] [[Bren Derlin]] and his team were waiting with Drusil's family, which they had separately rescued. But they were intercepted by bounty hunters who had tracked Derlin's team to Omereth, and they were shot down and crashed into the ocean. They swam to shore and confronted the bounty hunters. Despite the formers' victory, Kelen was killed by one of the bounty hunters while Luke rescued and completed his mission by reuniting Drusil with her family.<ref name="HTTJ" />

====Further engagements====
[[File:Tatooine_rebel_army_SWC.png|thumb|left|300px|Rebel personnel invested in the battle to liberate Tatooine.]]
At some stage of the conflict, the [[battle of Distilon]] and [[battle of Perimako Major]] were waged, with rebel pilots Derek Klivian and Wedge Antilles taking part in both.<ref name="Rendezvous Point">{{StoryCite|story=Rendezvous Point (short story)|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref> In 0 ABY,<ref name="Timelines" /> a [[Tatooine rebel cell|mercenary unit]] on Tatooine was asked to assist a [[Tatooine garrison|garrison on Tatooine]] with [[Attack on a Tusken Raider camp|dealing with]] a Tusken Raider [[Unidentified Tusken Raider camp|camp]] in order to keep its grip on the planet, while also helping the Alliance to Restore the Republic who requested support in a [[Mission to recover medical supplies|mission]] to recover medical supplies from the Imperial aligned Hutt Clan on the planet of [[Dandoran]]. Later, the Empire began a crackdown on Jawas who were seen to be in engaged in widespread unlicensed trade, which led a local detachment of Rebels on Tatooine to protect the Jawas from the Imperials.<ref name="Commander" />

Shortly after, Imperials and Rebels began searching an old freighter, which led to a confrontation between the Empire and Rebel Alliance as well as the Hutt Clan after defeating mercs who were supporting the Rebellion. Meanwhile, Vader ordered a search for his missing shipment that was taken by the [[smuggler]] [[Liana Kor]] on Dandoran. On the planet, the Empire had gained the formal senator [[Johhar Kessen]], who was held prisoner in a base in order to prevent his rescue, only for the Rebels to rescue him later. The Rebels had to return to Yavin 4 in order to prevent the Empire from finding out about the data centers that were left behind and were each destroyed by the Alliance that led to a ground battle for control of Yavin 4, while [[Er'Kit]] and [[Takodana]] both saw battle between the Empire and Rebels. [[Project Blackwing]] would also go awry during that time and create the [[Undead Troopers invasion]].<ref name="Commander" />

====An Empire besieged====
[[File:BigThreeAssault-2015StarWars1.png|thumb|right|250px|Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia attacking Weapons Factory Alpha.]]
With the Empire put into a state of disarray after the Death Star's destruction and the Rebel Alliance using it to their advantage,<ref name="SW1" /> the rebels launched over a dozen attacks against vital Imperial installations. Rebel bombing runs were taken [[Bombing of the Kuat shipyards|against]] the [[Kuat shipyards]] [[Bombing of the Imdaar supply base|and]] the [[Imdaar supply base]].<ref name="Skywalker Strikes, Part IV">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref> Solo, Organa, and Skywalker led an [[Assault on Cymoon|assault]] and infiltration against [[Weapons Factory Alpha]] on [[Cymoon 1]], the largest [[weapons factory]] in the galaxy.<ref name="SW1" />

After the failure to prevent both the destruction of the Death Star and Weapons Factory Alpha, the Empire was forced to increase its supply of weapons, while Palpatine sent Vader as his [[envoy]] to negotiate with the Hutt Clan. This was in order to enlist Jabba the Hutt as a reliable weapons dealer. Vader, however, also took the moment to enlist two bounty hunters: he sent [[Boba Fett]] to learn more about the pilot who destroyed the Death Star, while he hired [[Krrsantan]] to learn more about a contact he had seen speaking to Palpatine, [[Doctor]] [[Cylo]].<ref name="Darth Vader 1" />

====Attempt to kill the Emperor====
{{Main|Arrth-Eno Mission}}
[[File:SidiousBodyDoubleKilled-2015StarWarsAnnual1.png|thumb|left|250px|Eneb Ray guns down Palpatine's double.]]
Around 0 ABY,<ref name="Timelines" /> a rebel spy named [[Eneb Ray]] was stationed on Coruscant, posing as a tax collector under the name Tharius Demo. Leia Organa gave him Intelligence on a group of convicted former Senators in the [[Arrth-Eno Prison Complex]] and asked him to help save them. When he infiltrated the complex, he discovered they were going to be personally visited by Emperor Palpatine. He then brought together all the spies on Coruscant, and they attacked the sovereign as he was talking to the doomed Senators. Palpatine attempted to escape the battle, and Ray chased him to the roof, where he gunned him down. However, that Emperor was a decoy, and the real one revealed himself as his [[shuttle]] came over. Furious, Ray charged over and launched himself into the shuttle as it started to fly away. As the shuttle with Ray and the Palpatine flew away, the complex exploded, killing everyone inside. The Emperor then revealed his true identity by attacking Ray with Force lightning and throwing them off the shuttle.<ref name="Star Wars Annual 1">[[Star Wars Annual (2015) 1|''Star Wars Annual'' (2015) 1]]</ref>

====Battle of Vrogas Vas====
{{Main|Battle of Vrogas Vas}}
{{Quote|Darth Vader! Lay down your weapons! You are surrounded!"<br />"All I am surrounded by is fear. And dead men.|Darth Vader responds to a Rebel commando company ordering his surrender|<ref name="Vader Down 1" />}}
Vader was collecting information to hunt down Luke Skywalker and had recently learned his name from Boba Fett. Then one of Vader's rivals [[Commander]] [[Karbin]] located Skywalker and let the location slip to [[Doctor]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Chelli Aphra]]. Aphra then told Vader this and he went to Skywalker's location at [[Vrogas Vas]] where three squadrons of [[X-wing starfighter]]s, [[Red Squadron]], [[Blue Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Blue Squadron]], and [[Yellow Squadron]], including Skywalker. Lord Vader battled the many X-wings picking them off one by one until there were barely any left to face him. Skywalker, in an attempt to end his opponent, crashed his X-wing into Vader's [[TIE/Advanced starfighter|TIE Advanced]] and they both crashed onto the planet.<ref name="Vader Down 1" />

[[File:Fear_and_Dead_Men_AtG.png|thumb|right|250px|Rebel troopers engage Darth Vader on Vrogas Vas.]]
Meanwhile, the rebels at the [[Rebel Refueling Base]] were deploying troops, vehicles and [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wing bombers]] to take Vader out for good. The rebel Y-wings of [[Gray Squadron]] started bombing his position, only for their target to begin hurling pieces of the ground at them, taking them out one by one. As reinforcements arrived, he then found himself surrounded by hundreds of [[Rebel trooper]]s and dozens of rebel [[tank]]s ready to kill him. Vader stood still, and the rebels looked confused until they found their grenades activated through the Force. Hundreds of them died in one barrage of explosions, and the rebels scattered. He cut through many of them and deflected tank shots back at them. Vader also got hold of a cannon and used it on the [[T-47 airspeeder|airspeeders]] of [[Cyan Squadron]].<ref name="Vader Down, Part III">[[Star Wars (2015) 13|''Star Wars'' (2015) 13]]</ref>

Meanwhile, Skywalker roamed the desert, looking for any sign on help from the rebels. While searching, he found an ancient [[Jedi Temple (Vrogas Vas)|Jedi Temple]], but, before he could learn more, he ran into [[0-0-0]], a deadly protocol droid who was painted gold to look like C-3PO. Triple Zero stunned Skywalker and was joined by Aphra, who wanted to redeem her reputation with Vader by catching Skywalker. While, Han Solo then engaged Aphra to save Skywalker, Leia Organa took a squad to attempt to end Vader once more. However, mercilessly slaughtered them first, but let Leia go in order to attract more rebels. Leia then ordered the Y-wings of [[Amber Wing]] to start bombing the area. As they did they were met by Karbin's forces which had arrived at Vrogas Vas to clean up. Commander Karbin attempted to take Skywalker away but Lord Vader wouldn't let him take the prize and engaged the other cyborg. They battled it out until Vader lured Karbin onto a natural stone bridge and used the Force to throw Aphra's ship into it. Vader went down there to finish Karbin off when the ''Millennium Falcon'' rode off with Skywalker, Leia, Solo, and a captured Aphra.<ref name="Vader Down, Part VI">[[Darth Vader (2015) 14|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 14]]</ref>

====Attack on Sunspot Prison====
{{Main|Prison siege at Sunspot}}
[[File:SunspotPrison-2015StarWars16.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sunspot Prison was targeted by Eneb Ray.]]
Eneb Ray, who had formally attempted to kill the Emperor, was now physically and mentally scarred. He felt that the Imperial prisoners held by the rebels were not worthy to live, and so he brought a team of [[IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid|IG-RM droids]] together and they attacked [[Sunspot Prison]], where many Imperials were being held by the Rebel Alliance. They broke into the control center, killed the [[warden]] and then started to execute the prisoners. Leia Organa and [[Sana Starros]] were present on in the prison after bringing the captured Doctor Aphra to the there. They intervened with Ray's executing and Dr. Aphra helped them take him down and arrest him. The mercenaries killed many of the prisoners, and the rebels were forced to abandon the prison. Later, [[Task Force 99]] came to the prison to find it empty. [[Kreel]] ordered a new mission to kill the rebels.<ref name="Rebel Jail">''[[Rebel Jail]]''</ref> They later fought rebel forces during a [[Skirmish on the Ghost Moon|skirmish]] on the [[Ghost Moon]].<ref name="SW21">[[Star Wars (2015) 21|''Star Wars'' (2015) 21]]</ref>

====Mission to Crait====
{{Main|Mission to Crait}}
[[File:CraitMission-TheStormsOfCrait1.png|thumb|right|250px|Han Solo fending off the members of Task Force 99.]]
With their base on Yavin 4 gone, the Alliance sent Skywalker, Organa, Solo, Chewbacca, Antilles, and some other rebels to the abandoned rebel base on Crait. They met up with a miner called [[Trusk Berinato]] who showed them around. When satisfied, they started setting up defenses there until Trusk double-crossed them and Task Force 99 came to take them down. The rebels engaged the elite squad and defeated them before leaving Crait.<ref name="Storms of Crait">[[The Last Jedi – The Storms of Crait 1|''The Last Jedi – The Storms of Crait'' 1]]</ref>

====Advancement into the Mid Rim====
The Rebel Alliance, bolstered by their victory at Yavin, launched a military [[Mid Rim Retreat|campaign]] in the [[Mid Rim Territories|Mid Rim]]. It was amongst the largest operation the Rebel Alliance had conducted, using military units, such as [[61st Mobile Infantry|Twilight Company]], and thousands of starships. But after nine months of fighting on many worlds, that had seen the Alliance establish many bases, Rebel High Command decided the fleet was overextended and the campaign would maintain defense of their captured territories. Not long after, the forces started a retreat and the battle companies evacuated their bases.<ref name="Twilight" />

====Mon Calamari Fleet====
=====Mutiny on Mon Cala=====
{{Main|Mutiny on Mon Cala}}
Skywalker, Organa, Solo, and Admiral [[Gial Ackbar]] met up with Grand Admiral [[Dors Urtya]] of the [[Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet]] to discuss the transfer of the Mon Calamari ships into the rebel fleet, but they were interrupted by an Imperial patrol. After escaping, Urtya declined to involve Mon Cala, in fear that the planet would yet again be subjected to the Empire's wrath like they did when Raddus left following the [[Invasion of Mon Cala]].<ref name="SW 44">[[Star Wars (2015) 44|''Star Wars'' (2015) 44]]</ref> Leia decided to break King Lee-Char out of imprisonment so he could convince the people to revolt against the Empire.<ref name="SW 45">[[Star Wars (2015) 45|''Star Wars'' (2015) 45]]</ref> Luke, Han, C-3PO, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 infiltrated the [[Moncaladrome]] and kidnapped Moff [[Tan Hubi]] and enlisted [[Tunga Arpagion]], a [[Clawdite]] [[Changeling]], to turn into him.

Stormtroopers burst in and began a firefight, killing Lee-Char and Moff Tan Hubi, the rest escaping. They returned to Mon Cala, where Urtya took the recording of Lee-Char's last moments and played it to the fleet. This inspired the fleet to revolt and flee the system, with help from the Rebellion, to the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]]..<ref name="SW 49">[[Star Wars (2015) 49|''Star Wars'' (2015) 49]]</ref>

=====Assault on the Mako-Ta Space Docks=====
{{Main|Battle of Mako-Ta}}
[[File:BattleOverMakoTa-2015StarWars54.png|thumb|left|300px|The rebel fleet scrambled to defend itself against Vader's relentless assault on the Mako-Ta Space Docks.]]
The Alliance now had a new fleet of Mon Cala ships, including several MC75 and MC80 star cruisers and both ''Home One'' and ''Liberty'' type cruisers. the ships, however, were mostly unarmed. Trios, queen of [[Shu-Torun]], offered Shu-Torun engineers to help retrofit these cruisers to battle-ready status. When the ships were finished, Mon Mothma called together most of the leadership of the Alliance, including Dodonna, Ackbar, Organa, [[Davits Draven]], Syndulla, [[Bandwin Cor]], Skywalker, [[Vanden Huyck Willard|Vanden Willard]], Antilles, [[Lajaie]], and [[Bob Hudsol]]. The celebrations were cut short though, as the Imperial fleet codenamed [[Death Squadron]], led by Darth Vader and Admiral [[Kendal Ozzel]], jumped into the system.<ref name="SW 50">[[Star Wars (2015) 50|''Star Wars'' (2015) 50]]</ref>

The ships attempted engagement, but none of the Mon Cala cruisers could as the space station had locked them down, disabling their weapons and shields and locking the flight bay doors. This revealed Trios' treachery, as the whole time she was a spy for Vader, who now had most of the rebel leadership and a large portion of their fleet in his sights and began to pick them off.<ref name="SW 51">[[Star Wars (2015) 51|''Star Wars'' (2015) 51]]</ref> Luke was able to break his squadron free and officially dubbed them "[[Rogue Squadron]]" after Rogue One, joining Han Solo and Chewbacca on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="SW 52">[[Star Wars (2015) 52|''Star Wars'' (2015) 52]]</ref> During the battle, Leia and Draven led a group of rebels to infiltrate Vader's flagship, the ''Executor'', pretending to be Trios, and were able to steal codes to unlock their cruisers.<ref name="SW 53">[[Star Wars (2015) 53|''Star Wars'' (2015) 53]]</ref> However, the Dark Lord realized this and came down to stop them.

The ships were able to break free with the codes. While many were able to escape, the losses were heavy, with much of High Command dead including Dodonna, Draven, Hudsol, Lajaie, and Bandwin, along with over half of their cruisers and almost all of their starfighters.<ref name="SW 55">[[Star Wars (2015) 55|''Star Wars'' (2015) 55]]</ref>

====Mid Rim Retreat====
{{Main|Mid Rim Retreat}}
The rebel companies which once waded their way through the Mid Rim in triumph were now in full retreat. Companies, such as Twilight Company, [[Bitter Pill Company]], [[Sixty-Eighth Infantry|Fish Eye Company]], and the [[Twenty-First]] were rescuing Generals, making distractions on other worlds and helping the rebel fleet to withdraw from the Mid Rim. In [[3 ABY]], Twilight Company launched a campaign on [[Haidoral Prime]] and managed to extract the defecting [[Governor]] [[Everi Chalis]]. She offered her knowledge on the workings and weak points in the "Imperial War Machine." After her knowledge proved useful in the [[Coyerti campaign]], the High Command invited her, Captain [[Micha Evon]], and three others to [[Echo Base]] on [[Hoth]]. Meanwhile, rebel bases, such as [[Unroola Dawn]], [[Talrezan Four]], and [[Hope Station]] fell to the Empire, the Twenty-First fought on [[Bestine IV|Bestine]] and General [[Amrashad]] was killed. But despite the losses, the rebel fleet was almost completely withdrawn from the Mid Rim.<ref name="Twilight" />

====Hearts and minds====
{{Main|Mission to Yelsain|Ambush on a frozen moon|Massacre on Horford}}
{{Quote|In terms of muscle and firepower, the rebels have no hope of ever defeating us. But like I said&hellip; that was yesterday.

As the Galactic Civil War continued, the elite stormtroopers of Task Force 99 continued their operations against the rebellion even though Imperial supply lines had yet to recover from the disaster at Yavin, which largely forced the SCAR troopers to operate on their own. Furthermore, squad members were forced to watch as the galactic population increasingly turned its back on the Empire, greeting them with fear or hate instead of the love they had once enjoyed as the "bringers of order." All the while, the Empire turned to increasingly brutal tactics in its efforts to root out and destroy the Alliance.<ref name="For the Love" /> During or after [[2 ABY]],<ref name="Circa 2 Date">{{Marvel|url=articles/comics/star-wars-a-new-legacy-1-marvel-comics-history|text=Marvel Comics Celebrates Their History of Star Wars Comic Book Storytelling in 'Star Wars: A New Legacy' #1}} establishes the events of the story "[[For the Love of the Empire]]" take place after [[Task Force 99]]'s last appearance in [[Star Wars (2015) 61|''Star Wars'' (2015) 61]], which ''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]'' dates the events of to around [[2 ABY]]. As such, the events of the comic occur around 2 [['ABY-BBY' dating system|ABY]] at the absolute earliest.</ref> SCAR Squadron carried out a [[mission to Yelsain]] deep in the Outer Rim, where a [[Unidentified Rebel Alliance member|Alliance recuriter]] was working to sign local citizens up into the Alliance Military. With the recruiter taken out by team sniper [[Misty]], SCAR Squadron's other members under Sergeant Kreel revealed themselves to wipe away any remaining rebels, with Kreel slaying one individual who raised a blaster against him. Kreel congratulated the citizens of [[Yelsain]] for being freed from the grip of Alliance "terrorists" but was forced to recognize the people were not applauding his actions. Always in pursuit of rebel agents, subsequent operations carried out by SCAR Squadron included a march through a swampy environment, a mission to a rocky area, a flight over lava near a city, and movement through a rainy, smokey location. During their missions, the stormtrooper squad needed to scavenge to survive and killed enemies whenever they grew homesick or hungry.<ref name="For the Love" />

[[File:AbandonedTrooper-ForTheLoveOfTheEmpire.png|thumb|left|300px|The Galactic Civil War would prove to be a battle of hearts and minds, in which winning the love of the people would help establish victory for the Rebel Alliance.]]
During Task Force 99's expeditions, rebels were often only revealed to the squad when they ambushed, something that Kreel believed was cowardly and proof the rebellion would not win the war on its own merits. On one occasion, the squad ventured through the frozen environment of an [[Unidentified frozen moon|unnamed moon]], where rebel personnel [[Ambush on a frozen moon|ambushed the squad]] with thermal detonators. Squad heavy hitter [[Zuke]] took the brunt of the explosion to protect his fellows. Unable to bury their comrade, the squad opened fire against the rebels and used Zuke's body as a carrier for incendiaries, which were used to burn out the hiding rebels. Three weeks later, the squad returned to the once-Imperial loyal planet [[Horford]], where they had once been celebrated as liberators. The love for the Empire displayed by the people of Horford had been proof to Kreel that the Empire was winning the war against the rebels and had been a fond memory for the soldiers of SCAR Squadron.<ref name="For the Love" />

However, the local population had turned against the Empire in the time since and grown fearful of stormtroopers, with Kreel himself seeing several children playing as the rebellion's Heroes of Yavin upon their return. The moment was eye opening for Kreel, who realized that stormtroopers like himself had failed to win the hearts and minds of the galactic population; while the Empire could outnumber or overpower the Alliance, the people themselves had already been turned to the rebel cause, which he took as a sign that the war was lost. With his squad consumed by fear that they would be remembered as villains, Kreel allowed them to [[Massacre on Horford|massacre the local population]] to work through their feelings, with Kreel deciding he would force the galaxy's peoples to either die or accept men like himself as bringers of order and law.<ref name="For the Love" />

A weaker force of troops and AT-STs disabled [[Perimeter Outpost Delta]], where [[Sergeant]] [[Hazram Namir]] of the Sixty-First Mobile Infantry and his two comrades [[Roja]] and [[Beak (individual)|Beak]] were based. They had to retreat to the main base with the other troops.<ref name="Twilight Company" />

The AT-ATs were met with the T-47 airspeeders of [[Rogue Squadron]] and [[Corona Squadron]], which slowed the vehicles and took out three of them including [[Blizzard 1]] which an airspeeder crashed itself into it as a last-ditch effort. Despite the large resistance from the two squadrons, the AT-ATs destroyed the shield generator, and Vader and his elite [[Cold weather assault trooper|snowtroopers]] entered the base. Vader soon ran into Sergeant Namir, his two comrades, Everi Chalis and the unconscious Captain Micha Evon. He slaughtered Evon and the two poor soldiers and then charged towards the ''Millennium Falcon'', which escaped before he could board it. Namir and Chalis escaped the system with Chalis's clearance codes,<ref name="Twilight Company" /> and the ''Millennium Falcon'', carrying Han Solo and Leia Organa, had to evade the blockading Star Destroyers.<ref name="Episode V" />

=====Sorin's campaign=====

{{Quote|I don't care where they run. My assignment is to hunt down Rebel survivors. My probes located them, my tanks flushed them out of their holes, now it's your job to finish them off.|General Sorin rebukes a snowtrooper captain|<ref name="Legends">''[[Legends of the Alliance]]''</ref>}}
In the days after the Battle of Hoth,<ref name="Return to Echo Base">{{FantasyFlightGames|url=en/news/2019/2/15/return-to-echo-base|text=Return to Echo Base}}</ref> the Empire sent General [[Octavion Sorin]] to root out any rebels still in hiding on Hoth, where a grouping of rebels encountered his forces and stole an Imperial shuttle. Tracking the ship, Sorin discovered the rebels had fled to the village of [[Haven (Ison)|Haven]] on the planet [[Ison]]. The rebel team frantically [[Mission to Sorin's Star Destroyer|returned to Hoth]] and boarded [[Sorin's Star Destroyer]] to try and prevent his [[Invasion of Ison|attack on Ison]], but the destroyer managed to jump into hyperspace. In the ensuing Imperial invasion of Ison, the rebels managed to crash Sorin's destroyer and confront the general himself on the ground, where they triumphed over Sorin and his troops.<ref name="Legends" />

=====Hunting Luke Skywalker=====
{{Quote|This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.|Darth Vader|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
[[File:Acme-Confrontation.png|thumb|left|250px|Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader engage in a long awaited duel on Cloud City.]]
After the Battle of Hoth, Organa, Solo, Chewbacca and C-3PO evaded the Imperial fleet on the ''Millennium Falcon'', outsmarting Captain [[Lorth Needa]], and were forced to flee to [[Bespin]] to find Solo's friend [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]]. Needa was killed by Vader as a punishment for his failure. However, the bounty hunter Boba Fett tracked the ''Falcon'', allowing the Empire to capture Leia, Solo, and Chewbacca by using Calrissian as an accomplice. Vader then arranged Calrissian to set a trap to capture Luke Skywalker by freezing him in [[carbonite]], but not before testing it on Solo. Luke came to rescue Leia and Solo and faced Vader, where they dueled and Skywalker learned of their true familial relation. Meanwhile, the Imperial forces found themselves betrayed by Calrissian and, at least initially, overwhelmed by [[Cloud City]] local authorities. The Rebel heroes escaped Imperial custody again, but not without cost. Skywalker lost his hand in his duel with Vader, while Solo was handed over to Fett for delivery to Jabba the Hutt. Bespin was also taken over by the Empire.<ref name="Episode V" />

Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, and Lando Calrissian went to a [[Fourth Division|flotilla]], where the [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate]] ''[[Redemption]]'' was stationed with a large number of freighters.<ref name="Episode V" /> The Alliance was scattered with no aim or safe communication. General [[Philap Bygar]] was dead.<ref name="Twilight Company" /> At some point, the Rebellion successfully [[Capture of transports in the Pyros system|captured]] four fully-laden transports in the [[Pyros system]], although that victory did not make up for the loss of the Echo Base ion cannon.<ref name="Rebel Files" />

====Operation Ringbreaker====
{{Main|Operation Ringbreaker}}
[[File:Twilight_Company_patch.png|thumb|right|250px|The logo of the 61st Mobile Infantry]]
The Sixty-First Mobile Infantry had suffered the loss of all their rebel officers with Captain Micha Evon being slaughtered by Vader on Hoth and their other officers being killed by Imperial spies in the [[Elochar sector]]. The company had taken refuge on [[Ankhural]] to regain their strength following their crippling blow. However, their Imperial turncoat Everi Chalis had a better idea. She planned up Operation Ringbreaker. The target was [[Kuat Drive Yards]] and it would required multiple attacks along the way to distract the Imperials. Although past rebel attacks on [[Kuat]] had failed miserably, Chalis's plan in theory could work. Led by newly promoted Captain Hazram Namir, Twilight Company [[Attack on Mardona III|attacked]] [[Mardona III]]. There, the dockyards had sustained severe damage from Twilight squads planting mines all around the tunnels. [[Najan-Rovi]] was the next target. Its dockyards housed Imperial luxury vehicles produced by [[Corellian Engineering Corporation|Corellian Engineering]].<ref name="Twilight" />

The naval trooper garrison was completely unprepared, and annihilated. No Twilight soldiers were lost, but several were injured. The loss of almost a hundred luxury vehicles forced the Empire to relocate resources away from Kuat, just as Chalis suspected. [[Obumubo]] was the site of the next assault. The garrison had been from fighting off the sea creatures of Obumubo for months and were experienced. The battlefield favored the defenders and the garrison expertly defended the fort. In the initial landing, 2 Twilight soldiers and a medic drowned after jumping from the dropships. Another dozen died in the first assault. It took two more days for the siege cannons to be prepped on the fluid landscape and the cannons brought down the garrison at last.<ref name="Twilight" />

Nakadia would be one of the worst assaults for the Company. Nazrim knew that it would be a tough fight to take the synthetic armor facilities, but he never expected what came next. Namir left [[Everi Chalis]] behind on the [[Thunderstrike]] and accompanied the squads on the first assault. The Company did multiple night raids from the stalks. The strategy worked, but exhausted the soldiers and had to leave some injuries unattended. [[Maediyu]] and others returned with bloody eyed and the medics confirmed his suspicions. It was not pesticides that were affecting the soldiers, but military bio-weapons. Namir told the squad leaders about it and told them to be careful. Sixteen more soldiers fell to airspeeders spraying it before their origin point was located. A squad attacked and burned the facility to the ground. Twilight then destroyed the factories and left [[Nakadia]] as star destroyers arrived. Both the [[Battle of Naator]], and the [[Battle of Xagobah]] would also be victories for the 61st. Although, they did sustain casualties. Next, Namir personally selected twenty soldiers for a [[Attack on the Kuliquo belt asteroid mines|sabotage]] of the machinery in the [[Kuliquo belt]]. The operation was a complete success.<ref name="Twilight" />

====Siege of Inyusu Tor====
{{Main|Siege of Inyusu Tor}}
Meanwhile, [[Prelate]] [[Verge]] and [[Captain]] [[Tabor Seitaron]], who sought to bring justice to Chalis for defecting to Alliance, were attempting to predict Twilight Company's next move. Operating aboard the [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Herald]]'', the pair whittled down possible targets to a handful of worlds, including Sullust, and prepared each for an anticipated attack. Verge positioned multiple [[TIE/IN interceptor]] [[squadron]]s near the worlds, including [[Vixus Squadron]] near Sullust.<ref name="Twilight" />

Twilight Company jumped out of [[hyperspace]] aboard their [[starship]]s, the [[CR90 corvette]] ''[[Thunderstrike]]'' and its escort the [[Braha'tok-class gunship|''Braha'tok''-class gunship]] ''[[Apailana's Promise]]'', a mere half million [[kilometer]]s from the planet in an effort to rapidly deploy [[dropship]]s to attack the [[Inyusu Tor mineral processing facility]] before Imperial orbital defenses could scramble a defense in time. The attack on the facility began with the assault on the [[Inyusu Tor]] [[mountain]]. News of Twilight Company's arrival at Sullust reached the ''Herald'', and Verge and Seitaron contacted Vixus [[Squadron]] to travel for Sullust.<ref name="Twilight" />

The Star Destroyer ''Herald'' arrived at Sullust, and the Imperial ground forces launched an assault on the factory of Inyusu Tor where Twilight Company, led by Captain Namir, were waiting for them. The battle was slow, but the Imperials continued to push back the rebel line. The ''Apailana's Promise'' returned to keep the ''Herald'' distracted for the forces on the ground. Everi Chalis deserted the rebels and made for the ''Herald'' on a stolen shuttle. When she landed in the hangar and was greeted by [[Prelate]] [[Verge]] and Captain [[Tabor Seitaron]], she detonated an [[ion bomb]], which forced the ''Herald'' to retreat from the atmosphere before the detonation sent it plummeting. Prelate Verge died on the ''Herald''. With the ''Herald'' out of the battle, Twilight Company could finish off the ground forces and claim victory on Sullust. The ''Apailana's Promise'' had barely survived, and Twilight Company had lost over a third of its troops, but overall, they had survived. The small [[Sullustan resistance]] led by [[Nien Nunb]] riled up an uprising in the nearby capital city of [[Pinyumb]], and revolutions broke out all over the planet, delaying any inevitable counterattacks from the Empire for weeks. Twilight Company used that time to replenish its numbers and plan their future.<ref name="Twilight" />

====Operation Starlight====
{{Main|Operation Starlight}}
[[File:AbDalisEruption-2020StarWars15.png|thumb|left|200px|An underground volcano erupts, destroying the ''Ultima II'']]
With the Alliance fleet scattered across the galaxy, General Organa and the Fourth Division conceived of a plan to reassemble the fleet. The Empire was able to intercept rebel codes and destroy the fleet [[division]]s whenever contact was made. Named after the [[Starlight Beacon]], "[[Operation Starlight]]" consisted of new codes sent out to the rebel divisions that the Imperials had yet to crack.<ref name="Star Wars 2" /> The rebel Pathfinders led a [[Heist at the Imperial Museum|heist]] at the [[Galactic Museum|Imperial Museum]] on Coruscant in order to acquire the [[Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II]] droid, which could translate the uncracked [[Trawak]] [[language]] into codes for the rebels.<ref name="Star Wars 9">[[Star Wars (2020) 9|''Star Wars'' (2020) 9]]</ref> The codes were given to [[Starlight Squadron]], who traveled near [[Felucia]] to deliver the codes to the [[Sixth Division]]. But the Sixth Division was [[Destruction of the Sixth Division|destroyed]] and the squadron was [[Ambush near Felucia|ambushed]] by the ''[[Tarkin's Will]]'' under Tarkin's old student [[Commander]] [[Ellian Zahra]].<ref name="Star Wars 10">[[Star Wars (2020) 10|''Star Wars'' (2020) 10]]</ref> Starlight Squadron was then joined by Skywalker when they answered a distress signal from the [[Eleventh Division]] at [[Ab Dalis]]. Given the coordinates, Starlight Squadron blew up the ground under the Star Destroyer ''[[Ultima II]]'', which was laying [[Battle of Ab Dalis|siege]] to the ground forces of the Eleventh Division. This caused an [[volcano]] to erupt underground and destroy the Imperial forces.<ref name="Star Wars 15">[[Star Wars (2020) 15|''Star Wars'' (2020) 15]]</ref>

Afterwards, the ''Tarkin's Will'' assaulted the [[Second Division]] at the [[Temporary rebel cell base]] on [[Panisia]]. In the ensuing [[Battle of Panisia]], the ship was then ambushed by the entire rebel fleet. The ''Tarkin's Will'' dove towards the surface of the planet, taking many rebel ships down with it and destroying the rebel base. Upon returning to engage the fleet, the Star Destroyer focused its fire on the ''Home One''. However, the ''Tarkin's Will'' was disabled under heavy Rebel fire and crashed to the surface of the planet.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 23">[[Star Wars (2020) 23|''Star Wars'' (2020) 23]]</ref> Surviving the crash, Zahra demanded that Organa herself confront her on Panisia's surface, leading to the Imperial commander's defeat.<ref name="SW 2020 24" />

====The Rebellion's public return====
{{Main|Unity Day attack}}
[[File:RebelFleetAttacksUnityDay-2020StarWars26.png|thumb|right|300px|The Rebel Alliance reveals its survival]]
With the Alliance on the run since the defeat at Hoth and hunted by Zahra's [[Hunter Fleet|fleet]], the public could be led to believe there had not been any major Rebel activity for months. As such, the [[Imperial Propaganda Office]] declared that the war had ended in an Imperial victory. After Zahra's defeat and the reunification of the Rebel Fleet, Organa decided the time had come for a public Rebel strike to showcase their movement still lived, choosing to [[Unity Day attack|attack]] the [[Empire Day|Imperial Unity Day]] parade on the planet [[Bar'leth]] in the Core itself. A public victory that proved the Alliance still stood, the Rebels also showcased their care in not hurting civilians and did not suffer a single causality. After destroying the parade, the Rebel Fleet escaped before Imperial defenses, a swarm of TIEs from the [[Imperial airbase|local airbase]], could reach them.<ref name="Star Wars 26">[[Star Wars (2020) 26|''Star Wars'' (2020) 26]]</ref>

====The second Death Star====
=====Setting the stage=====
{{Main|Battle of Endor#Prelude|DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|Escape from the Invincible Faith}}
{{Quote|Many Bothans died to get us this information.|Mon Mothma mentioning the sacrifice the [[Bothan]]s made for the Death Star II's location|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
The Battle of Hoth had shown the Empire that the rebels would up and abandon whatever their current gathering place was when faced with a surprise attack; while such surprise attacks prevented the rebels from being organized into a coordinated unit capable of effective counterattacks, as they were forced to scatter and retreat, the rebellion survived via its retreat. Indeed, constantly forcing the rebels to retreat from their current safe points and then pursuing small cells across the Outer Rim opened the Empire up to a propagandic hit: the people of the galaxy could see the Empire was unable to destroy the Alliance, and, in time, the regime would lose popular support to the surviving Rebellion.<ref name="Death Star 223">{{InsiderCite|223|The Death Star Stratagem}}</ref> While in theory a surprise attack on the current Rebel base or gathering point could succeed, if the rebellion and its leadership took enough losses in the surprise attack, such attacks had failed up to that point.<ref name="Zero Hour" /><ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="Episode V" /> Added to the fact that the main rebel force was proving hard to find, with any rebel rallying point the Empire discovered only belonging to a single cell instead of the overall Alliance, and how the almost never ending pursuit of such fleeing rebel cells would not end the conflict,<ref name="Death Star 223" /> Emperor Palpatine decided to adopt a new strategy.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:DeathStarTransp-SWE.png|thumb|left|300px|Emperor Palpatine decided that the incomplete second Death Star would serve as the perfect rebel trap.]]
Looking at the lessons of Hoth and remembering the Battle of Yavin, which had shown the Alliance would not flee with faced with a threat so dangerous it had no alternative to fighting,<ref name="Death Star 223" /> the Emperor decided he<ref name="Episode VI" /> needed a great target with which to lure out the Alliance, who would walk into their own destruction instead of being ambushed. Should the rebels not know they were entering a trap, Palpatine reasoned, he could present them with a grand target they had no choice but to act against. Fortunately for the Empire, Palpatine had such a target in the form of the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station]]: since the destruction of the First Death Star,<ref name="Death Star 223" /> the Empire had been building a second Death Star, which was set to complete its construction over the forest moon of [[Endor]]. On the order of Palpatine himself, the [[Bothan Spynet]] was allowed to get hold of its location. With many [[Bothan]] agents killed in the action, the supposed leak deceived the rebels into thinking they could take the Empire by surprise. Indeed, the leak was designed in such a way to make the rebels believe the new Death Star's superlaser was not yet operational. Palpatine also let it be known that he would personally enter the unfinished station to oversee its completion, turning it into an even greater target; it was the Emperor's hope that his presence<ref name="Episode VI" /> and the totemic symbolism of the new station would lure the Rebellion into the [[Endor system]], where they would be destroyed in a trap.<ref name="Death Star 223" />

The Rebel High Command rendezvoused to the [[Galaan system]], where they discussed the plan to destroy the Empire's new project.<ref name="Moving Target" /> The rebels of the [[MC80 Star Cruiser]] ''[[Invincible Faith]]'' intercepted a message from [[Moff]] [[Derrek Raythe]] concerning the Imperial fleet setting a trap at Endor. Commander [[Iden Versio]] of [[Inferno Squad]] let herself get captured by them to delete the message and then [[Escape from the Invincible Faith|fled from the ship]] to the [[Corvus (Raider II-class)|''Corvus'']].<ref name="Battlefront II">''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II]]''</ref>

=====Operation Yellow Moon=====
{{Main|Operation Yellow Moon}}
[[File:Yellow_Moon_crew.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Operation Yellow Moon]]
When in the Galaan system, the high command planned to launch [[Operation Yellow Moon]], named after [[Galaan]]'s yellow moon, which would distract the Empire so that the Alliance Fleet could mass at Sullust. This was led by Princess Leia Organa and a small team including the former Sullustan resistance leader Nien Nunb, [[Dressellian]] Major [[Lokmarcha]], the tech specialists [[Abednedo]], [[Antrot]], and [[Cerean]], and communications specialist [[Kidi Aleri]]. They traveled to [[Basteel]], [[Sesid]], and [[Jaresh]] on the ''[[Mellcrawler]]'' to place [[Hyperwave transceiver|hyper-transceivers]] which would distract the Imperial forces. On each planet they would narrowly evade the Imperial forces led by Captain [[Khione]] of the ''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer ''[[Shieldmaiden]]''.<ref name="Moving Target" />

The team then fled back to the Galaan system, where they scattered other ships before the ''Shieldmaiden'' arrived in pursuit. Captain Khione captured Leia and almost immediately interrogated her and her crew. But Lokmarcha had an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] device hidden inside his chest and activated it, disabling many of the ship's systems. It cost the Dressellian his life, but Leia and her team escaped, and the ''Shieldmaiden'' fell under attack by the same vessels Leia had told to flee. Leia impersonated the unconscious Captain Khione to get them off the ship, but the ruse was short-lived, and they were forced to flee to a nearby [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle]] called the ''[[Tydirium]]''. Antrot got onto the ''Mellcrawler'' and crashed it through the hull of the ''Shieldmaiden''. The others escaped the ''Shieldmaiden'' before it was destroyed. The many ships fled the system as another Star Destroyer arrived.<ref name="Moving Target" />

=====Saving Han Solo=====
{{Main|Rescue of Han Solo}}
Sometime later, Organa and Skywalker launched a [[Rescue of Han Solo|mission]] to recover Solo from Jabba the Hutt. They infiltrated the Hutt's palace separately, and Organa managed to free Solo from the carbonite. But Jabba refused to bargain and tried to kill Skywalker with a [[rancor]]. When Skywalker killed the [[Pateesa|beast]], they were sentenced to an execution at the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]]. They escaped after a struggle with the Hutt's guards, in which Organa killed Jabba.<ref name="Episode VI" />

=====The Battle of Endor=====
{{Main|Battle of Endor}}
{{Quote|From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion.|Darth Sidious, to Luke Skywalker|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:BattleAtTheDeathStar-RotJ40-Prouse.png|thumb|left|300px|The Rebels battling the Empire over Endor]]
The Alliance fleet was assembling near Sullust, with reports reaching Emperor Palpatine. After Organa and the rest returned, Mothma and Ackbar briefed the fleet and soon launched into hyperspace to go into battle at Endor. The Rebels sent a [[Endor strike team|strike team]] led by Solo to take out the shield generator protecting the Empire's second Death Star. But the Emperor's trap was in motion, and the team was captured when storming the rear entrance. As the fleet arrived, expecting to find the space station defenseless, the shield was still up, and a large Imperial force trapped the Rebels. Solo's team had formed an alliance with an [[Ewok]] [[Bright Tree Village|village]], which allowed them to overrun and scatter the Imperial forces and destroy the shield.<ref name="Episode V" /><ref name="Episode VI" />

The Death Star II, meanwhile, was firing on Ackbar's cruisers, forcing them to engage Imperial Star Destroyers to stay out of range while Calrissian led fighters to destroy the Death Star's reactor. Skywalker had surrendered to Vader and was brought before Palpatine. He and Vader dueled, but when Skywalker refused to turn to the dark side of the Force, Palpatine tried to kill him, awakening Anakin Skywalker within Vader and causing him to turn on and kill his master resulting in the destruction of the Sith. On the ground, Inferno Squad was assessing the damage of the shield generator and cleared multiple Rebel teams. Calrissian and Antilles got to the reactor and wreaked havoc before fleeing back through the large exhaust port through which they had entered. The Alliance Fleet fled back to Endor as the Death Star exploded. Some cruisers stayed at the wreckage to clear off any remaining Imperial forces. The Alliance then celebrated their victory on Endor with the Ewok village.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Empire in turmoil====
{{Quote|The Empire is in disarray. That's obvious by the sheer number of splinter factions&mdash;we aren't fighting one enemy, but several dozen.|[[Caern Adan]] of [[New Republic Intelligence]]|<ref name="Alphabet Squadron" />}}
On the day after the Battle of Endor, the Rebel Alliance launched an [[Assault on an Imperial outpost|assault]] on an [[Imperial outpost (Endor)|Imperial outpost]] on the far side of Endor.

{{Main|Operation: Cinder}}
[[File:OperationCinder.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Admiral Garrick Versio and his daughter, Iden watching the satellites above Vardos]]
As the Rebel Alliance gained momentum, scattered Imperial forces across the galaxy including Captain [[Lerr Duvat]] and Admiral [[Garrick Versio]] received the Emperor's posthumous orders to implement [[Operation: Cinder]], a contingency plan to scour loyal planets<ref name="Shattered Empire 2" /> and rebellious worlds alike.<ref name="Alphabet Squadron" /> Targets included [[Vardos]], Naboo, [[Burnin Konn]], [[Candovant]], [[Abednedo (planet)|Abednedo]], and [[Commenor]] in order to throw the galaxy into chaos.<ref name="Shattered Empire 3">[[Shattered Empire 3|''Shattered Empire'' 3]]</ref> The attacks would consist of experimental [[climate disruption array]] satellites, which could create superstorms ravaging the targeted planet,<ref name="Battlefront II" /> and other tactics.<ref name="Palpatine Inside Intel">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-inside-intel-palpatines-contingency-plan|text=''Star Wars'' Inside Intel: Palpatine's Contingency Plan|int=Star Wars Inside Intel}}</ref> These satellites were made at [[Fondor Shipyards]].<ref name="Battlefront II" />

=====Battle of Fondor=====
{{Main|Battle of Fondor (Galactic Civil War)}}
[[File:Fondor_shipyard_attack.png|thumb|left|250px|Rebel forces at Fondor]]
When Admiral Versio's special force Inferno Squad was sent to make sure Moff Raythe got his satellites, the Alliance attacked the shipyard and disabled the Moff's Star Destroyer, the [[Dauntless (Imperial-class)|''Dauntless'']]. Inferno Squad, consisting of Iden Versio, [[Del Meeko]], and [[Gideon Hask]], defended the ''Dauntless'' from incoming [[UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft|U-wings]] along with the TIE fighters of the ''Dauntless''. After successfully protecting the ship from the rebel attacks, Iden boarded the rebel [[Unidentified MC80 Star Cruiser|MC80 Star Cruiser]] and wreaked havoc in the hanger. Iden then charged through the hallways toward the ship's ion cannons, killing any rebel who got in the way, and then she stormed the large room with the ion cannons and killed the rebel personnel controlling it.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

Hask then joined her, and they destroyed each ion cannon whilst holding off the rebel troopers trying to kill them. The last cannon fell out of the Star Cruiser and crashed into a CR90 corvette outside, making it launch itself into the Star Cruiser. Iden and Hask then got back into their TIE fighters and reentered the battle outside, where the ''Dauntless'' had regained power. They then took out the disabled docking clamps keeping it in, and the Star Destroyer broke free. The Rebel cruiser wasn't ready for this and quickly fell victim to the first barrage of turbolaser fire the ''Dauntless'' set loose, bringing about an Imperial victory.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

=====Mission to Pillio=====
{{Main|Mission to Pillio}}
Shortly after the [[Attack on Fondor]], Inferno Squad sent Del Meeko to destroy one of the Emperor's observatories located on the coral world of [[Pillio]]. His path crossed that of Luke Skywalker, who took out all of his men. Luke, however, did not kill him but helped him to the entrance. They then disabled the self-destruct system and got into the observatory. Luke took a compass with him, and Del decided to not destroy the observatory in the end.

=====Attack on Vardos=====
{{Main|Skirmish on Vardos}}
Inferno Squad returned to Vardos to find that it was one of the targets the Emperor had set for Operation: Cinder. Iden was furious that the Empire would attack her loyal homeworld and confronted her father, who was blindly going along with it. She and her team were ordered to extract [[Protectorate (title)|Protectorate]] [[Gleb]] from Vardos and no one else. However, when they went to get her out, Iden decided to let other civilians go with them. Hask was furious about this as they were disobeying orders. But despite his unbreakable loyalty to the Empire, Iden and Del just were not going with it anymore, and as he tried to stop them, Iden shot him in the knee and they fled with the civilians. Hask took Gleb back to Admiral Versio and reported the mutiny of his former peers.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

=====Battle of Theed=====
{{Main|Battle of Theed}}
Iden, Del, and their ship's crew turned themselves in to the Alliance, and Captain [[Shriv Suurgav]] of the [[MC80 Liberty Type Heavy Star Cruiser|MC80 ''Liberty'' Type Heavy Star Cruiser]] ''[[Restoration]]'' took them in. General Calrissian came to see them.<ref name="Battlefront II" /> Seventeen days after the events of Endor, Alliance forces [[Battle of Cawa City|clashed]] with Imperial forces on [[Sterdic IV]]. Princess Leia also undertook a diplomatic mission to Naboo to invite [[Sosha Soruna|Queen Soruna]] to align her planet with the [[New Republic]], the government created by the Rebel Alliance. Her mission coincided with an Imperial attack on Naboo led by Captain Duvat.<ref name="Shattered Empire 2" />

[[File:RaidAtTheWretchOfTayron-ShatteredEmpire3.png|thumb|right|250px|Fighting at the Wretch of Tayron]]
Rebel forces led by Solo and Chewbacca later [[Raid at the Wretch of Tayron|captured]] an Imperial Security Bureau facility on the [[Wretch of Tayron]]. There, they discovered information about Operation: Cinder and the attack on Naboo. General Calrissian offered Iden and Del to help them save Naboo before Captain Duvat could devastate the planet further with climate disruption array satellites. Lando Calrissian arrived in the cruiser ''[[Mellcrawler II]]'' along with the ''Restoration'' and [[Danger Squadron]] led by Shriv and included Iden and Del. They escorted the Y-wing bombers as they bombed Duvat's Star Destroyer ''[[Torment]]''. Once the bombers took out the shielding, the ''Restoration'' opened fire on the ''Torment'' and destroyed it.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

[[File:SWBF2_Battle_of_Naboo_Space.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rebel forces arriving at Naboo]]
However, the ''Torment''{{'s}} ground forces escaped and flew down and to Naboo's capital, [[Theed]]. The ''Restoration''{{'s}} forces flew down to meet them along with Leia's troops. They had Iden and Del help them get the power back to the palace for its secret weapon, an [[ion pulse]] to disable the enemy weapons. They got the power back and retreated to the Palace to activate the EMP and render the Imperial forces defenseless. Following their surrender, Iden and Del officially defected to the Rebellion. The Alliance forces were then deployed to disrupt other Imperial forces from carrying out Operation: Cinder.<ref name="Shattered Empire 3" /> Meanwhile, the Alliance pilot [[Shara Bey]] accompanied Luke Skywalker on a [[Mission to Vetine|mission]] to recover [[Great Tree (Coruscant)|Force-sensitive trees]] from an Imperial base on [[Vetine]].<ref name="Shattered Empire 4">[[Shattered Empire 4|''Shattered Empire'' 4]]</ref>

====Dawn of the New Republic====
{{Main|Iron Blockade|Rebellion on Akiva|Coruscant civil war|Emergency summit on Akiva|Declaration of a New Republic}}
[[File:New_Republic_canon.svg|thumb|right|250px|The New Republic, the successor to the Rebel Alliance]]
After the Battle of Endor, the Rebel Alliance set about rebuilding the Galactic Republic and promptly reorganized themselves into a restored government called the New Republic and broadcast the defeat of the Empire across the galaxy, urging star systems to join them in overthrowing the remnants of the Empire. The New Republic also liberalized the [[HoloNet]] and encouraged the creation of new media networks, such as [[Queen of the Core Network]].<ref name="Aftermath" /> The weeks and months after Endor saw Imperial remnant and New Republic leaders struggle for support, whether it be maintaining support or gaining it in the first place, throughout the whole galaxy.<ref name="After Endor" /> Indeed, with the Alliance military reconstituted as the [[New Republic Defense Force]], they saw extensive action against Imperial forces on [[Battle of Naalol|numerous]] [[Battle of Malastare (Galactic Civil War)|fronts]] [[Operation on Geonosis|across]] [[Battle on Sevarcos|the galaxy]], including [[Naalol]], [[Malastare]], [[Geonosis]], and [[Sevarcos]].<ref name="Aftermath" /> For the pilots of both sides in specific, the war became an unrelenting gauntlet of battles, missions, and skirmishes. Pilot squads were often equipped with a wide range of ships to meet whatever surprises a mission would call for.<ref name="After Endor" /> The Alliance's leader Mon Mothma became the New Republic's first [[Chancellor (New Republic)|Chancellor]]. While her position still held the emergency powers granted by Palpatine during the Clone Wars, Mothma planned to abolish them and to reduce the New Republic military once victory over the Empire had been achieved.<ref name="Aftermath" />

At some point, a civil war erupted over control of the [[Virgillia system]], with both the Alliance and Empire backing a specific side. While the Empire supported the [[Virgillia system's government|system government]], the Rebel-backed [[Virgillian Free Alignment]] triumphed in the end, leaving the Virgilla system free to join the New Republic.<ref name="TLJ: IC-S">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Incredible Cross-Sections]]''</ref> As news of the Empire's defeat spread throughout the galaxy, the Empire began to crumble as infighting among Imperial leaders became frequent, and continued losses to the ever-growing Republic prevented them from becoming a single unified force. Due to the lack of clear system of succession following the Emperor's demise, chaos and anarchy gripped the Empire. Several members of the [[Imperial Ruling Council]] took the opportunity to grab onto territory and tailed contradictory propaganda messages about the New Republic and the Emperor's survival. Early Imperial propaganda attempts claiming the Emperor was still alive by using an actor to pose as Palpatine collapsed after observers quickly realized that the person was an impostor.<ref name="Aftermath" />

Some Imperial forces attempted to restart droid factories on Geonosis but were discovered by the New Republic, which launched an [[operation on Geonosis]].<ref name="Aftermath" /> Elsewhere, [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Gallius Rax]] secretly assumed command of the Imperial fleets in the [[Vulpinus Nebula|Vulpinus]], [[Almagest]], [[Recluse's Nebula|Recluse's]], [[Queluhan Nebula|Queluhan]], [[Ro-Loo Triangle]], and the [[Inamorata]] nebulae.<ref name="LD" /> Taking command of the Super Star Destroyer ''[[Ravager]]'', Rax ordered Admiral [[Rae Sloane]] to convene an [[Akiva Summit|emergency summit]] on [[Akiva]] to discuss the future of the Empire. In secret, Rax and Sloane planned to eliminate his rivals within the Empire. Putting Rax's plans into action, Sloane organized an [[Imperial Future Council]] consisting of herself, Grand Moff [[Valco Pandion]], General [[Jylia Shale]], the Adviser [[Yupe Tashu]], and the financier [[Arsin Crassus]].<ref name="Aftermath" />

The Future Council meeting was discovered by the New Republic pilots Captain Wedge Antilles and Lieutenant [[Norra Wexley]]. While [[Mission to Akiva|scouting]] Akiva, Wedge was captured by Sloane. Before the Imperial Future Council could finish its proceedings, Norra organized a motley rebel cell consisting of her son, [[Temmin Wexley]], his [[B1-series battle droid]] [[Mister Bones]], the former Imperial [[loyalty officer]] [[Sinjir Rath Velus]], and the [[Zabrak]] bounty hunter [[Jas Emari]]. Working together, they inspired a [[rebellion on Akiva]] and disrupted the conference. Posing as an informant known as the Operator, Admiral Rax also supplied Admiral Ackbar with intelligence on Imperial fleet movements and the Akiva summit. As a result, New Republic forces attacked Akiva and captured General Shale and Adviser Tashu. However, Sloane managed to escape back to the ''Ravager'', having fulfilled Rax's orders. Following the events on Akiva, the New Republic reconstituted the Galactic Senate on its capital Chandrila.<ref name="Aftermath" />

Other incidents around that time included the [[Battle of Naalol]], the [[Battle on Mordal]], the [[Battle in Central City]] on the planet [[Uyter]], and the [[Battle on Sevarcos]].<ref name="Aftermath" /> The New Republic launched a [[Siege of Arkanis|siege]] of the Imperial stronghold [[Arkanis]], which eventually fell,<ref name="LD" /> and clashed with merciless Imperial squadrons during the [[Criigo insurrection]].<ref name="Squadrons" /> In the months following the Battle of Endor, Han Solo and Chewbacca embarked on a campaign to liberate the [[Wookiee]] homeworld of [[Kashyyyk]],<ref name="Aftermath" /> which had been subjugated by the Grand Moff [[Lozen Tolruck]], who had fitted the enslaved Wookiees with [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]] and treated them as an expendable slave labor force. After receiving intelligence from [[Imra]] that the Empire had reduced its presence on Kashyyyk, Solo and Chewbacca organized a task force of refugees and smugglers to liberate the planet. However, this information was a ruse set up by the Empire to trap them. Han escaped, but Chewbacca was captured.<ref name="LD" />

====Inferno Squad returns====
=====Mission to Takodana=====
{{Main|Skirmish on Takodana}}
About six months after their defection. Iden Versio and Del Meeko were now the New Republic's [[Inferno Squad (Resistance)|Inferno Squad]]. Leia Organa asked Iden to find her husband, Han Solo, on Takodana. Han was meeting with an Imperial defector called [[Ralsius Paldora]] who had valuable intelligence on Imperial interests and Chewbacca's homeworld of Kashyyyk. Han and Paldora were then met with dozens of stormtroopers, which they managed to take down. Once they got back to the ''Falcon'', Inferno Squad had arrived to support them against the TIEs and the [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]] and took them out thanks to the help of the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

=====Mission to Bespin=====
{{Main|Mission to Chinook Station}}
[[File:CloudCarDestroyer.png|thumb|left|250px|The refinery exploding near Chinook Station]]
With Paldora's intel, Iden and Del located their former Imperial colleague Gideon Hask, who would be the key to tracking Iden's father. They went to [[Chinook Station]] on Bespin and infiltrated the inside disguised as stormtroopers. However, when they got to the [[Overseer's Tower]] they were met with Hask's hologram, who knew they were coming. Hask flew out on a Star Destroyer, and Iden and Del were forced to fight their way down to find something to fly. They were forced to take a [[Storm IV Twin-Pod cloud car|Cloud Car]], and they rode it to the nearby refinery, where three Star Destroyers were refueling. They fired at the fuel tanks until the refinery detonated, bringing down the three Star Destroyers with it.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

=====Return to Sullust=====
{{Main|Destruction of an abandoned weapons depot}}
[[File:MissionSullust.png|thumb|right|250px|Lando and Shriv scouting the factory]]
Shriv Suurgav and Lando Calrissian went to a weapons factory there which should have been abandoned. But when they got in, they realized it was in full production. They fought their way through the assembly line and down to the control center, where Lando attempted to shut the place down. That, however, only set off the alarm. Lando compromised and sent Shriv to find them a way out whilst he went down to the Lava pumps. Lando sabotaged the pumps, and the factory started flooding with lava. Lando then ran out of the factory to where Shriv was waiting in an AT-ST. They drove it to the nearby ''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle, which took off last minute. Shriv and Lando were saved by Iden on the ''Corvus''.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

====Cerberon system campaign====
{{Main|Cerberon system campaign|Troithe operation|Attack on Troithe}}
[[New Republic High Command]] was terrified at the idea of [[Troithe]] being used as a shortcut between Core Worlds. As a result, they sent General Hera Syndulla with the ''[[Lodestar]]'' and its [[Barma Battle Group|fleet]] to combat Imperial forces there. Troithe was invaded by the 61st Mobile Infantry after a long and bloody [[Troithe operation|siege]]. Twilight Company took massive losses taking the capital, and Governor [[Hastemoor]] was killed during the battle. [[Catadra]] and [[Verzan]] were also taken.<ref name="Shadow Fall">''[[Shadow Fall: An Alphabet Squadron Novel]]''</ref>

The goal of taking Troithe also had another motive, to lure the [[204th Imperial Fighter Wing]] into a trap. [[Caern Adan]] designed a plan in which Troithe's garrison would be allowed to broadcast a distress message for Shadow Wing to pick up. Adan suspected they would try to use an asteroid to bypass Troithe's orbital defenses and wreck havoc on the planet. A large amount of Imperial Insurgents, led by acting Governor [[Fara Yadeez]], remained on Troithe, biding their time.<ref name="Shadow Fall" />

====Hunt for Shadow Wing====
{{Main|Hunt for Shadow Wing|Sabotage of the Deliverance|Battle at Chadawa}}
After the devastating [[Cerberon system campaign]], [[Soran Keize]] contacted [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]] and formally pledged allegiance to her and the remnant of the Empire. Sloane's first assignment for Shadow Wing was the destruction of disloyal Imperial groups. The [[Yomo Council]] was targeted for refusing to redirect its forces to the [[D'Aelgoth sector]] and not acknowledging the Regent on Coruscant. [[Dybbron III]], [[Kortatka]], and [[Fedovoi End]] were all destroyed as a part of [[Operation: Cinder]]. Shadow Wing gained many recruits from these planets because they offered surrender before the planet was destroyed. Soran's speech transmission was picked up at Fedovoi End, and Hera's Fleet pursued.<ref name="Victory's Price" />

Soran Kieze deployed many sabotage droids at Fedovoi End, [[Sabotage of the Deliverance|causing]] major damage to the Deliverance. However, the Deliverance continued to pursue. The Barma Battle group engaged them in several battles, such as [[Skirmish in the Ciaox Verith system]], [[Battle in the Red Yars system]],[[Third encounter with the Yadeez|Third encounter with the ''Yadeez'']], [[Fourth encounter with the Yadeez|Fourth encounter with the ''Yadeez'']], and [[Battle in the Ghonoath system]]. The pattern of Shadow Wing retreating, being rediscovered through a comm burst or a lucky find, then escaping again was repeated several times in these battles. During the [[Skirmish in the G'Tep'Noi system]], Yriqa Quell decided to reveal that she had joined shadow Wing.<ref name="Victory's Price" />

The [[Attack on Chadawa|Battle at Chadawa]] was caused by [[Governor]] [[Bordanivaux]]'s decision to separate [[Chadawa]] from Sloane. Soran Kieze contacted Colonel [[Madrighast]] about rendezvousing with Sloane, but he claimed that his unit would be protecting Chadawa. Chadawa was a unique planet, it had not been formed like most planets, but constructed by an ancient species billions of years ago. At "high tide" the planet's rings expelled massive amounts of radiation that made it impossible to fight in. Even at low tide, navigation and scanning was complicated. Chadawa had half a dozen ships protecting it, the largest being the Star Destroyer ''[[Unyielding]]'', which they positioned inside the planet's rings. Shadow Wing managed to push inside the rings. The New Republic was unable to get inside before the rings exploded.<ref name="Victory's Price" />

Shadow Wing was inside and started to probe Madrighast's defenses. The New Republic would cycle out one of its three squadrons to attack the ''Yadeez'' while the other two would patrol the system. Two of the [[Raider-class corvette]]s started deploying satellites to absorb radiation, then drop onto the planet. Meanwhile, Nath Tensent Wyl Lark, and others started broadcasting personal stories on open broadcast to mess with the TIE pilots. After many hours of prep, the New Republic launched its attack with [[Hail Squadron]], [[Flare Squadron]], and [[Wild Squadron]]. The A-wings and X-wings engaged first but suffered heavy losses. As the Y-Wings of hail squadron approached, Syndulla aborted the attack due to the particle count and incoming TIE's. Meanwhile, Commander Broosh and Colonel Kieze were discussing their plans. Broosh suggested a possible attack on the Star Destroyer, but Kieze knew that time was the only thing needed for the planet to fall. Suddenly, Lark challenged Kieze to a personal duel in the atmosphere. Kieze accepted. As they dueled, Tensent led another attack by Hail Squadron onto one of the Raiders. However, TIE's intercepted them and began slaughtering the Y-Wings. Two proton torpedoes hit the Raider, and only five of the Y-Wings escaped. The Y-Wings made an attack on the other Raider, but the Chadawan Imperial Star Destroyer arrived and began decimating both Shadow wing and Hail Squadron. Kieze received a message that Quell had returned, as well as the situation with the Raiders, and decided to end the duel. Wyl was shot down over one of Chadawan's moons.<ref name="Victory's Price" />

What followed was a three way fight between Shadow Wing, the New Republic, and the Chadawan Imperials. The Yadeez managed to retreat when Quell's ship arrived with extremely important data. The Unyielding and Deliverance circled each other with the Deliverance eventually winning. Chadawa was saved with the New Republic taking control of the planet.<ref name="Victory's Price" />

====Waves of change====
{{Main|Liberation of Kashyyyk|Imperial–Republic peace talks|Attack on Chandrila}}
[[File:WoTG-RaeSloane-Stormtroopers.png|thumb|left|250px|Grand Admiral Rae Sloane, the public face of the Empire]]
By [[5 ABY|the following year]], the war was turning in the New Republic's favor. The Republic launched a program to hunt down Imperial fugitives. New Republic forces also seized more worlds from the Empire including [[Arkanis]] and [[Nag Ubdur]]. Both sides also employed [[propaganda]]. New Republic media, such as Queen of the Core Network highlighted Imperial atrocities and suicide attacks on Nag Ubdur. In response, the [[Office of Imperial Promotion, Galactic Truth, and Fact Correction]] published posters and fabricated data depicting the New Republic as terrorists and criminals. Some criminals, like the reptilian [[crime lord]] [[Eleodie Maracavanya]] took advantage of the chaos to expand their criminal enterprises. Eleodie's power was boosted by the stolen Super Star Destroyer [[Liberty's Misrule|''Annihilator'']].<ref name="LD" />

Meanwhile, [[Grand Vizier]] [[Mas Amedda]] tried to maintain a semblance of control over Coruscant, which was experiencing a civil war. With the Imperial Security Bureau barely able to hold on to Coruscant, Mas attempted to surrender to the New Republic. However, Chancellor Mothma and Princess Leia rejected his terms and ordered him to find a way to secure the Empire's surrender. Elsewhere, Sloane assumed leadership of the Imperial forces in the Vulpinus Nebula as [[Grand Admiral]]. However, she served merely as a front for Gallius Rax, who was the true ruler of the [[Imperial Remnants|Imperial remnants]]. According to his instructions, Sloane convened the [[Shadow Council]] to promote the resurgence of the Empire. The Shadow Council consisted of the former [[Commandant]] [[Brendol Hux]], Grand Moff [[Randd]], General [[Hodnar Borrum]], and the Imperial propagandist [[Ferric Obdur]]. In private, however, Sloane distrusted Rax's agenda and undertook an investigation of the Imperial fleet inventory and Rax's background.<ref name="LD" />

Following the disappearance of Han Solo, Princess Leia solicited the services of Norra and her team in finding her husband. After refusing an order from Admiral Ackbar to abandon her search for Solo, Norra resigned from the New Republic military to search for Han. Norra's team and Solo teamed up on the planet [[Irudiru]] to capture and interrogate the [[Siniteen]] prison designer [[Golas Aram]], who was privy to a secret Imperial prison on Kashyyyk called [[Ashmead's Lock]]. Infiltrating Ashmead's Lock, Solo and Norra's team managed to free Chewbacca and a hundred other rebel prisoners including [[Brentin Lore Wexley]]. Norra, Temmin, Mister Bones, and the prisoners returned to Chandrila aboard Solo's ship, the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="LD" />

Meanwhile, Sinjir, Jas Emari, and the New Republic soldier [[Jom Barell]] stayed behind on Kashyyyk to liberate the planet from Imperial rule. They decided to hunt down Grand Moff Tolruck in order to disable the control module controlling the inhibitor chips. Unknown to the New Republic, the liberation of the Ashmead's Lock prisoners played into the hands of Fleet Admiral Rax, who had secretly implanted inorganic biochips into their heads. Rax then put into a motion a plan to assassinate the New Republic leadership on Chandrila. Following the [[Defense of Kuat|fall]] of Kuat and its shipyards, Sloane offered to enter into [[Imperial–Republic peace talks|peace talks]] with the New Republic. Believing the Empire was near defeat, the Galactic Senate accepted her offer.<ref name="LD" />

[[File:B-wing_vs_Kuat_walkers.png|thumb|right|250px|New Republic starfighters attacking Kuat Drive Yards]]
A month later, Sinjir tracked Grand Moff Tolruck down at [[Lozen Tolruck's island fortress|his island fortress]]. He disabled the [[control module]] controlling the inhibitor chips and rescued Jom from Imperial captivity. As a result, a [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|mass planetwide uprising]] broke out on Kashyyyk. Meanwhile, Solo and the rest of his team attacked [[Camp Sardo]], a slave-labor camp near the Wookiee city of [[Awrathakka]]. In a last-ditch defense, Tolruck ordered the orbiting Imperial Star Destroyers to bombard Kashyyyk. However, Princess Leia learned about the attack from the [[slicer]] [[Conder Kyl]] and convinced Captain Antilles and Admiral Ackbar to send ships there. They were aided by Solo and his team, who hijacked the Star Destroyer ''[[Dominion]]''. As a result, Solo, Chewbacca, and the New Republic ended the Imperial subjugation of the Wookiees.<ref name="LD" />

Meanwhile on Chandrila, Chancellor Mon Mothma organized [[Liberation Day (New Republic)|Liberation Day]] to celebrate the liberation of the Ashmead's Lock prisoners. These festivities were meant to precede the upcoming peace talks with Sloane. To entice more worlds to join the New Republic, the celebrations were broadcast live on HoloNet. With the help of his local agent [[Windom Traducier]], Rax transmitted a signal that forced the former prisoners to [[Attack on Chandrila|attack]] New Republic officials. As a result, numerous New Republic officials, including Chancellor Mothma and [[Commodore]] [[Kyrsta Agate]] were wounded while others, like General [[Crix Madine]] and [[Hostis Ij]] were rumored to be killed. Sloane turned against Rax after disagreeing with his dishonorable tactics.<ref name="LD" />

Following the attack on Chandrila, Rax seized power as [[Counselor to the Empire]] and ordered his Imperial armadas to assemble on the planet [[Jakku]] for a showdown with the New Republic. The attack on Chandrila dampened the New Republic's desire for peace talks with the Empire and discouraged numerous worlds from joining the new government. With the backing of Leia, Norra and her team embarked on a campaign to hunt down Admiral Sloane, who they believed was responsible for the attack on Chandrila. Meanwhile, Sloane joined forces with Brentin to hunt down and kill Gallius Rax. With the help of the bounty hunter [[Mercurial Swift]], they discovered that Jakku was Rax's homeworld.<ref name="LD" /> New Republic forces also repelled [[Invasions of Naboo|three Imperial attempts]] to retake Naboo.<ref name="Lost Stars">''[[Lost Stars]]''</ref>

During a meeting with the highest members of the New Republic, General [[Airen Cracken]] reported on major progress in the [[Western Reaches]]. Ackbar then commented on the situation along the [[Corellian Trade Spine]]. Six New Republic fleets were positioned along the Spine for rapid movement towards the Western Reaches. General [[Ria]] commented on the [[Xagobah campaign]]. General [[Si-Flachitt]] reported on [[Border skirmishes with the New Separatist Union|skirmishes]] with the [[New Separatist Union]]. Admiral [[Ho'ror'te]] began looking for allies within the [[Ravager's Rift]] in order to reinforce Ackbar's fleets. Coruscant remained untouchable. There were riots and other clashes, but [[Troithe]] had shown the cost of urban warfare in the [[Troithe operation]], and Coruscant had a much higher population.<ref name="Victory's Price">''[[Victory's Price: An Alphabet Squadron Novel]]''</ref>

One of the final battles of the war came with a [[Skirmish near Polaar|skirmish]] near the planet [[Polaar]], during which a Mon Calamari [[Battlecruiser|battle cruiser]] was damaged but escaped into hyperspace. The ship's damaged hyperdrive, however, led to it leaving hyperspace very close to Polaar, leading to it crashing onto the planet.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith">''[[Shadow of the Sith]]''</ref>

====Gallius Rax's hour====
{{Main|Gallius Rax|Contingency}}
For several months, Norra Wexley, her son, Temmin, and her team hunted for the fugitive Admiral Sloane. After [[Capture of Mercurial Swift|capturing]] the bounty hunter Mercurial Swift on [[Taris]], the [[Imperial hunter]]s learned that the former Grand Admiral had traveled to Jakku. Elsewhere, New Republic forces conducted mopping up operations against Imperial holdouts on Kashyyyk and Cloud City. Meanwhile, the remnants of the Empire waited on Jakku for a showdown with the New Republic. While Counselor Gallius Rax regarded the barren, desert world as an ideal testing ground for his forces, the harsh conditions sapped the spirit and strength of his forces. In addition, Rax recruited local orphans and street children into a fighting force of child assassins.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Unknown to his subordinates, Rax was the secret executor of the Emperor's posthumous Contingency plan to see the regime destroyed for its failure and then rebuilt in secret. As part of the Contingency, Rax had engineered the deaths of numerous other Imperial commanders. The final stage of the Contingency involved instigating a showdown between the Empire and the Rebellion above Jakku. Rax planned to destroy the planet and the two enemy fleets by throwing Sith relics down a borehole which led to Jakku's core, triggering a cataclysmic explosion. In secret, Rax planned to flee into the [[Unknown Regions]] with a select few Imperials including Brendol Hux, his son, [[Armitage Hux|Armitage]], and his child assassins.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Norra and her team soon discovered the Imperial fleet. While Norra and Jas Emari took an escape pod to search for Sloane, Temmin and Sinjir returned to Chandrila with news of the Imperial presence on Jakku. After learning of the Imperial presence, Chancellor Mothma went to the Galactic Senate to pass a bill deploying New Republic forces to Jakku. The vote failed to pass since it fell short of a majority of five senators. These senators had been coerced into voting against the bill by the [[Black Sun]] and [[Red Key Raiders|Red Key]] crime syndicates, who wanted to profit from the war. This vote coincided with the New Republic's efforts to relocate its capital to the Mid Rim agrarian world of Nakadia. Han Solo, Temmin, Sinjir, Conder Kyl, and Jom Barell managed to convince the senators to change their votes by rescuing Senator [[Nim Tar]]'s [[Nim Tar's child|child]] and offering them a pardon if they changed their votes during the re-vote on Nakadia. As a result, Chancellor Mothma secured the majority needed to send New Republic forces to Jakku.<ref name="Empire's End" />

====Showdown on Jakku====
{{Main|Battle of Jakku||}}
[[File:Battle_of_Jakku.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Battle of Jakku ended the war in the New Republic's favor.]]
A New Republic fleet led by Admiral Ackbar entered the space around Jakku and engaged Rax's Imperial fleet. The New Republic also deployed several ground forces to attack the main Imperial headquarters<ref name="Empire's End" /> and an Imperial weapons facility.<ref name="Battlefront">''[[Star Wars Battlefront]]''</ref> Other New Republic participants included the starfighter pilots Captain Wedge Antilles and Temmin Wexley, and Commodore Kyrsta Agate. As the battle raged, Norra joined forces with Sloane and Brentin to hunt down and stop Rax, who had traveled to the [[Jakku Observatory]] with Adviser Yupe Tashu to initiate the destruction of Jakku.<ref name="Empire's End" />

At first, the battle went in the Empire's favor. The Imperial fleet had formed a tight defensive formation around Rax's Super Star Destroyer ''Ravager''. This tight formation slowed the onslaught of the New Republic assault and allowed the ''Ravager'' to repeatedly bombard the New Republic fleet from the safety of its protective cordon. After the Star Destroyer ''[[Punishment]]'' broke formation and rammed the [[Starhawk-class battleship|''Starhawk''-class battleship]] ''[[Amity]]'' in a kamikaze attack, Commodore Agate positioned her ship ''[[Concord]]'' in the gap and bombarded the ''Ravager''. Despite being crippled by the Super Star Destroyer, Agate managed to use the ''Concord''{{'s}} powerful tractor beam to drag the larger ship to Jakku's surface. The New Republic ships and starfighters then disabled the ''Ravager''{{'s}} engines.<ref name="Empire's End" />

[[File:SWBF2_Lindsey_Corvette.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Captain Lindsey's corvette]]
In the midst of the battle, Iden Versio and Shriv Suurgav were responding to distress calls across the battle field, and responded to rescue Captain [[Lindsey]] and his crew after [[Lindsey's CR90 corvette|his corvette]] crashed and was surrounded by Imperial ground forces. With the help of bombardments from [[Starhawk Command]], they took out the two AT-ATs and took Lindsey and his team with the ''Corvus''. Iden and Shriv then went to a downed Star Destroyer and blew up the hanger to prevent incoming bombers from it. Once they returned to the ''Corvus'' they fell under attack by the ''[[Eviscerator]]'' led by Admiral Garrick Versio. Gideon Hask was also there in a TIE Interceptor, and Iden shot him down along with the other TIEs. Iden then crashed her X-wing starfighter onto the ''Eviscerator'' and went for her father. At the bridge she tried to convince him to go with her, but he denied and told her his time had come. Iden then escaped the ''Eviscerator'' in an escape pod as it crashed onto the surface.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

After the ''Ravager''{{'s}} commander Grand Moff Randd fled, the battle turned in the New Republic's favor.<ref name="Empire's End" /> New Republic forces then attacked the beleaguered Imperials on multiple fronts in space and on the ground. During the battle, Captain [[Ciena Ree]] crashed her Star Destroyer ''[[Inflictor]]'' onto Jakku's surface in an effort to deny the New Republic access to her ship.<ref name="Lost Stars" /> The New Republic was also aided by the bounty hunters Jas Emari, [[Dengar]], [[Embo]], and [[Jeeta]], who secured pardons for their efforts. Meanwhile, Sloane and her New Republic allies hunted down and killed Rax and stopped his plot to destroy Jakku. Sloane then fled with Brendol, Armitage, and Rax's child soldiers on a replica of the Emperor's yacht ''[[Imperialis]]'' to a set of secret coordinates in the Unknown Regions.<ref name="Empire's End" />

====The Galactic Concordance====
{{Main|Galactic Concordance|Imperial Instruments of Surrender}}
{{Quote|The Galactic Concordance, the peace treaty that brought an end to hostility, was at last signed and ratified after the last remnants of the Imperial fleet vanished following the Battle of Jakku. Former Imperial governors were invited to the New Republic, though many of them bore the weight of crushing reparations.|Janyor of Bith|<ref name="Propaganda">''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]''</ref>}}
[[File:GalacticConcordance-BattleOfJakkuLastStand4.png|thumb|left|250px|The Galactic Concordance marked the formal end of the Galactic Civil War.]]
The Battle of Jakku coincided with Mas Amedda's escape from house arrest in the Imperial Palace. With the help of a group of child resistance fighters known as the [[Anklebiter Brigade]], Amedda in his capacity as Emperor upon Rax's demise, went to [[Chandrila]] and sign the [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender]] and the [[Galactic Concordance]] with Chancellor Mon Mothma. These agreements formalized the Empire's capitulation to the New Republic and ordered all Imperial forces to cease fighting. Despite the decisive defeat of the Imperial fleet above Jakku and the signing of the Galactic Concordance, Imperial forces continued fighting on Jakku's surface and parts of the galaxy for months.<ref name="Empire's End" /> Following the battle, the [[Queluhan Nebula Imperial remnant|scattered remnants]] of the Imperial fleet regrouped at various locations including the Queluhan Nebula for a coordinated attack on the New Republic.<ref name="Lost Stars" />

A month after the Battle of Jakku, the remaining Imperial forces were confined to pre-determined boundaries in the [[Core Worlds]] and [[Inner Rim Territories|Inner Rim]].<ref name="Lost Stars" /> Under the terms of the Concordance, the defeated Empire was required to obey strict disarmament policies and pay war reparations, which the [[Inner systems' Imperial remnant|remnant in the Core and Inner Rim]] obeyed, confining themselves to the new set of borders. The Concordance also banned the recruitment and mobilization of stormtrooper forces, the abandonment of Imperial Academies, ceded the former galactic capital Coruscant to the New Republic, and outlawed [[torture]]. While the New Republic turned its attention to reshaping the galactic order, a remnant of hardliners that eventually relocated to the Unknown Regions and became the [[First Order]].<ref name="TFA VD" /> Despite the end of the Galactic Civil War, the New Republic had to contend with other new factions including the [[New Separatist Union]], the [[Confederacy of Corporate Systems]], and the [[Sovereign Latitudes of Maracavanya]], and some of the surviving Imperial splinter groups.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Some wealthy collectors, such as the [[Centrists|Centrist]] senator [[Ransolm Casterfo]] collected historical artifacts including Imperial helmets, banners, and armor. In addition, Rebel Alliance and Imperial banners, equipment, and other artifacts were sold at places, such as [[Chrome Citadel]]. Key Rebel leaders, such as Senator Bail Organa, Chancellor Mon Mothma, Princess Leia, and Luke Skywalker had a high level of respect and prestige among the galactic populace. Still, some like Casterfo regarded the extreme actions taken by Saw Gerrera's Partisans, and even some actions taken by the official the Rebel Alliance, as terrorist activities.<ref name="Bloodline">[[Bloodline (novel)|''Bloodline'']]</ref>

By [[28 ABY]], two factions had emerged in the Galactic Senate, the Centrists who favoured a stronger central government and the [[Populists]] who wanted member worlds to wield considerable sovereignty. Some Centrists admired the "Old Empire" and questioned the official New Republic accounts of the Battle of Yavin and the Galactic Civil War. Some even expressed skepticism that Skywalker had destroyed the first Death Star and suggested that it was the work of an Imperial traitor. Several Centrist senators including Lady [[Carise Sindian]]<ref name="Bloodline" /> and [[Erudo Ro-Kiintor]] worked as undercover agents of the First Order to subvert the New Republic from within.<ref name="BTA">''[[Before the Awakening]]''</ref>

Due to his role as Palpatine's right-hand, Lord Vader was widely reviled by much of the galactic population. As a result, his children Princess Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker withheld the full details of their parentage from all but a close circle of friends. After Lady Carise discovered Leia's true parentage, she manipulated Leia's friend Senator Casterfo into revealing Leia's connection to Darth Vader during a hearing to consider Leia's candidacy for the office of [[First Senator]]. Consequently, the Princess lost much support in the Senate and was forced to withdraw her candidacy. Later, Leia uncovered evidence that a paramilitary faction called the [[Amaxine warriors (New Republic Era)|Amaxine warriors]], a mere front to the First Order, were planning to attack the New Republic. However, her warnings were dismissed as warmongering by the Senate. Sensing another galactic war approaching, Princess Leia formed a paramilitary outfit called the [[Resistance]] to protect the New Republic.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Many of the soldiers and military officers in the First Order, including General Armitage Hux, were taught that rebel "terrorists" had stolen the future of the galaxy during the civil war. The First Order viewed the New Republic as too weak to save the galaxy from chaos and believed that the First Order had to save the galaxy from itself.<ref name="TFA VD" /> In the years leading up to the [[Hosnian Cataclysm]], an uneasy peace existed between the New Republic and the First Order.<ref name="Propaganda" /> A neutral buffer zone known as the [[Borderlands]] lay between the New Republic and First Order.<ref name="BTA" />

With the New Republic unwilling to take action against the First Order out of fear of another war erupting, General Organa's Resistance kept a watch over the First Order.<ref name="TFA VD" /> Following a series of skirmishes with the Resistance, the First Order destroyed the New Republic capital of [[Hosnian Prime]]. This ended the cold war and set the stage for [[First Order-Resistance War|open warfare]] between the First Order and the Resistance, the primary threat to the First Order's ambitions of restoring the Empire.<ref name="Episode VII">{{Film|VII}}</ref>

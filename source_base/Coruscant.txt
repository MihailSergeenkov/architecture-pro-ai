Serving as the [[capital]] of [[the galaxy]] since the ancient [[Standard day|days]] of the old [[Galactic Republic]], Coruscant was at the center of many [[Timeline of galactic history|historic events]], such as the [[Jedi Order]]'s [[Jedi-Sith War|conflict]] with the [[Sith]]. Although the planet [[Battle of Coruscant (Jedi-Sith War)|fell]] under Sith control for a [[time]], Republic forces ultimately [[Liberation of Coruscant|liberated Coruscant]] with the aid of the [[Jedi Knight]]s. Their victory was so decisive that at one point the Sith became all but extinct, replacing an [[Fall of the Old Republic|age of darkness and strife]] with the [[Democracy|democratic rule]] of the modern Galactic Republic. Retaining its status as galactic capital, it was on Coruscant where the [[Galactic Senate]] governed the galaxy for [[Standard century|centuries]], establishing an [[Republic Era|era]] of [[High Republic Era|peace]] that lasted for almost a [[millennium]] under the protection of the [[Jedi]] [[Law enforcement agency|peacekeepers]]. However, political intrigue wrought by corruption and [[Separatist Crisis|secession]] transformed Coruscant into a dangerous environment by the time of the [[Clone Wars]] with the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. On the [[Duel in Palpatine's office|eve]] of the [[New Order]], fulfilling a [[Grand Plan|grand scheme]], [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]], who was, in fact, the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth]] Sidious, declared the Jedi [[Treason|enemies of the state]], resulting in a [[Great Jedi Purge|galaxy-wide purge]] that all but destroyed the Jedi Order. Without the Jedi to oppose him, Palpatine dissolved the Republic and [[Proclamation of the New Order|declared]] himself [[Galactic Emperor]] to the applause of the now [[Imperial Senate]].

Coruscant continued to serve as galactic capital under the Empire, having become the Emperor's [[throneworld]], although Palpatine himself disappeared from public view for the most part, leaving the [[Standard day|day]]-to-day governing to his [[advisor]]s in the [[Imperial Ruling Council]]. The Empire maintained a firm hold on Coruscant throughout the Emperor's [[Imperial Era|reign]], but with his defeat at the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]] by the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], citizens of Coruscant [[Riot in Monument Plaza|celebrated]] by [[Coruscant civil war|revolting]]. Unable to command the [[Imperial Military|military]]'s allegiance as the rebels [[Declaration of a New Republic|restored]] the Republic, [[Grand Vizier]] [[Mas Amedda]]'s rule was limited to Coruscant while [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Gallius Rax]], the self-proclaimed [[Counselor to the Empire]], assumed ''de facto'' control of the collapsing Imperial government. Hoping to escape prosecution for war crimes, Amedda ultimately surrendered himself to the [[New Republic]] in return for amnesty. Following Rax's death at the [[Battle of Jakku]] in [[5 ABY]], Amedda signed the [[Galactic Concordance]]&mdash;a peace treaty recognizing the Empire's [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender|capitulation]] and the end of the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Amedda himself was permitted to return to Coruscant as the head of a [[Coruscant's provisional government|provisional government]]. Yet his authority was merely ceremonial; under the supervision of Republic overseers, he became a virtually powerless figurehead.

Unlike previous galactic governments, the [[New Republic]] broke with millennia of tradition by not establishing Coruscant as their headquarters, instead preferring to designate other member worlds with the status of galactic capital through an electoral system. During the [[New Republic Era]], Coruscant had become the capital of the New Republic as it was designed to handle and administer the galaxy's infrastructure. As part of the [[New Republic Senate]], Coruscant enjoyed full senatorial representation and, by the time of the [[Cold War]], was aligned with the worlds that identified as [[Centrists]]. However, by this point, Coruscant had actually fallen under the control of crime syndicates. Now a symbol of the disturbing realities of the galaxy's current era, gangs fought a [[Gang war on Coruscant|bloody war]] for control by the time after the [[Battle of Crait]].

During the [[First Order-Resistance War]], at least two sizeable battlegroup were deployed by the [[First Order]] to Coruscant in the apparent hope of seizing it and ruling the galaxy from the ecumenopolis as the Galactic Empire once did, however these efforts were defeated. In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Exegol]], various worlds sought to drive the [[First Order military]] from their soil. Coruscant was one such world where an [[Uprising on Coruscant|uprising]] took place as part of a [[Uprising against the First Order|galaxy-wide effort]] to overthrow the First Order.

[[File:Coruscant-SWJS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Coruscant was a bustling ecumenopolis, a city-covered planet.]]
Coruscant had four [[moon]]s<ref name="SWCL" />&mdash;[[Centax-1]],<ref name="Falcon 61" /> [[Centax-2]],<ref name="Falcon 26" /> [[Centax-3]],<ref name="TMCAFOF" /> and [[Hesperidium]].<ref name="Falcon 26" /> Coruscant orbited [[Coruscant Prime]], the only star of the<ref name="SWTVE" /> Coruscant system, with an [[Local year|orbital period]] of 365 [[Local day]]s, with each day lasting 24 [[Standard hour]]s.<ref name="AbEverything" /> The Coruscant week lasted five days, with each days with the name of each day relating to Coruscant is some way&mdash; [[Primeday]], named after Coruscant's sun, [[Centaxday]], named after Coruscant's primary moon, [[Taungsday]], named after the native Taung species, [[Zhellday]], named after the native Zhell species, and [[Benduday]], named after the [[Dai Bendu]] monks from Coruscant. When the need for a standardized time system between worlds arose in the Galaxy, the [[Galactic Standard Calendar]] was created, which standardized [[Standard day|days]] and [[Standard year|years]] to Coruscant's orbital period and rotational period respectively.<ref name="Falcon 61" /><ref name="Future of the Force Recon">{{RebelsRecon|sM_ZpTwSwuw|#2.09: Inside "The Future of the Force" &#124; Star Wars Rebels|sw_url=video/disneyxd-rebels-recon-inside-the-future-of-the-force}}</ref>

From [[Realspace|space]], the bright lights from [[Imperial City]], Coruscant's dense multi-layered planet-spanning [[city]] could be seen,<ref name="Episode I" /> though it was slightly dimmed by the planet's hazy cloud cover, which were part of the planet's [[Coruscant weather control|controlled weather patterns]]<ref name="Tarkin" /> affected by troposphere-piercing [[skyscraper]]s across Imperial City. While Coruscant's artificial climate was largely temperate in nature, parts of the planet occasionally experienced infrequent snowfall,<ref name="Fallen Star">''[[The High Republic: The Fallen Star]]''</ref> and in the [[Coruscant Underworld]] beneath Imperial City's surface levels, fierce microclimates began to form, forcing the Underworld's many residents to adapt.<ref name="Falcon 26" /> Similarly, Inside the Coruscant's tallest skyscrapers, enormous differences of [[temperature]] and [[Oxygen|air]] pressure from top to bottom produced unusual and unpredictable microclimates.<ref name="SWCL" />

[[File:Monument_Plaza_MandoS3.png|thumb|left|250px|The millennia of urban development on Coruscant left sparse evidence of its pre-ecumenopolis state.]]
[[Millennium|Thousands of years]] of development destroyed the planet's ancient [[mountain]]s and [[Water|seas]].<ref name="SWCL" /> [[Monument Plaza]] housed the top of Coruscant's last remaining mountain peak,<ref name="AbEverything" /> that being the peak of the [[Umate]].

Generations of city planners decided to keep the mountain peak. During the [[High Republic Era]], the surface around the peak was covered in greenery in an attempt to recreate the [[tree]]s and other [[plant]]s that would have been around the Umate's base many millennia earlier. Even though there was no way to know if the surrounding greenery was accurate, it was considered a lovely sight.<ref name="Light of the Jedi" />

[[File:CoruscantDefensePlatform-2020StarWars36.png|thumb|right|225px|Coruscant was protected by a series of Golan defense stations, such as the Golan-II Defense Platform.]]
Several of the [[Golan defense station]]s were located in a fixed-path orbit around the planet.<ref name="Coruscant Altaya" /> During the [[Imperial Era]], dozens of the [[Golan-II Defense Platform]]s and [[Golan III defense platform]]s were in orbit of Coruscant and other important Imperial Core Worlds for defense.<ref name="S&S">''[[Starships and Speeders]]''</ref>

[[File:Coruscant_landscape_RotS.png|thumb|left|250px|The urban sprawl that covered the surface of Coruscant was known as Galactic City prior to the Imperial Era.]]
Coruscant's surface was defined by its urban sprawl, which collectively was called [[Imperial City|Galactic City]]<ref name="UltimateSW" /> until it was officially renamed as Imperial City during the Imperial Era.<ref name="rebbegins" /> The dense city blocks were built on top of each other, with the lowest being [[Level 1]] and the highest reaching to [[Level 5127]].<ref name="SWCL" /> The lowest known habitable level was [[Level 5]].<ref name="The Right Wrong Turn" /> At its highest level, Galactic City's [[skyscraper]]s were built with many reaching 6,000 [[meter]]s into the atmosphere, with sleek, [[transparisteel]] edifices standing next to older [[duracrete]] structures.<ref name="AbEverything" /> As a hustling, bustling planet-wide city with an underworld full of dark alleys and an abundance of people, Coruscant provided the ideal conditions for a [[thief]] to prosper, especially targeting tourists from quieter planets.<ref name="VE">''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''</ref>

Galactic City was divided into sectors named by designated coordinates. Some sectors also had unofficial names; for example, [[sector H-46]] was the nicknamed of "Sah'c Town" due to the [[Sah'c family]]'s ownership of much of the sector. Sectors were further divided into zones, with zones determined by purpose, such as financial, senatorial, or industrial zones.<ref name="SWCL" />

[[File:Galactic_Senate.png|thumb|right|250px|The Galactic Senate's headquarters was located in the Federal District of Coruscant.]]
Under the [[Galactic Republic]], the [[Federal District]], also called the Senate District, was the center of [[Politics|political]] activity on the planet, as it was home to both the [[Imperial Senate Building|Senate Building]], seat of the [[Galactic Senate]], and the [[Imperial Executive Building|Senate Office Building]], where the [[Supreme Chancellor]] had [[Gender|his]] or her own set of [[Emperor's office|offices]]. It served as the main district for government buildings and institutions including the [[City Municipal Authorities Building]] and the [[Galactic Courts of Justice]]. The Federal District was also the location of the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]], headquarters of [[Jedi Order]], as well as ''[[500 Republica]]'', a massive residential tower home to the most powerful on Coruscant.<ref name="SWCL" />

Under the rule of the [[Galactic Empire]], the Federal District was transformed and heavily fortified, and the [[Jedi]] [[Jedi temple|Temple]] was repurposed as the Imperial Palace. The palace became a part of the "supreme triangle" of structures alongside the [[Imperial Inspectorate HQ]] and the massive [[COMPNOR arcology]],<ref name="Tarkin" /> which housed the city-block-sized [[ISB Central Office]] of the [[Imperial Security Bureau]].<ref name="AbEverything" /> Next to the Federal District was the [[Verity District]], which under the Empire housed the [[Hall of Adjudication]], the [[Hall of Imperial Register]], the [[Institute to Preserve Imperial History]], and the [[ISB Academy and Offices]].<ref name="Life Debt">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref>

[[File:Coruscant apartment view.png|thumb|left|250px|The surface of Coruscant featured towering skyscrapers and streams of speeder-filled air traffic.]]
The planet's [[skylane]]s directed the air-traffic of [[airspeeder]]s via auto-navigation system that moved the speeders along preprogrammed routes. As such crashes were extremely rare.<ref name="AbEverything" /> Precautions were taken though with and skytunnels incorporating bombproof shields and high-level tracking systems, and most structures on Coruscant had defensive shields to protect windows from stray and out-of-control vehicles.<ref name="SWCL" />

Owing to the planet's prominence in terms of galactic affairs, Galactic City housed numerous governmental offices and inter-galactic headquarters in its winding depths. The central planning strategy offices of the food giant [[Tagge Corporation]] could be found within the city, along with the droid research institutes funded by [[Cybot Galactica]], and the [[Bank of the Core]], one of the galaxy's largest financial institutions. The towers were symbols of power and authority, and the largest could hold populations of well over a million.<ref name="SWCL" />

[[File:Corsectrooper.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Coruscant was home to a population of trillions of beings, both humans and aliens, collectively known as Coruscanti.]]
The planet's residents were known as the [[Coruscanti]]<ref name="Tarkin" /> and of the estimated trillions inhabitants of the planet, 68% were believed to be [[human]].<ref name="AbEverything" /><ref name="Victory's Price" /> On Coruscant, wealth increased with altitude. The lowermost levels were devoid of light and abandoned, with Level 1 deemed uninhabitable and roaming with strange creatures and monsters; above them were lawless underlevels&mdash;countless blocks inhabited by billions of middle-class workers. The super-towers on Level 5217 remained home to the ultra-wealthy.<ref name="SWCL" /> Furthering this class divide, citizens who lived in the upper levels were able to breathe air that was filtered and clean, while lower-class inhabitants were forced to breathe the air of toxic fumes from [[factory]] and vehicular waste.<ref name="AbEverything" /> As such, most visitors to Coruscant chose to bring their own air supply to last the length of their stay.<ref name="SWCL" />

===Early history===
{{Quote|They say Coruscant used to be like any other planet, with oceans and mountains. But now it's just this, all the way down to Level 0.|Leia Organa|<ref name="The Right Wrong Turn" />}}
[[File:Faytonni_ep2dvd.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Though unconfirmed, Coruscant was believed to be the ancestral homeworld of the human species.]]
In ancient times, Coruscant was populated by two [[Sentience|sentient]] [[species]], the [[Taung]] and the [[Zhell]].<ref name="Falcon 61" /> Sometime in its distant past, Coruscant was home to a conflict between civilizations that fought for control of the planet.

As the planet expanded up, however,<ref name="The Right Wrong Turn" /> the buildings turned to ancient ruins that were buried. It was believed those low levels were left uninhabitable.<ref name="Convergence" />

Many different political systems held control over Coruscant during its existence, with these systems ranging from brutal empires and [[dictatorship]]s to [[Democracy|democracies]].<ref name="Light of the Jedi" /> Coruscant was one of the Galactic Republic's original Core World founders, and outmaneuvered its early rivals to become the economic and cultural engine of civilization as it expanded along newly chartered [[hyperspace route]]s. As these early hyperspace lanes became well-established trade routes, increasing numbers of [[alien]] species migrated towards Coruscant;<ref name="SWCL" /> this would accelerate the construction of new residential levels and sectors for the city-world's booming population even as the growth of its rivals slowed.<ref name="Shadow Fall">''[[Shadow Fall: An Alphabet Squadron Novel]]''</ref> Coruscant's effective status as the center of the Republic led to it being awarded the coordinates 0-0-0 on all standard navigation [[Star map|charts]].<ref name="SWCL" /> As the centuries passed, the Galactic City expanded and 5,000 [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Galactic Civil War]], it almost covered the entire surface of the planet.<ref name="Coruscant Altaya" />

In the Senate, Supreme Chancellor [[Finis Valorum]] was unable to respond to the [[Invasion of Naboo]]. Amidala, having learned from Palpatine about the corruption in the Republic government, called for stronger leadership by denouncing Valorum as a head of state.

[[File:ImperialMarch-AOTC.png|thumb|right|250px|The formation of the Grand Army of the Republic occurred shortly before the first battle of the Clone Wars.]]
The [[Clone Wars]] began with the [[First Battle of Geonosis]] in [[22 BBY]],<ref name="GA" /> when the [[Separatist Crisis]] that began with the establishment of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] escalated into open war between the Republic and the Separatists. In the same year, Amidala became the target of an [[Plot to assassinate Senator Amidala|assassination plot]] while she was on Coruscant opposing the [[Military Creation Act]]. The former queen-turned-senator was saved from the [[bounty hunter]]s [[Zam Wesell]] and [[Jango Fett]] through the efforts of Kenobi and Skywalker. While Skywalker escorted Amidala to Naboo for her protection, Kenobi [[Mission to Kamino (Separatist Crisis)|tracked]] Fett to the [[extragalactic]] world of Kamino where he discovered that an [[army]] of elite [[soldier]]s had been [[Cloning|bred]] from Fett's [[Clone template|genetic template]]. Kenobi followed Fett to [[Geonosis]] and learned that several commercial organizations pledged their resources to [[Count]] [[Dooku]] and the [[Separatist Droid Army]].<ref name="Episode II" />

Having learned of the Separatists' plan to attack the Republic, the [[Loyalist Committee]] gave serious consideration to using the [[Kaminoan]] [[clone trooper]]s as the basis for the [[Republic Military]]. Though the Jedi Order had long stood as the Senate's instrument of peace in the galaxy, the limited number of Jedi Knights prevented them from fighting a galactic-scale conflict on their own. [[Junior Representative]] [[Jar Jar Binks]], acting on behalf of Naboo in Amidala's absence, proposed a motion to grant [[Emergency Powers Act|emergency powers]] to the Supreme Chancellor. The Senate voted in favor of the [[Gungan]] politician's request, allowing Chancellor Palpatine to unilaterally create the [[Grand Army of the Republic]].<ref name="Episode II" />

[[File:CoruscantGuardssearching.png|thumb|left|250px|The Clone Wars saw the creation of the Coruscant Guard, an elite unit of clone shock troopers.]]
The Clone Wars became one of the most turbulent times in galactic history<ref name="Coruscant" /> and the first, full scale war in over a thousand years.<ref name="Episode II" /> As the capital of the Republic, Coruscant, already a hotbed of political intrigue, became a target for both military and political reasons. Situations and events that were unthinkable centuries before became commonplace.<ref name="Coruscant" /> Even prior to the beginning of the war, changes could be seen in the Republic. The Senate, already corrupt and bloated found it difficult to respond, delegating emergency powers to Palpatine. The chancellor himself brought changes such as implementing the use of his personal [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Red Guards]] instead of the [[Senate Guard]]s.<ref name="Episode II" /> During the Clone Wars, the [[Coruscant Guard]] was formed to serve as a clone [[Law enforcement agency|security force]] for the Republic capital.<ref name="Shock Troopers DB">{{Databank|imperial-clone-shock-troopers|Imperial clone Shock Troopers}}</ref> Composed of elite [[Imperial shock trooper|clone shock troopers]], the Coruscant Guard was led by [[Clone Commander]] [[Fox]].<ref name="Battlefront II" />

As the Grand Army and the [[Republic Navy]] spread across the galaxy to defend the Republic, the Jedi, long taking the stand of being peacekeepers instead of soldiers, led the clone [[trooper]]s as [[commander]]s and [[general]]s.

During the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine had the [[Zillo Beast]] from [[Malastare]] transported to Coruscant for scientific research, overruling the objections of his Jedi advisor [[Mace Windu]]. Palpatine ordered the Zillo Beast's destruction, but the creature broke out of the [[Republic Science and Technical Center]] and proceeded on a [[Zillo Beast incident|rampage]] across Coruscant's Senate district. The clone forces on Coruscant converged on the Zillo Beast, using [[poison gas]] to kill it while the Jedi protected the chancellor.<ref name="ZBSB">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast Strikes Back}}</ref> The [[Senate hostage crisis]] was carried out by bounty hunter [[Cad Bane]]<ref name="HC">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref> as part of a [[Hutt Clan]] plot to free [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure]].<ref name="EP">{{TCW|Evil Plans}}</ref><ref name="Hunt for Ziro">{{TCW|Hunt for Ziro}}</ref> While clone troopers had already started to see open use on Coruscant at that point,<ref name="DOM">{{TCW|Duchess of Mandalore}}</ref> the failure of Senate Guards during the incident became a justification<ref name="HC 30 Weapons">{{HelmetCollectionCite|30|Weapons & Uniforms}}</ref> for the continued<ref name="DOM" /> use of clones on the capital itself.

[[File:BombingEffects-HOBS.png|thumb|left|250px|A Separatist terrorist attack disabled power to large sections of Coruscant, including its government district.]]
The [[Confederate–Republic peace initiative]] was disrupted by the [[Bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid|bombing]] of Coruscant's [[central power distribution grid]] by planetside Separatist agents. Consequently, the Senate voted to [[Republic financial reform bill|deregulate the banking industry]], allowing the Republic to take on additional loans for the purpose of purchasing more clones for its army. Unbeknown to the Senate, the attack was supported by Senators [[Nix Card]] and [[Lott Dod]], whose respective organizations, the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan]] and the Trade Federation, profited from the Clone Wars.<ref name="HoBS" />

[[File:TempleSmoke-Sabotage.png|thumb|right|250px|During the late Clone Wars, the Jedi Temple was bombed in a terrorist attack.]]
Public opinion towards the end of the war, as represented by the citizens of Coruscant, began to turn against the Jedi. Protesters would gather in front of the Temple, blaming the Jedi for the military losses and the Jedi's loss of perspective as keepers of the peace. It was at that time that an [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|explosion]] occurred at the Jedi Temple docking complex that killed six Jedi and several clone troopers and Temple employees. The investigation by [[SP-4 ISC crime scene analysis droid|crime scene analysis droid]] [[Russo-ISC]] and Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano found that [[Letta Turmond]], the [[Marriage|wife]] of Temple employee [[Jackar Bowmani]], had fed him volatile [[NM-K reconstitutor|nano-droids]] which then exploded, killing Bowmani and causing the bombing at the Temple. Turmond was arrested and held at the Republic Center for Military Operations.<ref name="Sabotage" />

[[File:Littlegoldbook-Battle-of-Coruscant.png|thumb|left|250px|The Battle of Coruscant erupted at the height of the Clone Wars, with Republic forces engaging the Separatists in the planet's stratosphere.]]
Throughout the Clone Wars, Palpatine had remained a popular leader, remaining in office at the will of the Senate for far longer than his term technically allowed.<ref name="Episode III" /> During this period, Palpatine continued to consolidate and centralize his own power.<ref name="HoBS" /><ref name="Pursuit of Peace">{{TCW|Pursuit of Peace}}</ref><ref name="Citadel Rescue">{{TCW|Citadel Rescue}}</ref> By [[19 BBY]], the third and final year of the war,<ref name="GA" /> Coruscant's defenses were spread thin. The Separatists had been pushed back to the [[Outer Rim Territories]], and could not risk a direct strike at the heart of the Republic. Coruscanti citizens, used to having the war fought far from the capitol, were just as surprised as the [[Coruscant Home Defense Fleet]] when a Separatist assault force launched a surprise attack on the planet.<ref name="On the Front Lines">''[[Star Wars: On the Front Lines]]''</ref> During the [[Battle of Coruscant]], Chancellor Palpatine was captured and taken to the Separatist [[flagship]], the ''[[Invisible Hand]]'', where he was rescued by the Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]].<ref name="Episode III" />

After the death of Count Dooku, the Jedi on Coruscant focused their efforts on locating General [[Grievous]], the [[Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies]]. Despite the Republic's success in the [[Outer Rim Sieges]], relations were strained between the [[Jedi High Council]] and the Supreme Chancellor. Suspicious of the chancellor's motives, the High [[Jedi Council|Council]] tasked Skywalker with [[spy]]ing on Palpatine after he had made the young Jedi Knight the [[Office of the Chancellor]]'s representative on the Council. During the final days of the Clone Wars, [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] and the [[41st Scout Battalion]] departed from Coruscant to [[Battle of Kashyyyk|defend]] the [[Wookiee]] homeworld of [[Kashyyyk]]. Shortly afterward, the High Council dispatched Kenobi and his [[212th Attack Battalion]] to [[Utapau]], the planet where Grievous had been located by [[Clone Intelligence]].<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:MaceWinduDeath-ROTS.png|thumb|right|250px|With Anakin Skywalker's help, Darth Sidious killed Mace Windu on Coruscant.]]
With the Clone Wars nearing its conclusion, Chancellor Palpatine revealed his secret identity as the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] to Skywalker. Acting on Skywalker's report, Jedi Masters Mace Windu, [[Kit Fisto]], [[Saesee Tiin]], and [[Agen Kolar]] tried to [[Duel in Palpatine's office|arrest]] Sidious. The ensuing [[lightsaber duel]] resulted in the deaths of Kolar, Tiin, and Fisto; although Sidious was disarmed by Windu, he succeeded in killing the Jedi Order's champion due to the interference of Skywalker, who believed the chancellor's claims of possessing the power to save others from death. As a consequence, Skywalker renounced the Jedi and assumed the mantle of a Sith as Darth Vader.<ref name="Episode III" />

===The Galactic Empire===
====The end of the Republic====
{{Main|Proclamation of the New Order}}
{{Quote|So this is how liberty dies&hellip; with thunderous applause.|Padmé Amidala|audio=HowLibertyDies-ROTS.flac|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
[[File:Declaration.png|thumb|left|250px|The birth of the Galactic Empire was announced on Coruscant by Darth Sidious at the end of the Clone Wars.]]
As part of his endgame, Sidious issued [[Order 66]] to the entire Grand Army of the Republic,<ref name="Episode III" /> using hidden [[Behavioral modification biochip|inhibitor chips]]<ref name="Conspiracy">{{TCW|Conspiracy}}</ref> to force the clone troopers into killing their [[Jedi General]]s.<ref name="Aftermath episode">{{TBB|Aftermath (episode)}}</ref> On Coruscant, the [[Great Jedi Purge]] commenced with Vader and the [[501st Legion]]'s [[Operation: Knightfall|siege of the Jedi Temple]].<ref name="Episode III" /> With the clone army under his control,<ref name="Aftermath episode" /> Sidious claimed the title of [[Galactic Emperor]] after issuing the [[proclamation of the New Order]] in a [[special session of Congress]], declaring a new era of order and security under the first Galactic Empire. The Separatist attack on Coruscant had exposed the capital's vulnerability,<ref name="On the Front Lines" /> which, combined with Sidious' allegation of a "Jedi rebellion," compelled the Senate to support the [[Emperor]] and his [[New Order]].<ref name="Episode III" />

Yoda and Kenobi returned to Coruscant in the aftermath of Order 66. After learning of Skywalker's turn to the [[dark side of the Force]], the two Jedi Masters resolved to destroy the Sith. Kenobi left Coruscant to find his fallen apprentice, whereas Yoda remained on the capital to confront the Emperor. However, Yoda [[Duel in the Galactic Senate|failed to defeat]] Sidious; as a consequence, he [[Exile (punishment)|exiled]] himself to [[Dagobah]]. Meanwhile, Vader was [[Duel on Mustafar|grievously injured]] on [[Mustafar]] by Kenobi, resulting in his [[Cybernetics|reconstruction]] on Coruscant as a [[cyborg]].<ref name="Episode III" />

====Imperial capital====
{{Main|Imperial Era}}
=====Like a black hole=====
{{Quote|The Empire sat at the center of the galaxy like an enormous black hole&mdash;forever sucking wealth and resources inward. Coruscant glittered while those at the edges suffered.|[[Beaumont Kin]], ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Galactic Empire]]''|<ref name="Rise and Fall">''[[Star Wars: The Rise and Fall of the Galactic Empire]]''</ref>}}
[[File:Imperial_coruscant.png|thumb|right|250px|''Venator''-class Star Destroyers orbited Coruscant during its early days as the Imperial capital.]]
After Palpatine's accession to power, changes came quickly to Coruscant, formally renamed as Imperial Center, and the Galactic City to Imperial City.<ref name="rebbegins" /> The Jedi Temple and its surrounding serene complex became the home of the new Emperor. While the spires of the Temple remained in place, the rest of the structure was heavily remodeled and expanded with sloping facades and block-shaped additions. The entire area was known as the Federal District, with the Imperial Palace forming one point of the so-called supreme triangle.<ref name="Tarkin" /> As the Empire established itself in the greater galaxy, wealth and resources from across the stars were claimed and redirected towards the Core Worlds, particularly Coruscant, at great expense to those who were subjugated in order to secure that wealth.<ref name="Rise and Fall" />

The other two points on Coruscant were the byzantine COMPNOR arcology, which contained the headquarters of the Imperial Security Bureau, and the new Naval Intelligence Agency headquarters, a near-windowless complex which formerly housed the Republic's strategic center. The cityscape of Coruscant changed as well. Buildings were stripped of their elegant Republic dressings in favor of sleek lines and block-like surfaces, and many smaller buildings became engulfed into larger buildings. Some areas changed so quickly that they were not recognizable to those who had seen them only a few years before.<ref name="Tarkin" />

=====Tensions under the surface=====

[[File:Cal_taking_on_an_Imperial_gunship.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jedi Knight Cal Kestis faced Imperial forces on Coruscant.]]
However, the Empire's policies against non-humans and its tightening control of the population caused unrest, especially among the alien populations of the underworld.<ref name="1000 Levels">{{InsiderCite|151|One Thousand Levels Down}}</ref> The Empire's way of acting caused the movement in the streets to decrease, as the planet's population tried to avoid the Imperial authorities to avoid problems, as seen on specific on [[Level 2046]].<ref name="JS" /> The wealthy, however, moved around with much less stress.<ref name="Festive">{{Andor|What a Festive Evening}}</ref> Indeed, Coruscanti on other levels than 2046 also moved about with impunity,<ref name="Ever Been to Ghorman">{{Andor|Ever Been to Ghorman?}}</ref> with such Coruscanti&mdash;even if they were not wealthy&mdash;eager to enjoy the benefits of life on Coruscant.<ref name="Harvest">{{Andor|Harvest}}</ref> The [[Krrupt Gang]] kept hold of territory on [[Level 3726]], where they worked to keep even the Empire away.<ref name="SW 2020 36">[[Star Wars (2020) 36|''Star Wars'' (2020) 36]]</ref>

A large part of Kestis' team died in the [[Mission on Coruscant|confrontation]], in addition to Sejan, who was killed by the [[Inquisitor]] known as the [[Ninth Sister]] for supposed betrayal. The Ninth Sister was also killed when Kestis decapitated her. The acquired information was handed over to the [[Partisans]].<ref name="JS" /> As the [[Galactic Civil War]] took shape, the Empire began moving its [[Mon Calamari]] population on Coruscant. The aggressiveness of the forced relocations caused [[Old Market Sector riots|rioting]] to erupt in the [[Old Market Sector]], which was brutally put down by Imperial forces.<ref name="1000 Levels" />

[[File:UnderworldCop_Empire.png|thumb|right|200px|The Coruscant Security Force suppressed rioters on Level 3204 in the wake of Alderaan's destruction.]]
After the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of the planet [[Alderaan]] by the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], rumors of what occurred began reaching the [[Alderaanian]] population on Coruscant, most of whom lived on [[Level 3204]]. Vigils soon became heated and angry when it became known that the Empire had destroyed the planet. For several days, rioting continued until the combined efforts of the [[Coruscant Security Force]] and Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s restored order by firing indiscriminately into the crowds. The crowds, frightened, quickly dispersed. The following day, the Coruscant police arrested anyone caught out in the streets. The day after that, stormtroopers began going door to door stating that [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel]] [[Spy|spies]] had recruited local residents and that Alderaanians had to be taken in for questioning.<ref name="1000 Levels" />

====Planetary civil war====
{{Main|Coruscant civil war}}
{{Quote|It is a symbol of our indolence and torpidity. It is the moldering core of our overripe fruit and I wish to cut away such rot so as to preserve our sweet remains and of course the seeds within.|Gallius Rax|<ref name="Life Debt" />}}
[[File:ImperialCenter-ROTJ.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The death of Emperor Palpatine was celebrated by the citizens of Coruscant, who rebelled against Imperial rule.]]
In [[4 ABY]],<ref name="GA" /> the Rebel Alliance managed to defeat the Empire in the penultimate [[Battle of Endor]]. With both the Emperor and his apprentice dead, due to being killed during the destruction of the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station]], the citizens of Coruscant [[Riot in Monument Plaza|rejoiced]], pulling down statues of Palpatine, overwhelming the stormtroopers on the streets, and setting off chimes and fireworks.<ref name="RotJ">{{Film|VI}}</ref> Police forces on speeders quickly entered the plaza and opened fire on the crowds without warning, killing many who were present. Present Coruscanti erupted into full-scale rioting. Blaster fire and fighting soon erupted across the capital between Coruscanti and the Imperial security forces.<ref name="Aftermath novel">[[Aftermath (novel)|''Aftermath'']]</ref>

[[File:Grand_Vizier_Amedda.png|thumb|right|220px|Grand Vizier Mas Amedda struggled to maintain control over Coruscant as the Empire crumbled around him.]]
In the ensuing months the [[New Republic]] was formed and re-established the [[New Republic Senate|Galactic Senate]] on [[Chandrila]].<ref name="Aftermath novel" /> Meanwhile, Coruscant dissolved into a true state of [[Coruscant civil war|civil war]], with some sectors entrenching themselves with Rebel resistance fighters, while other sectors actively fought against their neighbors and supported the Imperial forces. As the Empire fractured all over the galaxy, [[Grand Vizier]] [[Mas Amedda]] took control of Imperial forces on Coruscant<ref name="Life Debt" /> and the [[Coruscanti government]].<ref name="Victory's Price" /> However, the Imperial Navy withdrew support from the [[throneworld]] as [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Gallius Rax]] refused to allow [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]], the figurehead of the Navy, to send reinforcements to the planet. Rax, leader of the [[Shadow Council]] that secretly guided the Empire in its final days, saw the planet as representing the "decay" that caused the Empire's downfall.<ref name="Life Debt" />

In this vacuum, the Imperial Security Bureau was left to coordinate Coruscant's Imperial forces. Grand Vizier Mas Amedda remained the planet's administrator and de-facto head of the Empire, but held no real power. The ISB established a nominal blockade around the planet utilizing ISB spaceships and coordinated the efforts of present security forces and stormtroopers. The Verity and Federal District were heavily fortified with checkpoints and barricades. Coruscant skylanes were diverted, and ISB crafts flew on patrol. Smoke rose from damaged vehicles and buildings as a fierce guerrilla war consumed the entire planet. Amedda, in despair and desperation, sought to turn himself over to New Republic [[Chancellor (New Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]] and [[Princess]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]]. However, they refused to take him prisoner, instead insisting that he find a way to capitulate the Empire and sign a full surrender.<ref name="Life Debt" />

====Galactic Concordance====
{{Quote|Mas Amedda has come out of hiding and wants to sign a cease-fire. He wants to end it. All of it.|Mon Mothma|<ref name="Empire's End" />}}
[[File:GalacticConcordance-BattleOfJakkuLastStand4.png|thumb|left|250px|After the Empire's capitulation, Coruscant's provisional government was established with Amedda as its figurehead.]]
By the time of the [[Battle of Jakku]], Grand Vizier Mas Amedda was kept under house arrest by [[Counselor to the Empire]] Rax at the Imperial Palace. There, he was forced to make [[propaganda]] broadcasts and was treated like a virtual captive. Later, he was rescued by members of a child resistance group known as the [[Anklebiter Brigade]], who had initially come to assassinate him. Amedda managed to persuade the child resistance fighters to help him escape so that he could end the Galactic Civil War. After emerging from hiding, Amedda contacted Chancellor Mothma to surrender. Following the signing of the [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender]] and the [[Galactic Concordance]] on Chandrila, the Empire surrendered to the New Republic<ref name="Empire's End" /> and ceded Coruscant over to the fledgling galactic government<ref name="TFAVisual" /> with Mas Amedda being permitted to form a [[Coruscant's provisional government|provisional government]] on Coruscant, along with Republic observers to ensure that it remained powerless under a figurehead leader. Following the Imperial surrender, weeks of celebrations took place in the streets and rooftops of Coruscant as the population celebrated the end of Imperial rule on the planet.<ref name="Empire's End" />

===New Republic Era===
====A new status====

[[File:New_republic_defense_coruscant_skyscraper.png|thumb|right|250px|While no longer the focal point of legislative power, Coruscant continued to retain operations for governmental functions.]]
With the Galactic Civil War concluded, the New Republic sought to reshape galactic politics in an effort to both prevent the abuses of the Old Republic and bring in disaffected worlds that had seceded from the Republic prior to the Clone Wars. To accomplish this, the restored Galactic Senate decided that all worlds would have an equal say in their government, and as such all worlds had an equal chance of hosting the legislative branch on a rotating basis, rather than simply remaining on Coruscant alone.<ref name="TFAVisual" /> The New Republic would eventually move some government operations back to Coruscant as the planet was already designed to handle and administer the galaxy's infrastructure,<ref name="Rise and Fall">''[[Star Wars: The Rise and Fall of the Galactic Empire]]''</ref> transforming Coruscant into a key administrative hub<ref name="World Building">{{InsiderCite|227|World Building (Star Wars Insider 227)}}</ref> for the young government.<ref name="Chapter 19: The Convert" />

Inoperable [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyers]] were disposed in [[salvage yard]]s such as the [[Shipyard Depot]] on Coruscant.<ref name="Chapter 19: The Convert" /> Some Coruscanti, however, displayed a gleeful disregard for whatever politics shaped the galaxy and happily supported whatever government was in charge, displaying a lack of care for what it entailed beyond Coruscant.<ref name="Insider 228" />

[[File:Amnesty_housing_entrance.png|thumb|left|250px|The New Republic Amnesty Program assigned former Imperials to Coruscant where they could serve the new government.]]
After the Galactic Empire's defeat, captured Imperials were granted the chance to join the New Republic. As a result, programs like the [[Re-Integration Institute]] and the [[New Republic Amnesty Program]] were created to facilitate a former Imperial's assimilation into the new regime. The Amnesty Program consisted of former [[Imperial officer]]s and [[scientist]]s who, after spending time in the Re-Integration Institute, received accommodations in [[Amnesty Housing]] on Coruscant. [[Penn Pershing|Amnesty Scientist L52]] was assigned to work in a [[New Republic Coruscant skyscraper|New Republic skyscraper]] where Imperial technology was archived and destroyed.<ref name="Chapter 19: The Convert" /> [[Elia Kane|Amnesty Officer G68]] worked in the same [[New Republic Coruscant skyscraper (Tuttle's office)|building]] as [[Colonel]] [[Tuttle]] from [[Requisitions]].<ref name="Chapter 21">{{TheMandalorian|Chapter 21: The Pirate}}</ref> L52 was arrested by [[New Republic soldier]]s<ref name="Chapter 19: The Convert" /> im 9 ABY,<ref name="Date 9ABY" /> having left the program's designated perimeter to acquire equipment in the hope of continuing his cloning research, despite its prohibition by the [[Coruscant Accords]].<ref name="Chapter 19: The Convert" />

[[File:New-Republic-skyscraper.png|thumb|right|250px|After joining the New Republic, Coruscant was counted among the Centrist worlds that advocated for a stronger galactic government.]]
Coruscant become part of a political coalition known as the [[Centrists]]. The faction that Coruscant was associated with lobbied for centralized rule akin to the system that defined the Old Empire. Their views were diametrically opposed to that of the [[Populists]] who sought to limit the galactic government's involvement in the affairs of its constituent worlds.<ref name="Bloodline" />

By [[28 ABY]], Coruscant was represented in the New Republic Senate by [[Senior Senator|senior senator]] [[Arbo]] and [[junior senator]] [[Orris Madmund]] at the time of the [[Amaxine warrior crisis]].

Accordingly, the city world was not a symbol of galactic possibilities. Instead, it represented the disturbing realities of the galaxy's current time period.<ref name="GEG" />

The [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]], who was saddened by Coruscant's current state, included the planet in his book titled ''[[Galactic Explorer's Guide]]''.

[[File:CSF_patrol_underworld.png|thumb|right|250px|The inhabitants of Coruscant's lower levels lived in impoverished conditions.]]
Below the housing blocks and surface levels was the population inhabiting the Coruscant underworld. A term used to describe both the thousands of levels underneath the surface, and, Coruscant's criminal population, the underworld was home to millions of the planet's population who were too poor to move upward or were hiding from the attentions of the authorities. The citizens who lived here rarely if ever during their lifetime saw the surface of the planet. Living between vast buildings and infrastructure that supported the surface, they carried on their lives at the mercy of the violence, decay, and constant threat of death.<ref name="To Catch a Jedi" /><ref name="1000 Levels" /><ref name="Lethal Trackdown" /> The [[Kubaz]] [[Glikkin]] hailed from the lower levels and eventually gained enough skill to be recognized as a [[Master Thief]], yet Glikkin vowed to never forget his roots in Coruscant's underworld.<ref name="Hunters">''[[Star Wars: Hunters]]''</ref>

[[File:Galacticsenate.png|thumb|left|250px|Coruscant was the seat of the Galactic Senate, making it home to thousands of senators from across the galaxy.]]
Coruscant, as the center of the galaxy, thrived on the rule of government. It served as the capital of the Republic which kept the peace and prevented a major war in the galaxy for over a thousand years. Under the Republic, the Chancellor and the Senate had a direct influence on the planet's governance. Major events that affected the Republic equally affected Coruscant.<ref name="ZBSB" /><ref name="Lightsaber Lost">{{TCW|Lightsaber Lost}}</ref><ref name="Pursuit of Peace" /><ref name="HoBS" /><ref name="Sabotage" /> In its last years, the Republic's Senate became corrupt, bloated, and ultimately ineffectual, though some continued to fight in the belief of its ability to govern.<ref name="Episode I" /><ref name="Episode II" />

With the formation of the Empire, the Senate transitioned into a limited role, providing council and legislation but ultimately at the power of the Emperor.<ref name="Episode III" /> As Coruscant's government services were strained, the Imperial Senate moved to have each senator open citizen assistance offices that would supplement the work of the local government. While the goal was to primarily assist the members of each senator's homeworld living on Coruscant, the assistance offices were open to help all Coruscanti.<ref name="Thrawn" />

[[File:EmperorsThroneRoom-2020DarthVader1.png|thumb|right|250px|After the Republic fell, Coruscant retained its status as the seat of galactic power under the Emperor's reign.]]
At the height of his power, Palpatine disbanded the Senate altogether and gave what little power they had left to the regional [[governor]]s.<ref name="Episode IV">{{Film|IV}}</ref> At the end of the Galactic Civil War, the New Republic installed a provisional government over Coruscant led by the former Imperial Grand Vizier Mas Amedda.<ref name="Empire's End" /> However, the New Republic did not establish its government on Coruscant, choosing instead to rotate the capital among the various member worlds.<ref name="TFAVisual" /> Under the New Republic, Coruscant was represented by a senator and junior senator,<ref name="Bloodline" /> but the planet had come under the control of crime syndicates.<ref name="GEG" />

Epidemic outbreaks at the starports of Coruscant were controlled by the [[Coruscant Health Office]].<ref name="Coruscant Altaya" /> Coruscant was policed by the Coruscant Security Force, which utilized police droids on the upper levels together with sentient officers and detectives,<ref name="Senate Murders">{{TCW|Senate Murders}}</ref> and the burly underworld police who patrolled in the cutthroat environment of the lower levels.<ref name="To Catch a Jedi" /> The [[Coruscant Ministry of Ingress]] handled the flow of immigration to and from the planet,<ref name="SWCL" /> and the [[Galactic Republic Customs of Coruscant]] office monitored cargo transports.<ref name="Lethal Trackdown" />

[[File:Senate_Commandos_Hostage_Crisis.png|thumb|left|250px|The Senate Guards were stationed on Coruscant due to their role in government security.]]
The Senate had its own protectors, the Senate Guard.

==Locations==
===The upper city===
====CoCo Town====
{{Main|CoCo Town}}
{{Quote|They care. We did more than that. We passed messages. Told them about troop movements. We gave them intel, Iggs. How else do you think the rebels retook Coco-Town? That was us.|[[Streaks]], to [[Iggs]]|<ref name="Aftermath novel" />}}
[[File:CoCo_Town.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of Coruscant's many sectors was a dilapidated industrial area known as CoCo Town.]]
[[CoCo Town]] was a dilapidated industrial area of Coruscant. Home to mostly hard-working laborers, CoCo Town was located on a surface area of the city.<ref name="DexsDiner" /> The area, however, was not as run down as other heavy industrial surface districts and contained relatively well-maintained streets, speeder lanes, and a shuttle bus route.<ref name="Episode II" /> On one of the main streets built on top of the urban blocks was an eatery called Dex's Diner. Owned and operated by Dexter Jettster, a [[Besalisk]] with a colorful background, it served mostly hard workers from the area. The diner offered home-style cooked meals and freshly brewed [[ardees]]. Jettster worked as the cook and employed two waitresses, [[Hermione Bagwa]] and her [[droid]] partner, [[WA-7 waitress droid|WA-7]].<ref name="DexsDiner" /> Shortly before the Clone Wars, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi came to Dex's Diner to see if his old friend Jettster could identify a poisoned dart. Jettster identified it as originating from the planet Kamino, which he knew of from his days as a prospector.<ref name="Episode II" />

During the civil war that erupted after the Emperor's death, CoCo Town became an epicenter of the fight between rebel and Imperial forces. The fighting saw the formation of the so-called Anklebiter Brigade, a group of youths familiar with the underground maintenance systems, who would use them to sneak behind Imperial lines and disrupt their abilities to fight.<ref name="Aftermath novel" />

====COMPNOR arcology====
{{Main|COMPNOR arcology}}
[[File:Isb-hq_wide.png|thumb|left|250px|The ISB Central Office towered over the COMPNOR complex.]]
The COMPNOR arcology was a huge, labyrinthine building in the Imperial City's Federal District<ref name="PressPin">{{Rebelscum|url=story/front/Rebels_Imperial_Press_Corps_Pin_160036.asp|text=Rebels Imperial Press Corps Pin}}</ref>, housing several Imperial government agencies including the [[Commission for the Preservation of the New Order]] and the [[Ubiqtorate]].<ref name="Tarkin" /> High-ranking officers such as [[Minister of Information]] [[Pollux Hax]] maintained offices in the complex,<ref name="PressPin" /> while the [[Imperial Security Bureau]]'s [[ISB Central Office|Central Office]] was directly connected with it. The importance of the complex led to it being considered one of the three points of the District's "supreme triangle", alongside the Imperial Palace and Navy Intelligence Headquarters.<ref name="Tarkin" />

====Grand Republic Medical Facility====
{{Main|Grand Republic Medical Facility}}
{{Quote|The Grand Medical Facility is state-of-the-art.|Nala-Se|<ref name="Conspiracy" />}}
[[File:GrandMedicalFacility.png|thumb|right|250px|The Grand Republic Medical Facility was a Republic Military treatment center, yet also a secret lair of the Sith.]]
The Grand Republic Medical Facility was a tower built to serve as a treatment center for badly injured Republic soldiers. The building was heavily guarded and had defensive shields, an independent power supply and was armored to where it could withstand a siege. The facility provided treatment to patients from all over the galaxy and boasted cutting-edge techniques in surgery and biomechanical reconstruction. The heavy fortifications and benign front appealed to Palpatine, and towards the end of the Clone Wars, he began using the lower levels of the facility to store Sith artifacts and as a meditation area, access to which was prevented by the Red Guards.<ref name="SWCL" />

Jedi General [[Shaak Ti]] and [[Doctor]] [[Nala Se]] escorted the [[Advanced Recon Commando]] [[Fives|CT-5555]] "Fives" to the Grand Republic Medical Facility as part of their investigation into the actions of [[Tup|CT-5385]],<ref name="Orders">{{TCW|Orders (episode)}}</ref> the clone trooper who prematurely executed Order 66.<ref name="The Unknown">{{TCW|The Unknown}}</ref> Chancellor Palpatine confronted Fives in the facility, revealing his true nature. Fives fought back against the Red Guards and escaped the facility, though he was eventually located and killed by the Coruscant Guard.<ref name="Orders">{{TCW|Orders (episode)}}</ref> After ending Fives' threat to Palpatine's plans, the Medical Facility was temporarily closed, and Palpatine used the opportunity to move several larger secret [[Sith artifact]]s into the tower from a building in the Works. However, the medical capabilities remained operational and were used to build the life-sustaining suit for Darth Vader after his fateful duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi. The Sith artifacts inside the building fueled Vader's recovery and hate.<ref name="SWCL" />

====Imperial Executive Building====
{{Main|Imperial Executive Building}}
{{Quote|The Chancellor has been moved to his Senate quarters, and the perimeter has been secured.|Mace Windu|<ref name="Orders" />}}
[[File:RepublicExecutiveBuilding.png|thumb|left|250px|The Chancellor's office was located in the Senate Office Building on Coruscant.]]
Directly adjacent to the Senate Building was the Senate Office Building. The executive building had docking bays that wrapped around the building, allowing Senators to land their private shuttles and walk inside. The building contained mostly offices and meeting rooms for members of the Senate but also held the offices used on a day-to-day basis by the Supreme Chancellor. During Palpatine's term, the Chancellor's office was decorated with red floors and walls as well as several statues. A lobby led to the Chancellor's public office, which contained a grand desk and large window that overlooked the cityscape. To the side, another hallway led to Palpatine's inner private office.<ref name="Episode III" /> The Senate Office Building became known as the Imperial Executive Building after the Republic's reorganization into the Galactic Empire.<ref name="Dark Lord 12">[[Darth Vader (2017) 12|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 12]]</ref>

====Imperial Inspectorate HQ====
{{Main|Imperial Inspectorate HQ}}
{{Quote|This is a secure facility. We do not have just anyone running about.|Wilhuff Tarkin, to Ahsoka Tano|<ref name="TJWKTM" />}}
[[File:RCMO-ToC-CotR.png|thumb|right|250px|The Imperial Inspectorate HQ was originally the Republic Center for Military Operations.]]
The Imperial Inspectorate HQ served as the [[Imperial Military]] headquarters of the [[Inspectorate]]<ref name="Aphra 15">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 15|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 15]]</ref> as well as the [[Naval Intelligence Agency]] during the Empire's reign.<ref name="Tarkin" /> The facility was originally a Republic military base; constructed in close proximity to the staging areas for [[Star Destroyer]]s, the Republic Center for Military Operations was designed by [[Orson Callan Krennic]].<ref name="Catalyst" /> Outside of the complex was an airfield with [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|''Venator''-class Star Destroyers]], [[HAVw A6 Juggernaut]]s, and other ships. The [[First Battle Memorial]] was located in front of the base's main entrance.<ref name="TJWKTM" />

The base was protected by shock troopers of the Coruscant Guard. Inside was a military prison, the cells had two options for entering. The first was sliding a keycard. The second was pressing a button on the outside of each cell. The cells had ray-shielded doors to make sure prisoners did not escape. Inside each cell was a bed and bowls for water and food. Another area in the prison was a medium circular room with a fairly large computer for scanning people before they entered the base, a crate for weapons and communication devices, and a red button to start the red-alert sequence.<ref name="TJWKTM" />

In the latter half of the war, the prison held [[Whorm Loathsom]], [[Poggle the Lesser]], and [[Wat Tambor]]. It was also here that Ahsoka Tano escaped when she was suspected of killing Letta Turmond.<ref name="TJWKTM" /> Additionally, inside the compound was a military tribunal courtroom, in which the court decided the fate of dangerous criminals. It was a tall room, with platforms extending into its center for the accused, prosecution, and defense. There was seating along its walls for the presiding official, jury, and other trial participants and onlookers.<ref name="TCWwrongjedi" />

====Imperial Palace====
{{Main|Imperial Palace}}
{{Quote|The most famous of the Jedi temples, located on Coruscant, served as the home of the Jedi High Council and the vast library of data known as the Jedi Archives.

[[File:JediTemple_cloudysky.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Jedi Temple was part school, part monastery, and the home of the Jedi Order on Coruscant.]]
As the galactic capital, Coruscant was also home to the Jedi Order, guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy. An order of Force-sensitives, the Jedi Knights served the Republic for thousands of years as keepers of the peace. Their home was the Jedi Temple. Built on a plain of low lying urban blocks, the Jedi Temple was easily recognizable on the Coruscant cityscape with its distinctive five spires. Part school and part monastery, the Temple was the hub of all Jedi activity throughout the galaxy.<ref name="JediTemple">{{Databank|jedi-temple|Jedi Temple}}</ref> In one of the spires sat the Jedi High Council, led by the Grand Master of the Order, which directed the actions of the Jedi and served as advisers to the Senate and Chancellor.<ref name="Yoda">{{Databank|yoda|Yoda}}</ref>

The Temple held a large lobby and chambers with statues of famous Jedi<ref name="Episode II" /> and also contained numerous facilities including hanger bays for starships and speeders utilized by the Jedi,<ref name="Episode III">{{Film|III}}</ref> sleeping and living quarters, rooms for meetings and instruction,<ref name="Episode II" /> a medical facility,<ref name="Deception">{{TCW|Deception}}</ref> prison cells,<ref name="Sabotage" /> and communications and security stations.<ref name="Episode III" /> The Temple also held the famous [[Jedi Archives]], which stored the largest collection of information on the galaxy<ref name="Episode II" /> as well as a vault containing the valuable [[holocron]]s containing the Order's Force knowledge and secrets.<ref name="Holocron" />

[[File:FlamingTemple.png|thumb|right|250px|The Jedi Temple fell in the first hours of Order 66, the directive that initiated the Great Jedi Purge.]]
During the Clone Wars, the Jedi, serving as generals and commanders of the Grand Army, coordinated their efforts from the Temple. However, as the war began to conclude, the Jedi became more separated from the hierarchy of the military command and establishment.<ref name="Sabotage" /><ref name="To Catch a Jedi" /> When Palpatine was revealed as the Sith Lord the Jedi had been searching for, he ordered the execution of Order 66 and sent his new apprentice Darth Vader to the Jedi Temple. Entering with the 501st Legion, Vader and the clone troopers seized the Temple, killing all the Jedi and younglings inside and setting the monastery ablaze. Later, Masters Yoda and Kenobi infiltrated the Temple to discover what had occurred. It was there they reconfigured a distress signal transmitting from the Temple to any surviving Jedi asking them to return (into a Sith trap), and learned the truth of Skywalker's fall and Palpatine's identity as the Dark Lord of the Sith.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:Imperial_Temple.jpg|thumb|left|250px|After the Clone Wars, the Emperor had the Jedi Temple converted into the Imperial Palace.]]
After the war, Palpatine turned the Temple into the Imperial Palace, using it as his new home. The Temple's spires remained intact though the rest of the Temple was heavily remodeled and expanded. The hallways were stripped of all statues and Republic-era ornaments. Where they had once been quiet and solemn, they became filled with busy government workers and functionaries. A large landing courtyard allowed for shuttles and starships to land. The entire Palace complex was watched over by the red-robed Imperial Royal Guard. The center spire was converted into the Emperor's throne room with a ten-meter tall podium in the center accessible by the Emperor from his residence via a private turbolift.<ref name="Tarkin" /> The structure remained standing on Coruscant throughout the Emperor's reign.<ref name="RotJ" />

====Imperial Senate Building====
{{Main|Galactic Senate Building}}
{{Quote|There is no civility, only politics. The Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates. There is no interest in the common good.|Sheev Palpatine, to Padmé Amidala|<ref name="Episode I" />}}
[[File:Galactic_Senate_RotS.png|thumb|right|250px|The Galactic Senate Building was the political heart of the galaxy during the age of the Galactic Republic.]]
The Senate Building was located within the heart of the dense Federal District. Delegates would meet here during sessions of congress to discuss legislation and galactic policy. The structure's recognizable dome was two kilometers in diameter; the [[Galactic Senate Chamber]] could seat over a thousand senators.<ref name="SWCL" /> Each senatorial delegation had their own hover platform, which they could detach from the walls of the chamber. They could then float it throughout the cavernous hall to be recognized by the Senate chair or to debate the issue at hand. In the center of the Senate chamber was the Chancellor's podium. Seated in it would be the Supreme Chancellor and the Senate's Vice Chair, who would lead sessions of congress.<ref name="Episode I" /> The podium could be lowered to an office used by the Chancellor below the chamber.<ref name="Episode III" />

===The lower levels===
====Coruscant Underworld====
{{Main|Coruscant Underworld}}
{{Quote|What about Coruscant? Is there unrest here?''"<br />"''You must be joking. Go down two thousand levels and you'll find all the unrest you could ever want. Go down four thousand and you might as well be in Wild Space.|[[Mitth'raw'nuruodo]] and [[Wullf Yularen]]|<ref name="Thrawn">[[Thrawn (novel)|''Thrawn'']]</ref>}}
[[File:CoruscantUnderworldPortal-TWJ.png|thumb|left|250px|An underworld of crime, poverty, and darkness existed beneath the upper levels of Coruscant.]]
Beneath the top-level structures, streets and glistening lights of the city surface was Coruscant's underworld. Its underworld was known for its crime and smugglers. It was accessible by huge portals that additionally served as ventilation shafts. The underworld was a massive city beneath a city with hundreds of [[:Category:Coruscant levels|levels]] built on top of each other. On each level, dwellings and smaller buildings were squeezed in between massive towers and infrastructure that serviced the upper levels. The streets and alleyways were narrow and large sections contained massive buildings and warehouses, largely abandoned. Sunlight almost never reached the lower levels, which had to be artificially lit.<ref name="To Catch a Jedi" />

The population was able to move from one area to another via [[Coruscant elevated maglev train|trains]] that ran below and above the planet's surface. While airspeeders were used, they were a less common sight than on the surface levels. The underworld, containing a vast population of the poor and criminal, was dark and violent. Those who wanted to disappear to hide from the authorities or to conduct illegal transactions could blend in despite the presence of cam droids and other monitoring technology.<ref name="To Catch a Jedi" /> Patrolled by the underworld police division of the Coruscant Security Force, the underworld was where large populations of species not loyal to the Emperor were relocated to after the formation of the Empire. Uprisings and riots became common, with stormtroopers frequently called in to assist the Coruscant cops in putting down any dissent. 

====Level 2046====
{{Main|Level 2046}}
[[File:Level2046-JediSurvivor.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Level 2046 was one of thousands of levels that made up the ecumenopolis of Coruscant.]]
Level 2046 was a middle level in the city. Home to a thriving community of sellers and industrialists, the sector housed dozens of shops and even a meat packing plant. Yet, there was also many impoverished citizens and desperate people who lived on this level. By the Imperial Era, the economy of the area had started to decline, even with the Empire's ruthless crackdown on crime. The increased oppression and protection racketeering from troopers hurt many of the businesses there, and corrupt politicians, such as Senator Daho Sejan, would use the level as a way of increasing the financial power. This level also featured at least one [[Desi's Noodles]], a common food chain of popular fast food stores that were located in the Coruscant Underworld. Eating there was considered a must for travelers to the planet. Many stormtroopers frequented the locations for their famous dishes.<ref name="JS" />

===Uscru District===
====Upper district====
{{Main|Uscru District}}
[[File:GalaxiesOperaHouse.png|thumb|right|250px|The Galaxies Opera House was located in the upper levels of the Uscru District.]]
Coruscant's entertainment districts catered to everyone from the wealthy and powerful to the secretive and criminal. The upper sections of the Uscru District reached to upper levels of the city where the [[Galaxies Opera House]] was located. It was here that Chancellor Palpatine often would come to enjoy various performances. He also met Anakin Skywalker and told him the story of [[Darth Plagueis]] to subvert Skywalker's faith in the Jedi.<ref name="galaxyopera">{{Databank|galaxies-opera-house|Galaxies Opera House}}</ref>

{{Quote|Where are you going, Master?''"<br />"''For a drink.|Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi|<ref name="Episode II" />}}
[[File:Vos_Gesal_Street.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Uscru District was defined by a combination of bars, casinos, clubs, and other entertainment-based establishments.]]
Further down in the lower levels of the Uscru Entertainment District was a variety of establishments, most notably the [[Outlander Club]]. The club was situated in a less developed area of the district and did not garner as much attention from the police, a fact that worked in the club's favor. Its labyrinth of bars, gambling rooms and sleeping quarters allowed for a wide variety of visitors and entertainment. In the center was a large bar, usually crowded, that catered to all parts of Coruscant's society.<ref name="SWCL" /> Jedi Knights Kenobi and Skywalker pursued bounty hunter [[Zam Wesell]] into the Uscru District after her attempted assassination of Senator Amidala. The pursuit ended in the Outlander Club, where the Jedi located the assassin. However, Wesell was killed by bounty hunter Jango Fett in an alley outside the club before the Jedi could finish questioning her.<ref name="Episode II" />

===The Works===

[[File:The_Works_2.png|thumb|right|250px|Coruscant's industrial zone, known as The Works, was once a manufacturing powerhouse known throughout the galaxy.]]
A large sector and industrial area, [[The Works]] was once a great manufacturing district, recognized as a major source of production for [[Starship|spacecraft]] parts, [[construction droid]]s, and building materials. However, centuries prior to the Clone Wars, increasingly high cost on Coruscant prompted most manufacturers to shift their operations to off-planet facilities. Afterwards, the Works mainly consisted of long-abandoned buildings and empty warehouses, many of which were appropriated by criminals, with large areas rendered uninhabitable by toxic waste. Because of this, a derelict hangar in the neglected industrial zone was the site of clandestine meetings between Darth Sidious and Darth Tyranus during the Clone Wars.<ref name="UltimateSW" />

==Behind the scenes==
In the [[Star Wars: Episode VI Revenge of the Jedi|Rough Draft]] and Revised Rough Draft of the script for [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']], the Imperial capital planet was set to appear under the name [[Had Abbadon system|Had Abbadon]].<ref name="Making of">''[[The Making of Return of the Jedi]]''</ref> During the development of [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']], [[George Lucas]] officially adopted the name Coruscant for the planet, a name that was created by [[Timothy Zahn]] for his [[June]] [[1991]] [[Star Wars Legends|Legends]] novel ''[[Heir to the Empire]]''. The planet first appeared in the [[1994]] [[Star Wars: TIE Fighter (video game)|Star Wars: Tie Fighter (video game)]], which showed scenes on Coruscant of the [[Imperial Palace/Legends|Imperial Palace]], with its name first mentioned in ''The Phantom Menace''. The [[prequel trilogy]] and the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]] and [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars|television series]] showed Coruscant as a major center of activity and action. In ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]'' the planet is briefly revisited via the dreams of [[Jyn Erso]], featuring her childhood on Coruscant with her father, [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso]] and [[Orson Callan Krennic|Orson Krennic]]. Coruscant was a location in early versions of ''Star Wars'': Episode IX&mdash;both in [[Colin Trevorrow]]'s ''Duel of the Fates'' script and in the early concept stages for what became [[Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker|''The Rise of Skywalker'']]; For the latter, it eventually evolved into [[Exegol]].<ref name="Art of TROS">''[[The Art of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]''</ref>

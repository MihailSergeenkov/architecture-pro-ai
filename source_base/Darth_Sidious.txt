Born on the [[Mid Rim Territories|Mid Rim]] [[planet]] Naboo in [[84 BBY]] as the [[High Republic Era]] ended, Sidious possessed a strong connection to [[the Force]], and was secretly trained in the ways of the [[Sith]] by [[Darth Plagueis]]. He eventually betrayed and killed his [[Sith Master]], in order to train his own [[Sith apprentice]], [[Darth]] [[Maul]], for the [[Rule of Two]] limited their ranks to two Sith [[Lord]]s at any given [[time]]. As a result of the [[Invasion of Naboo]], a crisis orchestrated by Sidious, the Senate [[Supreme Chancellor election, 32 BBY|elected]] Palpatine as [[Supreme Chancellor]]. The [[Separatist Crisis]] and the Clone Wars were masterminded by Sidious and his new apprentice, [[Dooku|Darth Tyranus]], in an effort to achieve [[Galaxy|galactic]] dominance. Following an attempt to [[Duel in Palpatine's office|arrest the chancellor]], the [[Great Jedi Purge]] commenced with Sidious enacting [[Order 66]].

With the [[Jedi]] all but extinct, Sidious installed the [[New Order]] in the Republic's [[Republic Era|place]], declaring himself Galactic [[Emperor]] and bringing an end to the [[Millennium|millennia]] of [[democracy]]. Shortly after betraying and causing the death of Tyranus, he took on a new apprentice, having lured the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] to the dark side and transforming him into Darth Vader. Their reign was virtually unchallenged for a generation until the formation of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. During the [[Galactic Civil War]], the Emperor sought to betray Vader, by replacing him with the latter's son, [[Luke Skywalker]]. However, Sidious' plan backfired when Vader ultimately renounced the dark side and killed Sidious to protect Luke. Thus, with the Sith's destruction, the Force was brought back into balance, fulfilling Anakin's [[destiny]] as the prophesied [[Chosen One]].

Through his master's teachings, however, Sidious transferred his essence to an imperfect [[Cloning|clone]] vessel that had been [[Clone template|modeled]] on his original body. Anticipating the possibility of defeat, he created the [[Contingency]] to [[Battle of Jakku|destroy]] the Galactic Empire and replace it with a new [[Sith Empire]], in the event of such a setback. His plans culminated in the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destruction]] of the [[New Republic]] and the [[First Order-Resistance War|emergence]] of the [[First Order]], the creation of [[Supreme Leader]] [[Snoke]], who turned [[Ben Solo]]&mdash;heir to the [[Skywalker family|Skywalker bloodline]]&mdash;to the dark side, and the establishment of the [[Final Order]]. When the Emperor [[Exegol Broadcast|announced]] his return to the galaxy in [[35 ABY]], the [[Resistance]] invaded the planet [[Exegol]], Sidious' [[Sith Citadel|hidden stronghold]] in the [[Unknown Regions]]. During the battle, the resurrected Emperor discovered a [[Force dyad|dyad in the Force]] in the form of the [[Force-bond|bond]] between Solo and Rey, a [[Padawan]] sired from the [[Palpatine family|Palpatine bloodline]]. His lifelong dream of eternal rule was finally quashed when Rey called upon the strength of past Jedi to vanquish her grandfather by turning his own [[Force lightning|power]] against him, destroying Sidious and his [[Sith Eternal]] [[Sith cultist|cultists]].

===Early life and apprenticeship===

[[File:DarthSidious-SWE.png|thumb|left|250px|Sheev Palpatine was secretly trained as a Sith Lord, taking the name of Darth Sidious.]]
The origins of [[Darth]] Sidious were closely guarded secrets that he took to his [[Burial|grave]] more than once. He was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[Mid Rim Territories|Mid Rim]] [[planet]] [[Naboo]] as Sheev Palpatine,<ref name="TSWB" /> [[84 BBY|eighty-four]] [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]].<ref name="Timelines" /> The dynastic,<ref name="A Family at War" /> [[noble]] [[Palpatine family]] belonged to the affluent class in [[Naboo (people)|Naboo society]],<ref name="TSWB" /> although throughout [[Republic Era|several]] [[Imperial Era|points]] of [[time]] of his life, Palpatine did not have any living family members as far as the public was aware,<ref name="RiseFall">''[[Star Wars: The Rise and Fall of the Galactic Empire]]''</ref><ref name="Aftermath: Life Debt" /> and no records of obituaries for his parents existed,<ref name="RiseFall" /> marking him as the last of his ancient family bloodline.<ref name="Odyssey">''[[The Odyssey of Star Wars: An Epic Poem]]''</ref> Palpatine was raised in the cultured [[city]] of [[Theed]], his [[homeworld]]'s [[capital]]; he formed connections with a reputable host of credible [[Politics|politicians]] produced over the [[Standard century|centuries]], all the while acquiring a great amount of knowledge on governance and the subtleties of power during his youth.<ref name="CL2016">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref> As such, Palpatine had been skilled in manipulation since boyhood.<ref name="Queen's Hope">''[[Queen's Hope]]''</ref>

The details about how Sidious came to study under the [[Sith]] were known by very few,<ref name="BioGal1" /> with it not even being known of when he did,<ref name="TSWB" /> but he became the [[Sith apprentice]] to<ref name="Tarkin" /> [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Darth Plagueis]] and took on the name Darth Sidious. As a [[Sith Lord]], Sidious learned all his [[Sith Master]] knew about the [[dark side of the Force]],<ref name="Episode III" /> following the tradition first set by the ancient [[Darth Bane]].<ref name="Geektionary">''[[Star Wars: Geektionary: The Galaxy from A - Z]]''</ref> While apprenticed to Plagueis, Sidious constructed his own [[Darth Sidious' lightsabers|Sith lightsabers]].<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> At the same time, little by little, he began to secure political power.<ref name="Saga of Rey">{{EncyclopediaCite|The Saga of Rey}}</ref>

As a young man, Palpatine had traveled throughout [[the galaxy]], collecting art, at least some of which was connected to the dark side, while doing so. Unaware docents would have written off his collection as junk, but Palpatine knew better.<ref name="Queen's Peril">''[[Queen's Peril]]''</ref> He learned new tactics for how to spread his power during his travels that he kept secret for years to come.<ref name="Queen's Hope" /> While training with Plagueis, Sidious was taught that two Sith were required for their perilous machinations. So, if they worked together in accordance to Darth Bane's [[Rule of Two]], with one of them serving as bait for the dark side of the Force and the other as a vessel, they would succeed in acquiring the ability to harness the full power of the dark side and rule [[Immortality|immortal]] for ten thousand years.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Darth Sidious and Darth Plagueis worked together for years, trying to unlock the secrets to immortality, which was the obsession and longtime lust of Plagueis.<ref name="Tarkin" /> Sidious was eventually made aware of Plagueis' ability to manipulate the [[midi-chlorian]]s to create life, which his master employed to prevent the people he cared for from [[Death|dying]].<ref name="Episode III" /> Plagueis believed the secret to immortality laid within science, and so conducted "unnatural" experiments with his rare ability to manipulate the midi-chlorians, as part of the pair's in depth studies into the biological underpinnings of life itself. Though they were incomplete, they were encouraging to Sidious.<ref name="TSWB" /> According to Darth Sidious' [[book]], ''[[The Secrets of the Sith]]'', written later on his life, Plagueis discovered a form of "immortality" through [[transference]], a [[Force power]] that allowed the user to transfer their spirit and consciousness to another body, essentially using bodies as vessels.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /><ref name="Secrets of the Sith">''[[Star Wars: The Secrets of the Sith]]''</ref> This obsession with extending one's own life later passed onto Sidious<ref name="Episode IX" /> from his time as<ref name="TROS VD">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> [[Galactic Emperor]].<ref name="SWEYoda">{{SWE|characters|yoda|Yoda}}</ref> Plagueis also attempted to create a [[Force dyad]] with Sidious, a unique [[Force-bond]] as strong as life itself and which was predecessor to the Rule of Two. However, Plagueis was unable to form the dyad.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" />

===Political career and double life===
====Senator of Naboo====
{{Quote|As a dark apprentice, I sensed that the Galactic Republic was in disarray. Its delegates held no interest in the common good. They would be easy targets for my influence. Serving as a senator, I manipulated their greed in my favor. With each new act of legislation, I rose through their ranks. Total control of the galaxy's governing body drew ever closer.|Darth Sidious|<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" />}}
[[File:Rise-of-Palpatine.png|thumb|right|250px|Senator Palpatine represented his homeworld Naboo in the Galactic Senate while keeping his Sith identity a secret.]]
In his public persona as Sheev Palpatine, Sidious took a great interest in politics and the public life of Naboo.<ref name="Complete">[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|''Star Wars: Complete Locations'']]</ref> In [[65 BBY]]<ref name="Nexus">''[[Nexus of Power]]''</ref> he was part of the officials attending the opening ceremony of the [[Theed power generator]], with attendees noting his interest in the complex's deep-pit design.<ref name="Complete" /> His embarkment on a career in politics was further aided by his master, who arranged for him to be raised<ref name="Saga of Rey" /> to the position of [[senator]] for his homeworld in the [[Galactic Republic]] [[Galactic Senate|Senate]]<ref name="Tarkin" /> as part of the [[Naboo delegation]],<ref name="Queen's Peril" /> being elected in [[52 BBY]].<ref name="Timelines" /> His role also made him the senator for the rest of the [[Chommell sector]],<ref name="Queen's Peril" /> meaning he represented a total of thirty-six planets.<ref name="TPM Graphic Novel">[[Star Wars: The Phantom Menace Graphic Novel Adaptation|''Star Wars: The Phantom Menace'' Graphic Novel Adaptation]]</ref> Once elected, Palpatine quickly joined incumbent [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Skor Kalpana]]'s ruling party. He was followed by a grouping of aides who loyally followed him since his days on Naboo. He noticed the fervent bickering and corruption that mired the Republic. He began to establish relations with those who would become his future collaborators, such as [[Wilhuff Tarkin]]. The duo met for the first time when Tarkin was still a cadet of the [[Sullust Sector Spacefarers Academy]], and while Palpatine was still apprenticed to Plagueis.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Taking an interest in the younger man, Senator Palpatine resolved to help him to join the [[Judicial Department]], according to Tarkin's desire but advised him to also consider a political career. In the following years, their relationship became more and more confidential. Palpatine often lauded Tarkin for his talents and skills and remarked they were very similar: they both came from planets at the edge of the galaxy but were destined to have great repercussions on the [[Timeline of galactic history|history of the galaxy]] itself. Tarkin eventually became one of the few people who called Palpatine by his first name.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Keeping his Sith identity a secret from the public eye, Sidious took it upon himself to execute the [[Grand Plan|Sith's long-percolating plan]] of supplanting the Republic with a new [[Galactic Empire|Sith Empire]], as well as destroying the [[Jedi Order]]. In the process, he would deceive the Senate, Republic and Jedi.<ref name="SWESidious">{{SWE|characters|darthsidious|Darth Sidious}}</ref> In his days as a senator, Palpatine was known to have the backing of mysterious friends and allies who he might reference but never name; for example, even Tarkin did not know who specifically worked with Palpatine in the shadows, even if Palpatine often referenced them. Trying to speculate as to who his secret supporters were, Palpatine's political enemies knew he had secret contacts aside from his loyal Naboo followers and the senatorial cabal he was often grouped within. Rumors swirled that shadowy organizations and figures who worked out of the public eye&mdash;including industrialists, financiers and bankers from the galaxy's most major sectors&mdash;were linked to the senator of Naboo.<ref name="Tarkin" />

====Training a Sith apprentice====
{{Quote|For many years, Darth Maul trained in secrecy. But as my plans for galactic dominance began to unfold, the time came to make his presence known.|Darth Sidious|<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" />}}
Seeking a Sith apprentice, Sidious traveled to the planet [[Dathomir]] and met with the [[Dathomirian]] [[Nightsisters|Nightsister]] [[Mother (title)|Mother]] [[Talzin]]. Intermingling his knowledge of the dark side of the Force with Talzin's knowledge of Nightsister [[magick]]s, Sidious had considered to make Talzin his apprentice and right hand. However, Sidious chose her infant son, the [[Zabrak]] [[Nightbrothers|Nightbrother]] who would become his true Sith apprentice, [[Maul|Darth Maul]].<ref name="SonOfDathomir3">[[Darth Maul — Son of Dathomir 3|''Darth Maul — Son of Dathomir'' 3]]</ref> When Sidious visited Talzin, Maul always hid in his room, afraid of the man and worried about Talzin's increasing bond with him.<ref name="UnwillingApprentice">{{StoryCite|story=An Unwilling Apprentice|book=Myths & Fables}} {{C|[[Galaxy's Edge]] edition}}</ref> Sidious was drawn to Maul for his inability to control his anger.<ref name="Queen's Peril" /> Eventually, Sidious ordered Talzin to give up Maul to a [[Unidentified Nightbrother keeper|keeper]], threatening to not follow through on his promise to make her his apprentice. She reluctantly agreed, and Maul ran into the forest angrily, overhearing the conversation from behind his door. When he returned the next morning, a Nightbrother took him and threw him in a pit, not allowing him to say goodbye to his own mother.<ref name="UnwillingApprentice" />

[[File:Sidious_Maul.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious killed his Sith Master Darth Plagueis, and under the Rule of Two, trained Darth Maul as his Sith apprentice.]]
Over the course of months, Maul was put through relentless domestic abuse, all orchestrated by Sidious as a test. With the influence of his keeper's sons beating him and the abuse, Sidious' wish for Maul came true; Maul's perceptions, and his love for his mother eventually turned into resentment and hatred for abandoning him. Maul's hatred started manifesting through the Dark Side, and he would practice using the dark side of the Force every chance he got; eventually, the two brothers stopped beating him after seeing that their provocations were no longer affecting him. Sidious eventually orchestrated a selection to gain himself an apprentice. At the Selection Arena, Sidious witnessed Maul after he was initially prevented from participating. In a sudden burst of anger, he used the dark side of the Force to [[Force choke]] the two brothers, and then the keeper, all in front of Sidious and Talzin. Beyond pleased at Maul's progress and potential, Sidious declared Maul the winner and his new apprentice, much to Talzin's dismay.<ref name="UnwillingApprentice" />

As such, instead of following through on his promise of giving the apprenticeship to Talzin, Sidious stole her son from her and left Dathomir, leaving the Nightsister longing for revenge against the Sith Lord.<ref name="SonOfDathomir3" /> Following the traditions set forth by the Rule of Two<ref name="TSWB" /> as it demanded only two Sith,<ref name="Sacrifice">{{TCW|Sacrifice (episode)}}</ref> and deciding that Plagueis had outlived his usefulness, Sidious betrayed his master by breaking into his [[Darth Plagueis' apartment|apartment]] and murdering him in his [[sleep]].<ref name="Emperor Palpatine">{{EncyclopediaCite|Emperor Palpatine}}</ref> Sidious remembered with fondness the moment he realized he was more powerful than Plagueis and could kill the man who had trained him. He later reflected that "Master" was the first title of power he claimed for himself.<ref name="Masters short story">{{StoryCite|story=Masters|book=Stories of Jedi and Sith}}</ref> Now the Sith Master himself, Sidious brutally trained Maul to be a weapon of the Sith,<ref name="SonOfDathomir3" /> viewing Maul's prowess and combat abilities as an invaluable asset to his Grand Plan.<ref name="SWEMaul">{{SWE|characters|darthmaul|Darth Maul}}</ref>

At some point while training Maul, Sidious took his apprentice to [[Malachor]] to bear witness to a [[Great Scourge of Malachor|great battle]] that occurred there between the Jedi and the Sith. He forced Maul to breathe in the ashes of [[Sith warrior]]s, slain when an ancient weapon was activated in the [[Malachor Sith Temple|Sith temple]] on the planet. While breathing in this ash, Maul had visions of members of the Sith order being struck down by the Jedi. He felt the slash of saber after saber as he felt the death of his Sith brethren.<ref name="Darth Maul 2">[[Darth Maul (2017) 2|''Darth Maul'' (2017) 2]]</ref> These visions, in tandem with his training, made Maul long for revenge against the Jedi Order,<ref name="SWEMaul" /> which had defeated the Sith a millennium earlier.<ref name="DBBane">{{Databank|darth-bane|Darth Bane}}</ref> Thus motivated, Darth Maul would serve as a powerful weapon in Sidious' plans to destroy the Jedi and restore the Sith to galactic power.<ref name="SWEMaul" />

====Preparations and manipulation====
{{Quote|Because something dangerous is brewing in our little corner of the Outer Rim. Discontent is on the rise, as are criminal enterprises and mercenary groups in the employ of self-serving corporations. In the Seswenna sector, several lommite mining concerns are vying for the attention of the Trade Federation, which is determined to forge a monopoly in the free trade zones. Even on my own Naboo, the king finds himself embroiled with the Trade Federation and off world bankers with regard to our plasma exports. Ours are remote worlds, but what transpires in those sectors of the Outer Rim could very well have galactic repercussions.|Senator Sheev Palpatine, to Governor-to-be Wilhuff Tarkin|<ref name="Tarkin" />}}
[[File:Senator_palpatine.png|thumb|right|250px|Darth Sidious lived a double life as Sheev Palpatine, using both identities to further his plans of galactic domination.]]
In [[42 BBY]],<ref name="Dooku leaving date">''[[The Star Wars Book]]'' states that dates that Dooku left the Jedi Order 42 years before the events of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]. Therefore he must have left the Jedi Order in [[42 BBY]]. As Palpatine met Dooku shortly before Dooku left the Order, it must have occurred in the same year.</ref> Palpatine was introduced to [[Dooku]], a Jedi, by the latter's former Padawan [[Rael Averross]], after the former [[Jedi Master]] delivered an address to the Galactic Senate on Coruscant. Following the [[Incident on Serenno|invasion of Serenno]], Dooku left the Jedi Order to claim the title of [[Count of Serenno|planetary count]],<ref name="Dooku Jedi Lost">''[[Dooku: Jedi Lost]]''</ref> but Sidious eventually recruited Dooku to the Sith<ref name="TCW Lost Missions Q&A">{{SWYouTube|KGBdRW7jjUk|Sifo-Dyas and the Sith - The Lost Missions Q&A &#124; Star Wars: The Clone Wars|sw_url=video/the-lost-missions-q-and-a-sifo-dyas-and-the-sith}}</ref> by exploiting his anger with the Republic<ref name="Rise">''[[Rise of the Separatists]]''</ref> despite also having Maul under his wing.<ref name="TCW Lost Missions Q&A" /> Indeed, Dooku would not yet become a Sith apprentice.<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" /> To fulfill Sidious' plans, Dooku [[Mission to Oba Diah (Sifo-Dyas)|betrayed and orchestrated]] the death of Jedi Master [[Sifo-Dyas]] and took over his clientele for the commission of a [[Cloning|clone]] army produced on [[Kamino]]; the event was subsequently covered up when Dooku erased all records of Kamino from the [[Jedi Archives]].<ref name="TLO">{{TCW|The Lost One}}</ref>

All the while, Palpatine maintained a faithful correspondence with Wilhuff Tarkin&mdash;whose service in the Judicial Department kept them from meeting face-to-face often&mdash;and supported bills in the Senate that would aid Eriadu and the Seswenna sector, Tarkin's homeworld and its sector, respectively. After Valorum's re-election, something Palpatine attributed to senatorial special interest groups who needed a weak chancellor, whispers began to swirl Valorum would be unable to hold onto power, with Palpatine's name emerging as a possible successor to the Chancellery. Around that time, Palpatine also met with Tarkin&mdash;who had grown disillusioned with the Judicial force&mdash;in his Coruscant office in one of their rare person-to-person meetings, where Palpatine urged Tarkin to enter planetary politics as Eriadu's new governor. Warning him something dark was brewing in their corner of the galaxy and promising Tarkin the support of himself and his shadowy allies, Palpatine convinced Tarkin, who promised to do whatever was best for Eriadu and the Republic in any manner Palpatine wished it to be done.<ref name="Tarkin" />

====Holding back Maul====
{{Quote|Remember that your anger is a tool. It is not your master."<br />"No. You are.|Darth Sidious and Darth Maul|<ref name="AoR Maul" />}}
[[File:AoR-DarthMaul-C-art.png|thumb|left|250px|Darth Sidious worked to curb Darth Maul's overenthusiasm to fight the Jedi lest his apprentice unwittingly ruin his carefully-laid plans and destroy them both.]]
In [[33 BBY]],<ref name="Maul 5 Date">''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]'' dates the events of ''Darth Maul'' (2017) 5 to [[33 BBY]].</ref> Sidious met with Maul in his hideout, the old [[Inquisitorius Headquarters|LiMerge Power Building]] in [[the Works]] industrial zone of Coruscant, to chide him on allowing Jedi to sense his presence. Sidious told his apprentice he did not care about his impatience, warning Maul that ruining his master's long-term plans would have severe consequences. Sidious then sent Maul to deal with a [[Unidentified pirate faction|group of pirates]] harassing their [[Kellux mining facilities|secret mining facilities]] in the [[Kellux system]].<ref name="Darth Maul 1">[[Darth Maul (2017) 1|''Darth Maul'' (2017) 1]]</ref> Sidious was secretly testing Maul's loyalty by setting him up with the opportunity to face a [[Eldra Kaitis|Jedi Padawan]]. Maul proceeded to unwittingly follow the path laid out for him and [[Skirmish on the moon of Drazkel|slew]] the Jedi. After his apprentice's return to Coruscant, Sidious revealed his knowledge of all of Maul's actions, asking if his apprentice was satisfied with having killed a Jedi. Sidious was pleased when Maul replied that he was not.<ref name="Darth Maul 5">[[Darth Maul (2017) 5|''Darth Maul'' (2017) 5]]</ref>

Not long after, during the course of activities in the [[Coruscant Underworld|Coruscant underworld]], Maul killed a [[Zek Peiro|Force-sensitive thief]] in an attempt to assuage his thirst to fight Jedi. Sidious called attention to the foolishness of such behavior, but Maul insisted that he had been careful enough to avoid leaving evidence that could alert the Jedi to the continued existence of the Sith. Sidious complimented Maul's anger but warned him that he needed to temper it with patience, which Maul responded to with frustration at still being held in check. Sidious reminded him that his training was not as complete as he assumed, taking him back to Malachor to revisit the site where years before Maul had undergone visions of the Sith being wiped out by the Jedi. Sidious instructed Maul to once again instigate another vision by breathing in the ashes of dead Sith warriors. Through the vision, Maul learned the value of patience since rage alone was not enough for he and and his master to defeat the combined might of the Jedi Order. Pleased, Sidious pointed out that a combination of patient planning with the power granted by the dark side would, in time, see them successfully destroy the Jedi.<ref name="AoR Maul">[[Age of Republic - Darth Maul 1|''Age of Republic - Darth Maul'' 1]]</ref>

====Meeting with the Jedi====
{{Quote|Why ''this'' shade of blue?"<br />"There's no accounting for taste. I sometimes wonder what it would look like in red.|Adi Gallia and Sheev Palpatine|<ref name="The Living Force" />}}
Around this time,<ref name="TLFDate">According to {{InsiderCite|224|Launchpad}}, ''The Living Force'' takes place one [[Standard year|year]] before the events of {{Film|I}}, which equates to [[33 BBY]] per ''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]''.</ref> Palpatine met, as he frequently did, with Chancellor Valorum and [[Jedi Master| Jedi Masters]] [[Yoda]] and [[Adi Gallia]] to discuss diplomatic matters of relevance to the Republic and the Jedi Order. One item of interest were the labor strikes on [[Garqi]] and [[Chamble]]; for the latter, Palpatine suggested that the Jedi stage a training mission there. Another topic was how to handle a shipment of garish boots sent by the new member world [[Hafernia]] as a gift for the Order. Gallia was uncomfortable at the idea of accepting them, stating that Jedi did not endorse products. Palpatine replied that they ''did'' endorse the Republic and good governance. Ultimately, the group decided that the Order would accept the boots in name only.<ref name="The Living Force">''[[The Living Force]]''</ref>

Gallia was then briefly called away to speak with Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]]. When she returned, Palpatine handed her a datapad outlining the actions he and Valorum had proposed thus far. Before rejoining the main conversation, the two covertly discussed their aesthetic disagreement with the deep shade of blue that Valorum had chosen post-reelection, with Palpatine wondering what the room would look like in red. Shortly after, Palpatine and Valorum became aware of the [[Jedi High Council |Jedi Council]]'s plan to visit [[Kwenn]] and contacted Master [[Mace Windu]] to discuss the matter.<ref name="The Living Force" />

====Eliminating a pawn====
{{Quote|You are old. Too old, to be of much further service to the Jedi—or me. And besides, my interests have changed."<br />"What do you mean?"<br />"The pieces are almost in place for the grand game. The Republic, the Trade Federation, the rest—all are poised to play their roles. It serves me to have the Jedi Order constantly moving around, following the whims of commerce and the Senate. Shuffling forces and dividing their attention.|Darth Sidious and Voh|<ref name="The Living Force" />}}
After the Jedi Council's [[Mission to Kwenn|defense of Kwenn]] from pirate forces commanded by the [[Riftwalkers|Riftwalker]] leader [[Zilastra]] and the destruction of the Order's [[Sanctuary Mount]] [[Jedi outpost|outpost]], Sidious contacted the installation's former [[Seneschal]], an elderly [[Bimm]] named [[Voh]], by holocomm. Sidious had, in the guise of Senator Palpatine, made an arrangement with Voh to maintain the Senate's interest in Kwenn, such that the Jedi kept the outpost open, in exchange for Jedi texts from its library that Sidious considered important. They had also agreed that anything Palpatine was not interested in would be destroyed to help obscure the fact that they were missing. However, Sidious discovered that Voh had instead sold off the remaining material, unable to bring himself to eradicate historical documents; and that during the Council's time on Kwenn, Master [[Eeth Koth]] had discovered items were missing from the library and located some of the minor ones in a [[Lamplighter Boutique|local shop]]. When presented with this, Voh argued that the evidence of the theft was gone with the outpost and that he could finagle his way into a position at another outpost and continue supplying Palpatine with Jedi works.<ref name="The Living Force" />

However, Sidious was not interested in continuing to deal with Voh and stated as much. The Sith Lord explained to the confused Bimm that he was no longer interested in Kwenn, in fact that he was pleased to see the Jedi closing outposts and moving around the galaxy in a reactionary manner, all of which would benefit plans he would soon put into effect involving the Republic and the Trade Federation. Sidious stated that Zilastra's scheme had impressed him and that she would be of further interest, although he was not surprised that she had ultimately failed in her endeavor against the Jedi. The Sith Lord also pointed out that Voh was too old to be of much further use to himself or the Jedi. When the bewildered Bimm asked why Palpatine had so radically changed his attitude and why he was telling him all of this, Sidious replied that it was for another being's ears, indicating his apprentice Darth Maul, who had entered the room and proceeded to deal with the former Seneschal.<ref name="The Living Force" />

===War on Naboo===
====Invasion of Naboo====
{{Quote|Orchestrating a conflict on my homeworld of Naboo, I sowed the seeds of civil unrest. Chaos erupted within the Senate&mdash;a chaos I controlled on every front.|Darth Sidious|<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" />}}
[[File:Tey_How_Gunray_Haako_and_Sidious.png|thumb|250px|Sidious orchestrated the Invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation, which was under his influence.]]
Sidious, as Palpatine, moved to seize power from Supreme Chancellor [[Finis Valorum]], who had virtually no political power and counted Palpatine as a close friend and ally, allowing for Sidious to easily manipulate him.<ref name="SWEValorum">{{SWE|characters|valorum|Supreme Chancellor Valorum}}</ref> In the Senate, Sidious secretly ensured that the Senate repeatedly battled over bills concerning taxation, bringing about voting sessions that ended in both Federation defeats and victories, while Gunray falsely believed Sidious was working towards Federation victories all the time. Following a discussion in his [[Emperor's office|office]] about the [[Prop 31-814D|latest version of the bill]], Valorum requested Palpatine to stay behind and confided in him that he was considering having a Jedi step in to serve as an independent moderator, which Palpatine appeared to be surprised by before requesting he hold off on that option for the time being. Moving up his plans upon being told of the [[Chommell sector summit]] that threatened to strengthen the sector,<ref name="Queen's Peril" /> Sidious used holographic communication to convince Gunray to blockade the planet Naboo, making it seem as though it was in protest of the Senate's taxation of trade routes to outlying [[star system]]s. Eventually, driven to desperation by the inactivity of the Senate, Valorum secretly dispatched two [[Jedi Knight]]s&mdash;Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his [[Padawan]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]&mdash;as [[ambassador]]s to negotiate with the Trade Federation's [[Neimoidian]] leaders.<ref name="Episode I" />

With Sidious pleasantly surprised at the ingenuity the Geonosians had shown in creating the Federation's battle droid army,<ref name="Queen's Peril" /> the Trade Federation initiated the [[Invasion of Naboo]] on the orders of Sidious, who also instructed Gunray to kill Chancellor Valorum's Jedi ambassadors. When Gunray questioned the legality of the invasion, Sidious simply stated that he would make it legal. The Neimoidians acted accordingly, but the Jedi survived the [[assassin]]ation attempt and [[Escape from the Saak'ak|escaped]] the [[Lucrehulk-class battleship|Federation ship]]. After Sidious terminated his communication with Gunray, [[Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala]] contacted him concerning the Federation's denial that the Chancellor had sent ambassadors to speak with them as promised. Sidious, as Palpatine, feigned concern at this supposed revelation, but was cut off mid-sentence by the Trade Federation's communication blackout, notifying the Naboo to their invasion.<ref name="Episode I" />

====The Queen's escape====
{{Quote|At last, we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last, we will have revenge.|Darth Maul, to Darth Sidious|audio=RevengeAtLast-TPM.flac|<ref name="Episode I" />}}
The Federation's [[droid]] army proceeded with their assault. Within a day, the army [[Capture of Theed|occupied]] the planet's capital city and its surrounding regions. Additionally, Amidala and her retinue were captured and presented with a treaty that would bring an air of legitimacy to their invasion. However, the Jedi arrived to rescue them, and they successfully evaded the blockade aboard the queen's [[J-type 327 Nubian royal starship|starship]].<ref name="Episode I" />

[[File:Sith_Lords_Trade_Federation.png|thumb|left|250px|Queen Padmé Amidala escaped from the Trade Federation, causing Sidious to send Maul after her.]]
When Gunray informed Sidious of Amidala's failure to sign the treaty, the livid Sith [[Lord]] introduced them to Darth Maul, whom he dispatched to find and recapture Amidala. Due to Amidala's ship sustaining damage in the escape, the queen opted to land on [[Tatooine]], an obscure desert world in the [[Outer Rim Territories]], to repair the ship. Maul managed to ascertain the queen's location, and assured his master that his search on the sparsely populated world would be a short one. Sidious told him to move against the Jedi first, and then take the queen once they were dead. Maul left for Tatooine, but he [[Duel on Tatooine|failed]] to kill the Jedi or retrieve Amidala. Sidious knew she would come to Coruscant if Maul failed.<ref name="Episode I" />

====The Senate====
{{Quote|Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will disappear.|Sheev Palpatine, to Padmé Amidala|<ref name="Episode I" />}}
While waiting for Amidala to reach Coruscant, Sidious found he had little to do, although he made sure to go to the Senate to vote on its current matters, even though he did not care for them. With nothing else to do, Palpatine took to looking through his catalogue of art, having run out of space in his office to store the rest of his collection. He stopped his scrolling when he saw a black statue known as the [[Yonta Prime]], which, despite being one of his favorite pieces, he found he could not fit into his office without looking careless. He resolved to take it out of storage, ordering it to be taken to his [[Palpatine's apartment|apartment]], so he could place it into the Supreme Chancellor's office when his current plan had finished.<ref name="Queen's Peril" />

[[File:Amidala_arrives_on_Coruscant.png|thumb|250px|Senator Palpatine personally welcomed Queen Amidala to Coruscant, the capital world of the Galactic Republic.]]
Despite these setbacks, Palpatine was able to convene with Amidala on [[Coruscant]], where she intended to plead her case to Chancellor Valorum before the Galactic Senate. Bringing Amidala to his apartment for an audience, Palpatine told the queen that the senate was long past caring about the common good, while Valorum was essentially powerless against them. With both the Senate and Valorum closed off to her as options, Palpatine offered her two choices: she could move for a [[Vote of No Confidence]] in Chancellor Valorum, and push for the election of a more effective leader; or she could take the matter to the courts, which would take even longer. Hoping still to reach some resolution to the matter in the Senate, Amidala opted to attend the special session of the body the next day.<ref name="Episode I" />

[[File:Amidalabeforesenate.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Faced with a growing crisis on Naboo, Amidala heeded Palpatine's advice, calling for stronger leadership in the Senate.]]
During the awaited Senate session, Amidala attempted to make her case for Republic intervention to stop the Trade Federation's occupation of her world. However, the Federation representative [[Lott Dod]] fervently objected to the "accusations" levied against the Federation, citing that there was no proof that an invasion or occupation had even occurred. He recommended that a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth of the situation, a motion that was seconded by the senator from [[Malastare]], [[Aks Moe]]. [[Vice Chair]] [[Mas Amedda]] conferred quietly with Valorum for a few moments, and Palpatine took the opportunity to predict that the Chancellor, shackled to Senatorial procedure at the behest of bureaucrats who were more than likely on the payroll of the Federation, would fail to help Naboo. When Valorum reluctantly admitted that the Federation was within their rights to request a commission, an outraged Amidala realized that Palpatine was right; Valorum was too weak and ineffectual to provide her world with the help it needed. As such, she took Palpatine's advice and publicly moved for a Vote of No Confidence in the Chancellor. Within moments, hundreds of Senators began demanding for an immediate vote, leaving Valorum thunderstruck.<ref name="Episode I" />

The sudden power vacuum led to Palpatine's nomination as Supreme Chancellor alongside [[Bail Antilles]] of [[Alderaan]] and [[Ainlee Teem]] of Malastare. When he announced his nomination to Amidala, however, the queen declared her intention to return to Naboo and reclaim it from the Trade Federation by whatever means she could. Palpatine made a show of concern and tried halfheartedly to convince her to stay on Coruscant. She left regardless, taking both Jinn and Kenobi with her for protection and wishing Palpatine success in the [[Supreme Chancellor election, 32 BBY|election]].<ref name="Episode I" />

====Battle of Naboo====
{{Quote|Wipe them out. ''All'' of them.|Darth Sidious, to Nute Gunray|<ref name="Episode I" />}}
[[File:Sidious_hologram.png|thumb|250px|Sidious ordered the Trade Federation to eradicate the Gungan army upon learning of their alliance with Queen Amidala.]]
Sidious contacted the Neimoidians on Naboo, instructing them to kill Amidala upon arrival, and sent Maul to accompany them with orders to make certain the Neimoidians killed the queen, and that the Jedi fell by his own hand. Even while he managed the election on Coruscant, he made time to go over the Neimoidians' progress. Against his expectations, he learned that Amidala not only managed to escape Gunray's reach but also forged an alliance with the [[Gungan]]s and assembled an [[Gungan Grand Army|army]] in the planet swamp in preparation for a strike against the Federation occupation force. He doubted she would last even five minutes in such a contest, and gave his approval to Gunray's plan to [[Battle of Naboo|meet]] the Gungans head-on.<ref name="Episode I" />

====Confrontation in the LiMerge Power building====
{{Quote|Sifo-Dyas, Kamino, the clones. I have betrayed everyone and everything I know.''"<br />"''No, you have been loyal to a greater cause.''"<br />"''How many have died because of my actions?''"<br />"''Such is the price of freedom.|Dooku and Darth Sidious|<ref name="The Sith Lord">{{TOTJ|The Sith Lord}}</ref>}}
However, the Federation army was defeated, Gunray was captured by Amidala's forces, and Maul met his presumed death at the hands of the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, though not before striking down Qui-Gon Jinn. Darth Sidious showed no remorse towards the Zabrak warrior and prepared to take on a new Sith apprentice to advance in his plans. Having learned of Jinn's death, [[Count]] Dooku traveled to their meeting place, the LiMerge Power Building in the Works, to confront Sidious, infuriated that his ally's schemes had resulted in the death of his former apprentice.<ref name="The Sith Lord" />

[[File:Sidious_Watches_Dooku_Yaddle_Duel.png|thumb|left|250px|Count Dooku met with Darth Sidious on Coruscant, where his alliance with the Sith Lord would be discovered by Jedi Master Yaddle.]]
As Dooku accused Sidious of making him betray everything and everyone he had known, Sidious affirmed that Dooku's actions had been in the service of a greater good, and the galaxy required sacrifices in order to be remade. Dooku pondered that Qui-Gon Jinn could have been a powerful ally, in which Sidious acknowledged the truth, conceding that it would have indeed been advantageous for Dooku. Despite everything Dooku has done for him, Sidious admitted that he always questioned his loyalty, much to Dooku's disturbance. Defending his commitment, Dooku pointed out that he had carried out every task entrusted to him. Sidious then revealed that even greater demands lay ahead if they were to achieve their goals.<ref name="The Sith Lord" />

Unbeknownst to them, [[Yaddle]] had followed Dooku in secret, and urged Dooku to surrender and help her defeat Sidious. Dooku hesitated initially but then, on Sidious' orders, [[Duel in the Works|engaged]] Yaddle in a [[lightsaber duel]] as a final test of loyalty. In spite of Yaddle's great effort, Dooku's unrivaled dueling capabilities quickly began to overwhelm her. Yaddle called out to Dooku, admitting that the [[Jedi High Council]] had been wrong and informing him that as a result, she had stepped down from her position on the Council. Her last attempt at persuading Dooku failed, and they dueled once more, as Sidious watched and cackled manically.<ref name="The Sith Lord" />

[[File:Sidious-Tyranus-TotJ.png|thumb|250px|Sidious took Dooku as his new Sith apprentice after the fallen Jedi killed Yaddle.]]
As Dooku knocked Yaddle into the frame of the large doorway, he used the Force to flip the lever controlling the door, which came crashing down onto his former friend. Collapsing in sorrow over what he had just done, Dooku was reassured by Sidious, who congratulated his "friend" and apprentice. To their shock, Yaddle suddenly lifted the doorway off in one final display of her immense Force power. Lying defenseless and exhausted at Dooku's feet, Dooku impaled her with his [[Dooku's lightsaber|lightsaber]].<ref name="The Sith Lord" /> As Sidious' new Sith apprentice, Dooku adopted the secret name of Darth Tyranus.<ref name="Dooku DB">{{Databank|count-dooku|Count Dooku}}</ref>

Ultimately, Palpatine won the election for Supreme Chancellor, and later attended at the [[Funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn|funeral of Jinn]]. Palpatine also learned that the Naboo owed their victory to the unexpected intervention of [[Anakin Skywalker]], a young, freed slave from Tatooine who was highly attuned to the Force, fueling the belief that he was the [[Chosen One]] of Jedi prophecy who would bring balance to the Force. After much debate, the Jedi Council decided that Skywalker would be apprenticed to Kenobi as a Jedi. Palpatine personally congratulated the two Jedi during the celebration on Naboo, telling young Skywalker that his career would be watched with "great interest."<ref name="Episode I" />

===Further preparations===
====Preparing for war====
{{Quote|They said Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for a clone army at the request of the Senate almost ten years ago. I was under the impression that he was killed before that.|Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Mace Windu and Yoda regarding the Kaminoans|<ref name="Episode II" />}}
[[File:Sidious_Tyranus.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious orchestrated the Separatist Crisis to destabilize the Republic, all the while training Darth Tyranus as his new apprentice.]]
Over the next ten years,<ref name="explEPII">{{SW|url=films/star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones|text=''Star Wars: Attack of the Clones''}} {{C|Story Gallery: Slide 4}}</ref> Supreme Chancellor Palpatine amassed a favorable reputation as a mild-mannered servant of the common good, and the public remained oblivious to his true, insidious persona.<ref name="SWEPalpatine" /><ref name="Episode II" /> He kept one of his lightsabers hidden in a statue of<ref name="FF 117 Palpatine">{{FactFile2014|117|LIG 19-20|Palpatine's lightsabers}}</ref> [[Sistros Nevet]],<ref name="Dok Den">{{GEAttr|Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities}}</ref> which was coated in [[neuranium]] and thus protected from scans, while the other was kept in an unknown hiding place.<ref name="FF 117 Palpatine" /> As Anakin Skywalker grew older, his relationship with Palpatine deepened; on many occasions, Palpatine lauded Skywalker as the most gifted Jedi he had ever encountered, one who would surpass even Yoda, the [[Grand Master]] of the Jedi Council. Skywalker, who grew increasingly frustrated with the strict lifestyle of the Jedi under his master Kenobi's guidance, appreciated Palpatine's praise and greatly took to his counsel. In truth, this was all part of Sidious' plan to gain Skywalker's trust and groom him into his eventual Sith apprentice.<ref name="SWEPalpatine" /><ref name="Episode II" />

However, Sidious was well aware that his plan to turn Skywalker to the dark side could not bear fruit for many years to come, and with Maul presumed dead, Sidious needed an apprentice in the interim. As such, he turned to Dooku to fill that role,<ref name="SWEDooku">{{SWE|characters|dooku|Count Dooku}}</ref> making the former Jedi his interim apprentice under the name Darth Tyranus.<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" /> Sidious and Tyranus gained control of a [[behavioral modification biochip]] that Sifo-Dyas wanted instilled in each clone as a safeguard against [[Dark Jedi|rogue Jedi]],<ref name="Conspiracy">{{TCW|Conspiracy}}</ref> and the two then retooled the chip for Sidious' purpose.<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" /> Subsequently, [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]] was hired as the [[Clone template|genetic template]] for the clone army on Kamino,<ref name="Episode II" /> and the clones were fitted with the Sith's retooled biochip, the latter containing a [[Order 66|protocol]] that would ensure their total obedience to Sidious when the time came for it.<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" />

In [[26 BBY]],<ref name="AoR Dooku Year">''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]'' dates the events of ''Age of Republic - Count Dooku'' 1 to [[26 BBY]].</ref> Sidious sent Tyranus to [[Sullust]] to negotiate with the [[SoroSuub Corporation]]. Tyranus soon reported back that a [[Jak'zin|Jedi Knight]] was present on the planet. Uncertain as to what the Jedi's purpose there was, Sidious told his apprentice to uncover the reason for his presence and to keep the Jedi from discovering the alliances Count Dooku was forging on behalf of the Sith, ostensibly for Serenno. Tyranus was successful in this endeavor and also covertly eliminated the Jedi, under the guise of helping him investigate the [[Kaldana Syndicate]].<ref name="AoR Dooku">[[Age of Republic - Count Dooku 1|''Age of Republic - Count Dooku'' 1]]</ref>

====Galli and the Contingency====
{{Quote|You will go back to Jakku. The spot there in the dirt where my droids were operating is precious. Not just to me, but to the galaxy at large. It is significant&hellip; You will go back there and you will monitor my droids excavating the ground. Then I will send more droids and they will build something there below the ground.

[[File:Jakku_view.jpg|thumb|250px|Sidious discovered Galli, an orphan who grew up to become Gallius Rax, while visiting the frontier world of Jakku.]]
In [[25 BBY]],<ref name="Galli Date">[[Gallius Rax]]'s prelude and epilogue chapters in ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' are set three decades before the [[Battle of Jakku]], which takes place in [[5 ABY]].</ref> Sidious and his Adviser [[Yupe Tashu]] traveled to the barren [[Inner Rim Territories|Inner Rim]] planet of [[Jakku]], which lay at the edge of the [[Unknown Regions]]. After landing his yacht ''[[Imperialis]]'' in the [[Plaintive Hand plateau]], Tashu ordered a detachment of six droids to begin excavating. The yacht soon left off-world but a local twelve-year-old boy named [[Gallius Rax|Galli]] snuck aboard the ''Imperialis''. Sidious easily sensed his presence and found the boy, he gave the Galli the choice of dying or serving him. Sidious then instructed Galli to return to the excavation site and guard it against any intruders. He stressed that intruders should not be allowed to taint the site and ordered Galli to kill them. Sidious then introduced himself on a first-name basis as Sheev.<ref name="Aftermath: Life Debt" />

For the next ten years, Galli guarded the Plaintive Hand excavation site, killing anyone who approached and recruiting several others to assist him. In [[15 BBY]], Sidious finally returned and invited the boy aboard the ''Imperialis'' this time as a guest of honor. By that stage, work on the [[Jakku Observatory]] had been completed. Using a game of [[Shah-tezh]] as an illustration, Sidious explained that his future Galactic Empire could not be allowed to outlive its [[Emperor]] should he die prematurely. To demonstrate his seriousness, Sidious Force choked Galli. He tasked Galli with executing his secret [[Contingency]] plan and inducted the boy into Imperial service.<ref name="Empire's End">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref> Galli subsequently joined the [[Naval Intelligence Agency]] as a [[commander]]<ref name="Aftermath: Life Debt" /> and adopted the name Gallius Rax.<ref name="Empire's End" />

====Laying the foundations====
{{Quote|You don't need guidance, Anakin. In time, you will learn to trust your feelings. Then, you will be invincible.

[[File:DarthSidiousAndFutureApprentice-ObiWanAnakin3.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious, as Palpatine, befriended Anakin Skywalker, knowing the young Jedi had the potential to become a powerful Sith.]]
As Anakin Skywalker grew older, the relationship between Palpatine and the young Jedi greatly deepened. On many occasions, the Chancellor attended the boy's training at the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]], expressing appreciation for the progress reached by the young Padawan in [[lightsaber combat]]. Seeing that the boy was deeply conditioned by his emotions, Palpatine asked Master Mace Windu to send Skywalker to him, saying he could help with the boy's formation.<ref name="O&A I">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 1|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 1]]</ref> When Skywalker arrived in the company of his Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Palpatine asked to be accompanied by Skywalker for an errand in the lower levels of Coruscant. Dismissing Master Kenobi's reminder that Skywalker was not yet a Jedi and dangers could lie ahead, the Chancellor brought Skywalker to [[Level 2685]]. Both disguised as travellers, Palpatine told the youth that he himself frequented the area when his duties permitted it&mdash;to try to do some good. Eventually, the duo arrived at [[Club Kasakar]].<ref name="O&A II">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 2|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 2]]</ref>

There, Palpatine expressed some form of envy in the life of young Jedi Padawans, that was already decided from an early age, in difference with his political life, one of troubling choices and difficult decisions. He also explained that the Club was full of Senators. In particular, he pointed out Senator [[Colandrus]], a [[Tarsunt]] who often went there for gambling. While the Tarsunt senator was betting at a game table, Palpatine said that Colandrus was corrupt, but there were no proofs of it. Inspired by the unflattering description, Anakin used Jedi [[telekinesis]] to rig Colandrus' last [[Chance cube|die]], making him lose large sums of [[Galactic Credit Standard|money]]. Hearing the disguised Palpatine laugh at his misfortune, Colandrus sicced his [[bodyguard]] on him, but the Chancellor defused the situation by explaining that "his son" had just made a joke, and promised that they would leave at once. Still unconvinced, Colandrus nevertheless allowed the cloaked nuisances to go freely.<ref name="O&A III">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 3|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 3]]</ref>

[[File:Sith_to_be.png|thumb|250px|Skywalker's potential convinced Palpatine that the young Padawan could become the greatest of all the Jedi.]]
Once the duo returned back to the Chancellor's office, Palpatine "apologized" to Anakin for involving him in a Senate matter. Anakin said the Jedi could arrest Senator Colandrus, but Palpatine replied that the Jedi were not required to obey him because if they did, he would be like a dictator and that wasn't his wish. He also told the boy not to talk about what had happened to them with his masters and further asked if Anakin was happy in the temple. When the Padawan answered positively, Palpatine felt the truth of it through the Force. Eventually, Palpatine thanked him for his decisive role in the Battle of Naboo, and said there would always be a place for Anakin near him, and that he could make extraordinary use of a young man like Anakin.<ref name="O&A IV">[[Obi-Wan and Anakin 4|''Obi-Wan and Anakin'' 4]]</ref>

Palpatine continued to act as a confidant to Skywalker, providing guidance to the young Padawan who trained to become a true Jedi.<ref name="Episode II" /> Skywalker was grateful to Palpatine, and viewed the chancellor as a mentor as well as a friend.<ref name="Episode III" /> In private, Palpatine expressed to Skywalker his confidence in him, including his belief that Skywalker's power would eventually eclipse the combined strength of the Jedi Order, including Grand Master Yoda.<ref name="Episode II" />

===The Clone Wars===

====Early campaigns====

=====Separatist crisis=====
{{Quote|I love democracy. I love the Republic. The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has abated. And as my first act with this new authority, I will create a grand army of the Republic to counter the increasing threats of the separatists.|Sheev Palpatine|<ref name="Episode II" />}}
[[File:Chancellors_Office.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious' public façade required him to work with the leaders of the Jedi Order, the ancient enemies of the Sith.]]
Under Sidious' direction, Tyranus rallied several thousand solar systems into declaring independence from the Galactic Republic, [[Separatist Crisis|instead joining]] the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] with himself as its leader.<ref name="Episode II" /> Two years after the Confederacy [[Raxus Address|was founded]],<ref name="Rise">''[[Rise of the Separatists]]''</ref> civil war seemed to be imminent and the Jedi's numbers were too few to maintain galactic peace. The Senate pushed for a vote to [[Military Creation Act|create]] a [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. Keeping his true motives a secret,<ref name="Episode II" /> Palpatine resisted all of the Senate's attempts to create an army and the push to go to war with the Confederacy.<ref name="Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel">''[[Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel]]''</ref> Around [[23 BBY]],<ref name="23Date">{{DookuJediLostDate}}</ref> Dooku's sister [[Jenza]], who had become aware of his dealings with Sidious but only knew him as "the hooded man," urged her brother to abandon his plans, warning him that Sidious was corrupting him. Dooku instead ordered his assassin and apprentice [[Asajj Ventress]], who at that time was unaware of Sidious's existence, to kill his sister, which she reluctantly followed through with.<ref name="Dooku Jedi Lost" />

In [[22 BBY]],<ref name="Timelines" /> after arriving on Coruscant to vote on the creation of an army, former Queen Padmé Amidala&mdash;by that time the Senator of Naboo&mdash;narrowly avoided an [[Plot to assassinate Senator Amidala|assassination attempt]] carried out by [[Zam Wesell]] on behalf of the vengeful Nute Gunray. Palpatine had the vote delayed and placed the senator under the protection of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, her old allies from the Battle of Naboo. After a second attempt on the senator's life was made, Skywalker was assigned to protect her back on her homeworld of Naboo. There the two secretly started to fall in love which, coupled with Skywalker's later [[Mission to rescue Shmi Skywalker Lars|discovery]] of his mother [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi's]] death at the hands of [[Tusken Raider]]s on the planet Tatooine, would bring the young Jedi ever closer to the dark side of the force, and even more vulnerable to Sidious' deceptive machinations.<ref name="Episode II" />

[[File:Parade.png|thumb|250px|Secession gave way to the Clone Wars, allowing Palpatine to create the Grand Army of the Republic with his emergency powers.]]
However, when it was revealed that the Separatists were secretly building a battle droid army with the support of many commercial organizations, including the Trade Federation. Palpatine used the situation to have himself granted emergency powers from the Senate by Representative Jar Jar Binks. Palpatine feigned reluctance to accept this authority, promising to return it to the Senate once the crisis ended. His first act was to allow the use of the clone army, which had been [[Mission to Kamino (Separatist Crisis)|discovered]] by Kenobi on Kamino, to counter the Separatist threat; this resulted in the [[First Battle of Geonosis]], which served as the opening salvo of the [[Clone Wars]]. After clone template Jango Fett was killed and his Separatist partners escaped the battle, Tyranus met with Sidious at the Coruscant tower in the Works with good news that the war the Sith had been orchestrating had begun, as well as preliminary blueprints for a Geonosian [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|superweapon]] that could be of use to their future Sith-led regime. Sidious was pleased with the turn of events, and he later, with the leaders of the Senate, oversaw the new Republic army marching towards war, while Palpatine additionally would be able to deceive both sides from the start of the war. Skywalker and Amidala secretly [[Wedding of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala|wed]] on Naboo. The sole witnesses<ref name="Episode II" /> to the clandestine ceremony were their two droids, [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]], and a [[Maxiron Agolerga|local holy man]] who officiated the rite.<ref name="CL2016" /> However, the secret was unknowingly passed to Sidious, which the Sith Lord would later use during his quest to lure Skywalker into becoming his next apprentice.<ref name="Episode III" />

=====Converting future servants=====
{{Quote|I enjoyed our talk, Iskat Akaris, and I will take your thoughts into consideration. I feel certain you have a bright future ahead of you.|Sheev Palpatine, to Iskat Akaris|<ref name="Inquisitor: Rise of the Red Blade">''[[Inquisitor: Rise of the Red Blade]]''</ref>}}
At some point, Sidious infiltrated the Jedi Temple with a number of agents, including the former Padawan [[Heezo]], ordering them to identify Jedi dissatisfied with the Order and covertly nudge them towards the dark side. Shortly after the [[mission to Thule]], he met with the Jedi High Council. On his way to their [[Jedi Council Chamber|chamber]], he was escorted by one such Jedi, the Knight [[Thirteenth Sister|Iskat Akaris]]. Sidious took advantage of the opportunity by getting her to voice her secretly held opinions of the Order to him while subtly encouraging her darker impulses. Palpatine would be escorted by Akaris to meet with the Council several more times throughout the Clone Wars.<ref name="Inquisitor: Rise of the Red Blade" />

Meanwhile, a new cropping of senators would emerge as wartime-elected representatives. This new grouping of senators were much more likely than their pre-existing counterparts to support Palpatine. In fact, Palpatine handpicked some of the senators who came into the government during the war, yet even those who had not been selected by the Chancellor would display a great reverence for the man.<ref name="MoF">''[[Reign of the Empire: The Mask of Fear]]''</ref>

=====Negotiations with the Hutts=====
{{Quote|Soon, the Jedi will not only be at war with you, Count, but the Hutt Clan as well.|Darth Sidious, to Darth Tyranus|audio=WithTheHuttClanAsWell-TCWf.flac|<ref name="TCW film">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]]</ref>}}
[[File:Count_Dooku_speaks_with_Darth_Sidious.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious and Tyranus controlled both sides in the galactic conflict as Chancellor Palpatine and Count Dooku.]]
After the Confederacy's Droid Army seized control of the major [[Hyperspace route|hyperspace lanes]], Sidious had Tyranus and his assassin, [[Asajj Ventress]], kidnap the [[Hutt Clan]]s' [[Grand Hutt Council|Council]] leader, [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba's]] son, [[Rotta]]. Once they had reached [[Teth]], Sidious contacted both Ventress and Tyranus. He assured them that the Jedi would be at war with the Hutts as well as the Confederacy. As Palpatine, he then received a message from Jabba, asking for help in rescuing his son. Despite Master Windu's reservations about allying the Republic with the Hutt, Palpatine knew they needed the Hutt's space lanes to move their troops. Despite General Grievous spreading the Republic forces thin, Windu told Palpatine that Skywalker and Kenobi could carry out the rescue.<ref name="TCW film" />

The eruption of several new battles across the Outer Rim, including those relating the Hutt endeavor, gave Palpatine the ability to implement a series of new secruity measures on Naboo, something that came to Senator Amidala's attention and resulted in her requesting a chance to speak with the Chancellor. During the rescue, Palpatine learned that Jabba believed that the Jedi were behind his son's kidnapping and told Amidala of this when she arrived to discuss his new security plans. Jabba refused to speak with him, so Amidala decided to speak with Jabba's uncle [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]] at his [[Ziro's Palace|palace]], despite Palpatine's warning. Kenobi, Skywalker, and his new Padawan, [[Ahsoka Tano]], were able to return Rotta to his father and secure a treaty with the Hutts. Following the events, Sidious spoke with his apprentice about this setback. He assured Tyranus that the war was turning in their favor.<ref name="TCW film" />

=====Gunray's capture=====
{{Quote|Gunray's capture could be a serious threat to us, my friend.|Darth Sidious, to Darth Tyranus|<ref name="Cloak of Darkness">{{TCW|Cloak of Darkness}}</ref>}}
Palpatine learned that Senator Amidala had moved through enemy territory into the Outer Rim, causing him to contact her aboard her [[H-type Nubian yacht]]. Amidala explained that an old family friend, Senator Farr of [[Rodia]], had asked for her personally, as his people were starving. Palpatine claimed to understand, although he argued that she should have a clone trooper escort. However, Amidala had trust in diplomacy. After Representative Binks tried to talk to Palpatine, he caused C-3PO's chair to move, knocking the Gungan down and causing the ship to veer off course. Amidala was able to regain control, but Palpatine discreetly urged her to keep Binks out of the negotiations, which she agreed to.<ref name="Bombad Jedi">{{TCW|Bombad Jedi}}</ref>

[[File:Sidious_Dooku_Talk_2.png|thumb|250px|Sidious ordered Tyranus to retrieve Nute Gunray, not wanting the Jedi to learn of what he knew.]]
Yet once Amidala was planet-side, she learned Farr had joined the Separatists to help his people, and she was captured by Nute Gunray's battle droids. However, Binks helped disrupt the Separatist's plans and Farr decided to side with the Republic. Thanks to a message sent by C-3PO, the [[41st Elite Corps]] arrived on the planet and captured Gunray. Palpatine contacted them via hologram, stating that Amidala had brought Rodia's needs to his attention. The Chancellor had deployed a [[convoy]] of supply ships and stated that Gunray's capture was a major Republic victory.<ref name="Bombad Jedi" />

However, the secret Sith Lord saw the danger Nute Gunray's capture posed, as the viceroy would not last under the Jedi's questioning. Contacting Darth Tyranus, Sidious was informed by his apprentice that Asajj Ventress could infiltrate the Republic warship, allowing her to rescue or kill Gunray. While Sidious was apprehensive about using an agent who had previously failed them in the past, Tyranus argued that she was a skilled assassin. Ultimately, the master allowed his pupil to proceed in this plan; Ventress successfully [[Rescue on the Tranquility|rescued]] Nute Gunray, denying the Jedi and the Republic the opportunity to extract secret information from the Separatist leader, whilst also demonstrating her ability to handle a [[Star Destroyer]]'s contingent of clone troopers, a Jedi Padawan, and a Jedi Master all at once.<ref name="Cloak of Darkness" />

=====Chancellor at war=====
{{Quote|With the final votes tallied, let it be known that the motion to stop the creation of more clone troops has failed, and the continued manufacturing of clone troopers shall proceed as scheduled.|Sheev Palpatine|<ref name="Senate Murders">{{TCW|Senate Murders}}</ref>}}
[[File:PalpatineRepublicArmy.png|thumb|left|250px|As a result of the Clone Wars, the Republic became a militarized state under Chancellor Palpatine.]]
As the war got underway, Dooku [[Skirmish at Vanqor|crash-landed]] his ship on [[Vanqor]] and was captured by the [[Ohnaka Gang]]. Kenobi and Skywalker were sent to verify their leader [[Hondo Ohnaka]]'s demand for a reward,<ref name="Dooku Captured">{{TCW|Dooku Captured}}</ref> and then sent Senator [[Kharrus]] and Representative Binks to [[Mission to Florrum|deliver]] it. Ultimately, Dooku escaped from the [[pirate]]s.<ref name="The Gungan General">{{TCW|The Gungan General}}</ref>

Sidious paid [[Cad Bane]] to [[Raid on the Jedi Temple|steal]] a [[Holocron]] from the Jedi Temple's [[Holocron Vault]],<ref name="Holocron Heist">{{TCW|Holocron Heist}}</ref> which when used in conjunction with the [[kyber memory crystal]] would reveal the location of [[Force-sensitive]] infants across the galaxy.<ref name="Cargo of Doom">{{TCW|Cargo of Doom}}</ref> He had Bane kidnap these children to his [[Darth Sidious's secret facility|facility]] on [[Mustafar]] to commence the [[Project Harvester|creation]] of an army of Force-sensitive spies, Sidious told the nanny droids of the children's natural talent and how he would harness that power for his own needs. Looking into the future, Sidious saw a vision of Force talented spies trained in the dark side that would appear in every corner of the galaxy doing his bidding. The nanny droid told the Dark Lord that subjects rarely survive the procedure at a young age but Sidious said the risk was necessary and that if the procedure failed he would lose nothing. As the surgery was about to happen, an alert from a nanny droid told the Sith Lord of an incoming shuttle that was approaching and it did not belong to the bounty hunter. This surprised Sidious as he did not foresee this and ordered the droids to evacuate the children and destroy the facility to protect his identity and ended the transmission quickly. the Jedi foiled Bane and [[Mission to Mustafar (Skywalker and Tano)|rescued]] the [[youngling]]s.<ref name="Children of the Force">{{TCW|Children of the Force}}</ref>

[[File:Dr_Boll_confers_with_Palpatine.jpg|thumb|250px|Working with Doctor Sionver Boll, Palpatine ordered the termination of the Zillo Beast for purposes of scientific research.]]
During the [[Battle of Malastare]], the [[Zillo Beast]] was inadvertently awakened and Palpatine wanted the creature killed, but changed his mind when [[Doctor]] [[Sionver Boll]] and Skywalker pointed out the beast's indestructible hide could prove fruitful if analyzed. The Zillo Beast was instead rendered unconscious, and transported to Coruscant. It broke out of its restraints and [[Zillo Beast incident|rampaged]] through the [[Federal District|Senate District]] before being killed with [[poison]] gas. Palpatine ordered Boll to clone the animal.<ref name="The Zillo Beast">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast}}</ref><ref name="The Zillo Beast Strikes Back">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast Strikes Back}}</ref>

During the [[Senate hostage crisis]], Cad Bane demanded Ziro the Hutt be released from [[Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center|prison]] in exchange for the hostages' release. Palpatine reluctantly complied after Skywalker was subdued by [[Cad Bane's group|Bane's gang]].<ref name="Hostage Crisis">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref>

The following year,<ref name="Canon dates1">{{TCWcanondates|312}}</ref> while the Senate was considering [[Republic financial reform bill|deregulating]] the banks to increase funding for the war. Palpatine was soon informed by Amidala that the [[Separatist Senate]], led by [[Mina Bonteri]], was considering [[Confederate–Republic peace initiative|peace negotiations]]. Dooku had the [[central power distribution grid]] [[Bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid|bombed]], and then staged another [[Attack on Confederate people|attack]] on the Confederacy, which killed Bonteri and was blamed on the Republic, dashing any hope of peace.<ref name="Heroes on Both Sides">{{TCW|Heroes on Both Sides}}</ref>

[[File:Palpatine_Pursuite_of_Peace.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Palpatine reflected on Amidala's speech against the escalation of the Clone Wars, noting her ability to sway public opinion.]]
Desperate, Amidala attempted to rally support for opposing a new [[Republic military enhancement bill|bill]] but found few willing to do so. Upon further investigation, Amidala found that many of the senators who voted in support have actually been blackmailed to do so. She also discovered that supporting the bill would mean bankrupting certain segments of the Republic such as their social programs, due to the Banking Clan's high interest rates. Pursued by assassins, Bail Organa, Onacondo Farr and Amidala continued attempting to oppose the bill with Amidala stepping up in front of the Senate. In her speech, she pointed out that passing the bill would harm the citizens it was supposedly attempting to protect. Her speech marshals loud respect and support from the Senate audience. Later, Palpatine expressed his displeasure to Mas Amedda, noting how the success of one individual's passionate voice can have over his power. Palpatine resolved to wait until fate and the Senate once more turn to favor him.<ref name="Pursuit of Peace">{{TCW|Pursuit of Peace}}</ref>

[[File:FarrFuneral.png|thumb|250px|Palpatine attended the funeral of Senator Onaconda Farr, whose murder undermined Amidala's plans for a peaceful resolution of the Clone Wars.]]
When the military enhancement bill for more clone troopers was introduced, Palpatine claimed to be opposed to it. The bill encountered [[Reduced military spending bill|minor but effective resistance]], although one of its greatest critics, [[Onaconda Farr]], seemingly died of a heart failure before it could be voted on. Palpatine attended the [[Funeral of Onaconda Farr|funeral]], but, in the Chancellor's office, he and others met with [[inspector]] [[Tanivos Exantor Divo]], who revealed a poison had actually killed the senator. As the inspector left, the Chancellor claimed that murder in the Senate was unthinkable. Later, Palpatine and the others reunited in his office, where Divo nearly arrested the false suspect, the Kaminoan Senator [[Halle Burtoni]]. However, Amidala realized Farr's aide, [[Lolo Purs]], was the true culprit, and the Rodian was arrested. Soon afterward, the military enhancement bill was passed; Palpatine claimed to a disappointed Amidala that he too was disappointed, but that democracy needed to be respected, and stated that, with more troops, the war could possibly end more quickly.<ref name="Senate Murders" />

Two years after the mission to Thule, Palpatine expressed his faith in the disgraced Jedi Knight Iskat Akaris to Master Yoda. This support, in tandem with that of Masters [[Klefan Opus]] and [[Uumay Hawlatha]], proved enough to forestall Yoda's reservations as he and fellow Councilor Mace Windu decided in favor of putting Akaris back in the field.<ref name="Inquisitor: Rise of the Red Blade" />

During the [[Battle of Sullust]], Sidious felt Asajj Ventress growing stronger in the ways of the dark side of the Force. Through a hologram, Darth Sidious accused Tyranus of wanting to overthrow him as Dark Lord which shocked his apprentice who stated his loyalty belonged only to his Master. Sidious then demanded proof and ordered him to eliminate Ventress which the Count sadly obliged to. After assuming success in the death of his former disciple, Dooku contacted Sidious of his apparent success. Satisfied, Darth Sidious praised his apprentice for once again proving his loyalty. The two were unaware that Ventress survived.<ref name="Nightsisters">{{TCW|Nightsisters (episode)}}</ref>

Sidious ordered Tyranus to ally with the resurgent [[Zygerrian Slave Empire]], explaining past Sith Empires were built on the backs of slaves and theirs would be no exception.<ref name="Escape from Kadavo">{{TCW|Escape from Kadavo}}</ref> They soon plotted for bounty hunters such as Cad Bane and [[Rako Hardeen]] to "kidnap" Palpatine during the [[Festival of Light]] on Naboo. Kenobi infiltrated the plot and helped the Jedi to prevent it, lulling them into a false sense of security. Dooku showed up the evening after the festival but was [[Plan to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine|defeated]] and forced to flee.<ref name="Crisis on Naboo">{{TCW|Crisis on Naboo}}</ref>

====Late campaigns====

=====Return of Darth Maul=====
{{Quote|Have mercy. Please. Please!''"<br />"''There ''is'' no mercy.|Maul and Darth Sidious|<ref name="The Lawless">{{TCW|The Lawless}}</ref>}}
[[File:PalpatineSensesMaul-TL.png|thumb|left|250px|Sensing a disturbance in the Force, Sidious traveled to Mandalore to confront Maul, his first apprentice.]]
The next year,<ref name="Canon dates2">{{TCWcanondates|421}}</ref> Maul returned to the galaxy after a decade of hiding, with his brother [[Savage Opress]] now acting as his apprentice. The Jedi were concerned but Palpatine disagreed, convincing Yoda that the Separatists should be their concern and that Maul's vendetta was a private matter for Kenobi to resolve.<ref name="Revival">{{TCW|Revival (episode)}}</ref> When Maul [[Takeover of Mandalore|seized]] control of [[Mandalore]], the most powerful planet in the [[Council of Neutral Systems]], Sidious realized that Maul had grown too dangerous and was a threat to his future conquest of the galaxy. Deciding to end the threat personally, Sidious had his [[Darth Sidious' Eta-class shuttle|shuttle]] flown to [[Sundari]], where he confronted Maul and Opress.<ref name="The Lawless" />

[[File:SidiousVsNightbrothers-TL.png|thumb|250px|Sidious defeated Maul and killed Savage Opress, putting an end to their challenge to the reigning Sith Lords.]]
Not fooled by Maul's attempts to become his apprentice once again, Sidious [[Battle of Mandalore|engaged]] the rival Sith Lords in combat. Sidious proved himself to be not only a match for their combined strength but also superior, as after a prolonged duel, he separated the brothers by first bypassing Savage's defense and knocking him away with a kick and then force-pushed Maul, briefly knocking him out. Sidious then briefly toyed with Savage, not even bothering to engage, before he then began battling him again and soundly slayed Opress in single combat. Not bothering to prevent Maul from going to his brother, knowing it was too late for him to do anything to save Savage after Opress finally succumbed, Sidious taunted Maul again, reminding him of the ancient rules of the Sith and how Maul had been replaced before he then once again engaged his former apprentice. Although Sidious found Maul to be far more ferocious than Savage, he ultimately won the final blade lock and brought Maul to his knees, but chose not to kill him, foreseeing that his fallen apprentice could be useful to him in the near future.<ref name="The Lawless" />

=====Trial of Ahsoka Tano=====
{{Quote|I'm sure many of you look at this former Jedi and think, 'Surely she cannot be this murderer or saboteur that they speak of.' And yet think of all the times we have been fooled by the Separatists and how they have infiltrated the Republic, and ask yourself, 'Is this yet another Separatist scheme?'

[[File:PalpatineRedGuard-TWJ.png|thumb|left|250px|Palpatine presided over the trial of Ahsoka Tano, a Jedi framed for treason.]]
Chancellor Palpatine served as the judge of the [[trial of Ahsoka Tano]], who was accused of masterminding a [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|bombing]] at the Jedi Temple. Flanked by two crimson-robed guards, he listened while Senator Amidala and Admiral Tarkin made their arguments as the defense and the prosecutor, respectively. When they had finished, the Chancellor delivered a speech warning the court to beware of Separatist schemes that aimed to undermine the Jedi Order, and by extension, the Galactic Republic, from within. Before he could announce the verdict, however, Skywalker interrupted with [[Barriss Offee]], who confessed to the crime. Palpatine ordered Offee taken away, and Tano was acquitted.<ref name="The Wrong Jedi" /> The ordeal left Tano disillusioned and she refused an offer to rejoin the Jedi Order.

=====Manipulating two sides=====
{{Quote|Each day, we grow closer and closer to victory.|Sheev Palpatine|<ref name="Orders">{{TCW|Orders (episode)}}</ref>}}
[[File:Informing_Palpatine_of_Tups_death.png|thumb|250px|Faced with a conspiracy involving the clone army, Palpatine ordered that the evidence be brought to him on Coruscant.]]
During the [[Battle of Ringo Vinda]], the clone trooper [[Tup|CT-5385]] "Tup" suddenly faltered, becoming confused, betraying and killing the Jedi Master [[Tiplar]], before ultimately succumbing to insanity and dying himself. This incident was instigated by a faulty biochip, inserted into clones for the purpose of enforcing loyalty to the Supreme Chancellor and which laid the groundwork for their execution of Protocol 66. With his plans threatened, Sidious, as Chancellor Palpatine, had Tup's body taken to the [[Grand Republic Medical Facility]] for autopsy.<ref name="Conspiracy" /> [[Shaak Ti]] and [[Nala Se]] brought the rebellious clone [[Fives|CT-5555]] "Fives" to Palpatine, who had uncovered the inhibitor chips implanted in each clone trooper, and believed them to be part of a Separatist conspiracy. The Chancellor informed Fives of his involvement with the chips and had his guards stage an attack, making Fives look dangerous to the Republic and discrediting him. Following Fives' death, he informed the Jedi that a parasite native to Ringo Vinda was responsible for Tup and Fives's behavior, for which all of the clone troopers would be inoculated against.<ref name="Orders" /> Sidious furthered the beneficiary opportunities from this series of events as he transferred the bulk of his [[Darth Sidious' collection|Sith artifact collection]] to the Medical Facility from an abandoned store-house in the Works district, where the elusive Sith feared the Jedi may discover.<ref name="CL2016" />

During a [[Mission to Scipio|diplomatic mission]] to [[Scipio]], Senator Padmé Amidala learned from [[Rush Clovis]] that the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan]] had gone bankrupt. Palpatine told her to trust Clovis while hiring the bounty hunter [[Embo]] to target them on the Clan's apparent behalf.<ref name="An Old Friend">{{TCW|An Old Friend}}</ref> Sidious and Tyranus agreed to make Clovis the new head of the Banking Clan: the [[Muun]] government arrested the [[Core Five]], and Clovis was elected by a Senate majority to replace them.<ref name="The Rise of Clovis">{{TCW|The Rise of Clovis}}</ref> Dooku blackmailed Clovis into raising the Republic's interest rates and sent a fleet to blockade Scipio, to which Palpatine responded by sending a fleet commanded by Skywalker. As Scipio fell under the Republic's control and Clovis committed [[Death|suicide]], the Muuns ceded control of the banks to the [[Office of the Chancellor]].<ref name="Crisis at the Heart">{{TCW|Crisis at the Heart}}</ref>

When Queen [[Julia]] of [[Bardotta]] requested assistance from the Senate regarding the disappearance of several [[Dagoyan Order|Dagoyan Masters]], Palpatine offered to send [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] and Senator Amidala, but she insisted the aid of Representative Binks. Palpatine informed the Jedi Council, who deemed it unwise, so Master Windu volunteered to accompany him.<ref name="The Disappeared, Part I" />

=====Sifo-Dyas' secret=====
{{Quote|Master Sifo-Dyas? Forgive me. I'm afraid I am not familiar with that name.|Sheev Palpatine, to Yoda|<ref name="TLO" />}}
[[File:Sid_puts_the_squeeze_on_Tyranus.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious ordered Tyranus to prevent the Jedi from discovering the Sith's plans.]]
Palpatine was visited by Yoda when the Jedi discovered [[Sifo-Dyas's lightsaber]] at the location of a distress beacon: apparently, Sifo-Dyas had died on a mission to [[Felucia]], but details were sealed by the Office of the Chancellor. Palpatine told Yoda to consult former Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, since he was still a Senator at the time. Sidious then went to berate Tyranus via hologram over this loose end, ordering him to sort it out. Vexed by Tyranus' carelessness, Sidious Force choked his apprentice, warning him to remember the price for failure. Dooku prevented Kenobi and Skywalker from learning who killed Sifo-Dyas, but they still deduced the Sith were responsible for the creation of the clone army.<ref name="TLO" />

=====Yoda's journey to Moraband=====
{{Quote|Save him, Jedi? Can you save him? Why not let him go? Let him die, and you can stop all that I will do.|Darth Sidious, to Yoda, about Anakin Skywalker|<ref name="Sacrifice" />}}
[[File:Dark_side_ritual.png|thumb|250px|Sidious and Tyranus used Sith sorcery while attempting to undermine the resolve of Grand Master Yoda.]]
When Yoda entered the [[Valley of the Dark Lords]] on [[Moraband]] during a quest to uncover [[Force spirit|immortality]], Sidious and Tyranus sensed his presence and convened at the Works on Coruscant. Greeting his apprentice once he arrived, Sidious led Tyranus to the tower's ceremonial chamber. Exploiting Tyranus and Yoda's Force-bond, Sidious used a [[Balc]] incantation to cast a [[dark illusion]] to ensnare the Jedi Master. Using Sifo-Dyas' visage, he offered to reveal his identity if he would join him, but Yoda refused. The illusion then made it seem that they were in the Works pursuing the Sith Lords with Anakin Skywalker and the [[501st Legion]]. Sidious dueled Yoda on the catwalks outside the tower, with Skywalker arriving outside shortly after. Sidious rendered Skywalker unconscious with [[Force lightning]] while he continued fighting Yoda. As the illusion unfolded, Yoda refused to sacrifice Skywalker to pursue Sidious, and instead demonstrated he was willing to sacrifice himself to save the Chosen One. Sidious' illusion faltered: the Jedi Master won. Defeated, Sidious stated that they would need more time to defeat the Jedi.<ref name="Sacrifice" />

=====Business on Utapau=====
When he learned the otherwise unremarkable planet [[Utapau]] had produced a massive [[kyber crystal]], the world became of interest to Sidious, as he wanted the large crystal for his battle station project.<ref name="Helmet Collection 35">{{HelmetCollectionCite|35|Highlights of the Saga}}</ref> With the crystal in the hands of a [[Sugi]] [[Endente's arms dealing group|arms dealing group]], Dooku agreed to a sale, claiming he wanted the crystal for the Separatist Alliance.<ref name="In Search of the Crystal">{{TCW|In Search of the Crystal}}</ref> Grievous himself arrived to oversee the deal, ultimately killing the Sugi leader, [[Endente]], and taking the crystal to his Separatist fleet.<ref name="Crisis">{{TCW|Crystal Crisis}}</ref> However, after they had [[Mission to Utapau|arrived on Utapau]] to investigate the death of Jedi Master [[Tu-Anh]],<ref name="A Death on Utapau">{{TCW|A Death on Utapau}}</ref> Kenobi and Skywalker fought to stop the Separatist operation, pursuing the crystal into space and destroying it aboard Grievous's [[Dual Hemisphere-Omni Support Vessel]]. Nevertheless, Yoda feared that Sidious was planning to create a superweapon,<ref name="The Big Bang">{{TCW|The Big Bang}}</ref> and Sidious remained interested in Utapau.

=====Battle with Maul and Talzin=====
{{Quote|At last. The great deceiver comes to rescue his pawn.''"<br />"''I come to end this farce once and for all.|Maul and Darth Sidious|<ref name="SonOfDathomir4" />}}
[[File:SWDarthMaulDathomir-4.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sidious secured his plan for the galaxy by defeating his rivals Maul and Mother Talzin.]]
Meanwhile, Sidious wanted to use Maul to draw out Mother Talzin, the Nightsister witch who could pose a threat to his plans. His [[Campaign against the Shadow Collective|operations against Talzin]] began when [[Mandalorian super commando]]s broke Maul out of his im[[prison]]ment in the [[Spire (Stygeon Prime)|Spire]] on [[Stygeon Prime]].<ref name="SonOfDathomir1">[[Darth Maul — Son of Dathomir 1|''Darth Maul — Son of Dathomir'' 1]]</ref> Maul called on Mother Talzin for help after [[General]] Grievous [[Battle of Zanbar|defeated]] his forces at [[Zanbar]], precisely what Sidious and Dooku wanted. Talzin foresaw this and ordered her son to draw the Separatists to [[Ord Mantell]], where he defeated and captured Dooku.<ref name="SonOfDathomir2">[[Darth Maul — Son of Dathomir 2|''Darth Maul — Son of Dathomir'' 2]]</ref> Maul contacted Sidious and informed him of their capture: the Sith Lord responded he should execute them, saying there were of no more use to him. Maul informed Dooku, goading him into allying with him.<ref name="SonOfDathomir3" />

Maul and Dooku flew to Dathomir, where Talzin intended to siphon Dooku's lifeforce to regain her physical body. Sidious and Grievous also arrived on the planet and [[Second Battle of Dathomir|attacked]] Maul and the Talzin-possessed Dooku. Talzin regained her physical body and fended off Sidious' lightning, sacrificing herself to allow her son to escape. Taking the opportunity, Grievous plunged two [[lightsaber]]s into her body, eliminating the foe of Sidious. Despite Maul's escape, Sidious was satisfied that the [[Shadow Collective]] had been destroyed.<ref name="SonOfDathomir4" />

=====A Jedi renegade=====
{{Quote|Darth Tyranus found his final apprentice in the unconventional Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos.|Darth Sidious|<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" />}}
Later, the Jedi sent [[Quinlan Vos]] to work with Ventress to kill Count Dooku. This mission was deemed Jedi business, so Palpatine was not informed. However, Skywalker was unsure if that was the correct decision, and he felt that the Jedi keeping secrets from the Chancellor was wrong. Eventually, aboard the Republic's [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Vigilance (Venator-class)|''Vigilance'']] in [[orbit]] of [[Christophsis]], Vos, who had fallen to the dark side and tasked himself with becoming Dooku's apprentice so as to discover Darth Sidious' identity, and Dooku, held in captivity of several clone troopers and Jedi, including Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, had enlisted the assistance of Asajj Ventress in their escape.<ref name="Dark Disciple">''[[Dark Disciple]]''</ref>

The trio, however, crash-landed onto Christophsis under Republic pursuit, with the Count of Serenno suffering grievous injuries. Having sought shelter in a hidden Confederacy fortress, Tyranus contacted a long-awaiting Darth Sidious within a hologram communications chamber in seek of help, yet not before Vos and Ventress slipped in. Tyranus was thus forced to introduce Quinlan Vos, presenting the former Jedi as his "new assassin" to Sidious, who had customarily hidden his facial features behind his dark cowl, whilst Ventress remained hidden in the shadows. After expressing disapproval with his apprentice's new employ, Darth Sidious listened to Tyranus' plea for an evacuation ship as a [[second battle of Christophsis]] ensued with Skywalker leading the ruthless Republic onslaught. Giving only a vague answer, Sidious ended the holo-communication as the [[Christophsis Separatist tower]] fell to Republic gunship fire. The battle resulted in an inevitable Separatist loss, and with Ventress' redemption through<ref name="Dark Disciple" /> appearing to<ref name="TBB article">{{SW|url=news/the-bad-batch-season-3-trailer|text=Watch the ''Star Wars: The Bad Batch'' Season 3 Trailer}}</ref> sacrificing herself for her lover, Quinlan Vos, Tyranus' "new assassin" chose to allow Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi take him back to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant for reassessment. Meanwhile, as the Jedi took Vos, a ship sent by Darth Sidious arrived to retrieve Tyranus, letting the Separatist leader return to safety.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Under the Sector Governance Decree, Palpatine created a new structure of regional governance<ref name="The Rebel Files" /> by appointing certain individuals as governors. In theory, the decree was designed to shore up the war effort by uniting star systems into singular blocs and transforming their production centers into war-focused installations.<ref name="OF84" /> In reality, however, regional governors could become leaders of the systems they oversaw, allowing Palpatine to circumvent and one day disband the Senate by creating a new bureaucracy<ref name="Episode IV">{{Film|IV}}</ref> composed of individuals he sent out.<ref name="OF84" /> The decree, however, proved to be too much for senators who formed the [[Delegation of 2,000]], which quietly assembled the [[Petition of 2,000]]<ref name="CotR" /> in the name of protesting Palpatine's conduct<ref name="DBMT">{{Databank|meena-tills|Meena Tills}}</ref> and growing powers.

[[File:ChancellorsEdict-SoH.png|thumb|250px|Sidious moved forward with his plans to replace Tyranus with Skywalker as the Clone Wars entered its last phase.]]
Deciding that it was time to make Skywalker his next apprentice, Sidious devised a plan for Palpatine to be captured in order for Skywalker to rescue him. The plan included sacrificing Darth Tyranus, who was to be killed by Skywalker, which would tempt Skywalker to the dark side and eventually lead to the young Jedi replacing Dooku as the Dark Lord's new apprentice.<ref name="Episode III" /> Likely through the Nexus Route,<ref name="Battles">''[[Star Wars: Battles that Changed the Galaxy]]''</ref> Sidious had obtained the coordinates to Coruscant<ref name="Emperor Palpatine" /> and gave them to Grievous and his fleet to jump from the Outer Rim directly to Coruscant.<ref name="The Separatists">{{EncyclopediaCite|The Separatists}}</ref> Sidious also had a plan to kidnap the Supreme Chancellor,<ref name="Emperor Palpatine" /> which was tasked to Grievous. Sidious ordered Grievous to capture Palpatine and for Dooku to hold him hostage. Grievous and Dooku, however, were unaware of Sidious' true intentions.<ref name="Episode III" />

During the [[Outer Rim Sieges]], Grievous commanded a [[Battle of Coruscant|massive invasion]] of Coruscant, accompanied by Dooku.<ref name="Lightsabers">''[[Star Wars Lightsabers: A Guide to Weapons of the Force]]''</ref> Dooku, who had earlier relocated his command post to Grievous's [[flagship]], the ''[[Invisible Hand]]'', stayed close to Grievous to ensure he was carrying out his orders; even though the cyborg general posed no threat to Sidious, he did not want any setback to his plans.<ref name="Emperor Palpatine" /> While the Republic and Separatist fleets clashed above the planet, Grievous went to the ground in order to capture Palpatine, Shaak Ti and [[Roron Corobb]], along with a clone task force were sent to protect him. Corrob and the clones fell to Grievous, while Ti managed to fight further. Grievous took the upper hand by electrifying the Jedi Master with cables, knocking her unconscious in the process. Grievous took [[Shaak Ti's lightsaber|her lightsaber]] and fled with the captive Palpatine to the Separatist flagship ''Invisible Hand''.<ref name="Lightsabers" />

[[File:DeathOfTyranus.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker executed Tyranus on the orders of Chancellor Palpatine during the Battle of Coruscant.]]
Kenobi and Skywalker, who at the time were in the middle of [[Siege of Mandalore|making preparations to take]] Mandalore, were called upon to rescue him.<ref name="Ahsoka">[[Ahsoka (novel)|''Ahsoka'']]</ref><ref name="OFNF">{{TCW|Old Friends Not Forgotten}}</ref> After landing in the ''Invisible Hand''{{'s}} hangar, the two found Palpatine bound to a chair on the [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]]. They were confronted by Dooku, who they entered a duel with. Dooku took out Kenobi with ease and then focused on Skywalker. They continued the duel until Skywalker cut off his hands. Disarmed and on his knees, Dooku was bested. Palpatine commended Skywalker on his accomplishment. However, he then betrayed Dooku by urging Anakin to kill him, due to Dooku having served his purpose. A horrified Dooku looked to Palpatine pleadingly, only to be met with another, more sinister urging. With one swift move, Count Dooku was beheaded. Anakin was conflicted on his actions but was comforted by Palpatine, who told him that it was a simple act of revenge in return for Dooku cutting off his arm. Beyond luring Skywalker closer to the dark side,<ref name="Episode III" /> the act also served to tie up the loose end Dooku would be if he lived, robbing the Jedi of the chance to question him to learn more about Sidious.<ref name="The Phantom Apprentice">{{TCW|The Phantom Apprentice}}</ref>

Skywalker went to pick up the unconscious Kenobi, to which Palpatine pleaded with the Jedi to leave his master. His plea was denied, and the three began their descent to the hangar. Meanwhile, the ''Invisible Hand'' was attacked by the [[Guarlara (Venator-class)|''Guarlara'']], with the former taking extensive damage and losing its position, momentarily falling towards that planet's surface. With the ship on its side, the three began running down an elevator shaft, only to lose their footing as the ''Invisible Hand'' regained its position. They managed to get out and to a hallway, where they were then captured in a ray shield. They were brought before Grievous in the control room, where R2-D2, who was also a captive, gave a distraction that allowed Kenobi and Skywalker to take control. With nowhere to run, Grievous broke open a window and found his way to the escape pods, which he activated as he fled. The ship then became caught in Coruscant's gravity well and began barreling towards the surface. Skywalker and Kenobi attempted to land it, but only managed to ease the crash. Following the crash, Palpatine and the Jedi were escorted to the Senate Building.<ref name="Episode III" />

====The seduction of Anakin Skywalker====
{{Quote|Soon I will have a ''new'' apprentice, one far younger and more powerful.|Darth Sidious, to Grievous|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
[[File:Palp_trustme.jpg|thumb|250px|With the death of Tyranus, Sidious anticipated Skywalker's imminent conversion to the dark side and the ways of the Sith.]]
Sidious directed Grievous to return to Utapau on the pretense<ref name="HC 24">[[Star Wars Helmet Collection 24|''Star Wars Helmet Collection'': MagnaGuard]]</ref> of ensuring the safety of the increasingly irrelevant Separatist Council.<ref name="The Separatists" /> In reality, he had other intentions for the general,<ref name="HC 24" /> whose usefulness to Sidious had come to its end.<ref name="HC 21">[[Star Wars Helmet Collection 21|''Star Wars Helmet Collection'': Kylo Ren]]</ref> Unaware he was being set up again,<ref name="The Separatists" /> Grievous&mdash;whose campaigns had served to distract the Jedi Order from the Sith conspiracy unfolding around them on Coruscant<ref name="The Dark Side" />&mdash;had only one role left to play: he had to serve as bait to lure Kenobi away from Coruscant and Skywalker. Sidious did not care if Grievous or Kenobi lived or died, as his plan was ready to bring down the Republic and the Jedi<ref name="HC 24" /> and seduce Skywalker to the dark side.<ref name="Episode III" />

Sidious soon began preparing for the war's end. Sidious instructed Grievous to move the Separatists to Mustafar.<ref name="Episode III" /> He also told him to remain on Utapau until his new apprentice had joined their cause since he did not want to waste any time before finding a replacement.<ref name="Cyborg and Jedi">{{StoryCite|story=The Cyborg and the Jedi|book=The Prequel Trilogy Stories}}</ref> Skywalker, who had just been hailed as a hero for killing Count Dooku and rescuing the Chancellor, began having visions of his wife dying in childbirth. Sidious decided to use that to his advantage. Throughout the next few rotations, their relationship kept growing. Ultimately, Palpatine appointed Skywalker to be his representative to the Jedi Council.<ref name="Episode III" /> During what ended up becoming the last full session of the Republic Senate, the Petition of 2,000 was officially unveiled.<ref name="The Rebel Files" /> However, Palpatine still managed to find an advantage in the current political atmosphere, telling and convincing Skywalker that Amidala could have ulterior motives she was keeping secret from them both.<ref name="The Long Game">{{InsiderCite|188|The Long Game: The Insidious Plot of Sheev Palpatine}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the Jedi began to distrust and resent the Chancellor's accumulating power and control. The Council, who was not happy with Skywalker's appointment by one not of their order, denied him the rank of "Jedi Master." This turn of events simply furthered Sidious' plans. The Council, however, decided to use this appointment as a chance to spy on Palpatine. Skywalker, who felt insulted by that demand, regretfully agreed and began to devote his time to getting to know the Chancellor better. Some Jedi, such as Mace Windu, were concerned about their relationship, seeing that it could be dangerous putting the two together. Windu ultimately noted that the dark side of the Force surrounded the Chancellor.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:Tragedy.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sidious recounted the history of his late master as a Sith legend, leading Skywalker to drift ever closer to the dark side of the Force.]]
At an opera show, Palpatine and Skywalker discussed the situation with Palpatine revealing to know that the Council wanted Skywalker to spy on him. At the same time, Skywalker, who was dealing with the fear of his wife's loss was beginning to distrust the Jedi Council. This allowed Sidious to orchestrate Skywalker's downfall; he claimed that the Jedi and the Sith were alike in nearly every way,<ref name="Episode III" /> setting the stage for the young Jedi to switch sides while playing to his devotion to the Jedi ideology.<ref name="Certain POV 193">{{InsiderCite|193|A Certain Point of View|A Certain Point of View: Trust, Truth, and Little White Lies}}</ref> Next, Palpatine told him the story of his master, "Darth Plagueis the Wise." According to the story, Plagueis possessed such strength in the Force that he could use it to prevent the ones closest to him from dying. Skywalker asked what happened to him, to which Palpatine said that he was afraid of losing his power, but had taught his apprentice everything, and then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Skywalker, enthralled by the story, wished to know more about this power, asking him if he himself could learn it with Palpatine stating that, though possible, such things could not be taught by members of the Order.<ref name="Episode III" /> Skywalker, however, was unaware that Palpatine was really talking about how he killed his mentor Plagueis, in order to lure him to the dark side.

As the situation grew worse, Skywalker went to speak with the Chancellor regarding the [[Battle of Utapau]]. Anakin expressed his disappointment that he was not chosen for the assignment. Palpatine told Skywalker that the Council did not trust him and that the Jedi Council were plotting to take control of the Republic. He then revealed that he was trained in the ways of the Force, "even the nature of the dark side," the power that could save his wife Amidala from certain death. This led to Skywalker concluding that Palpatine himself was the Sith Lord the Jedi were hunting down and drawing his lightsaber. Although Skywalker considered killing Palpatine, the young Jedi was deeply conflicted realizing that he could not lose the Sith Lord as he thought he needed to learn the dark side power to "save" his wife. Stunned by the revelation, Skywalker responded by reporting Palpatine to the Jedi and went to the Jedi Council with this information.<ref name="Episode III" />

====The fate of the galaxy====
{{Quote|In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.''"<br />"''Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?''"<br />"''The Senate will decide your fate.''"<br />"''I ''am'' the Senate.''"<br />"''Not yet.|Mace Windu and Darth Sidious|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
[[File:Vaapad.png|thumb|250px|The fate of the galaxy was decided in the battle between the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and Jedi Master Mace Windu.]]
Mace Windu, realizing that the Jedi had been deceived by Sidious, after learning about the Chancellor's double identity from Skywalker, went to [[Duel in Palpatine's office|confront]] the Chancellor along with fellow Jedi Council Masters [[Kit Fisto]], [[Agen Kolar]], as well as [[Saesee Tiin]]. Windu and the three other Jedi boldly ignited their lightsabers and declared that he was under arrest. Igniting his own crimson lightsaber, Sidious declared the four Jedi as [[Treason|traitors]] to the Republic. Letting out an inhuman wail of fury, he then lunged forward and slew Kolar and Tiin in mere [[second]]s, and Fisto slightly later, leaving Windu to face the Dark Lord alone. Sidious and Windu then engaged in a ferocious one-on-one duel. While the fight appeared to be even, Windu eventually disarmed him, knocked him to the floor and held him at blade point.<ref name="Episode III" />

Skywalker soon arrived after this and both sides tried to persuade him that the other was a traitor. Windu taunted Sidious in his defeat which prompted the Sith Lord to attempt to kill Windu with Force lightning, but Windu managed to deflect it back at Sidious, causing the Sith Lord's face to take on a hideously disfigured appearance in the process, due to the dark side energy emanating from the lightning. As a result of this, Sidious then switched his strategy to pretending to be a defenseless old man, dropping his lightning attack and proclaiming that he was too weak to carry on. Skywalker told Windu that Sidious had to stand trial, though Windu claimed that Sidious possessed far too much influence to be left alive, as he controlled both the courts and the senate. Deciding that his wife's survival was more important than his loyalty to the Jedi Order, Skywalker betrayed Windu by cutting off his lightsaber hand, giving Sidious the opening to drop his feigned weakness and throw Windu out the office window with a full barrage of Force lightning.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:SithTeachings-Convergence.png|thumb|left|250px|Darth Sidious bestowed the name Darth Vader on his new apprentice.]]
Skywalker, although initially stunned by what he had done, ultimately viewed Windu's transgressions as the final act of Jedi hypocrisy that he would not tolerate, and knelt before the now-scarred Chancellor, agreeing to join the dark side on the condition that he was be shown how to save Amidala's life, thus betraying the Jedi. Sidious bestowed on the young man the Sith name of Darth Vader, promising the young apprentice that together they would discover the hidden art of preventing death.<ref name="Episode III" /> That Sidious was now claiming he did not know how to cheat death, when prior he had suggested he already knew the secret, was overlooked by Vader; by telling Vader that Amidala could be saved, Sidious had told Vader what he wanted to hear and, thus, had groomed his apprentice to overlook the contradiction.<ref name="Certain POV 193" /> Sidious informed Vader of his intention to purge the galaxy of all Jedi, claiming that the Order was a threat to the Senate as well as the security of the Republic. Sidious ordered Vader to [[Operation: Knightfall|attack the Jedi Temple]] on Coruscant, and then [[Mission to Mustafar|execute]] the [[Executive Separatist Council|Separatist leaders]] on Mustafar. He declared that the galaxy would then return to a state of peace under the rule of the Sith.<ref name="Episode III" />

====Execute Order 66====
{{Quote|Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order 66.''"<br />"''Yes, my Lord.|Darth Sidious and [[Cody]]|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
[[File:Execute_Order_66.png|thumb|250px|Sidious ordered the Grand Army to execute Order 66, declaring every Jedi an enemy of the Republic.]]
While Vader led the 501st Legion's attack on the Jedi Temple, Sidious ordered the rest of the clone troopers to execute Order 66, declaring every Jedi an enemy of the Republic.<ref name="Episode III" /> However, to the select few of the Jedi he had secretly groomed, he offered their lives in exchange for service to him.<ref name="Inquisitor: Rise of the Red Blade" /> Order 66 activated the biochips within the clones, who were programmed to kill the Jedi for treason against the state.<ref name="Clone troopers DB">{{Databank|clone-troopers|Clone Troopers}}</ref> Despite serving and forming deep relationships with the Jedi,<ref name="TSWB" /> the activation of their biochips by Sidious, immediately and forcibly brainwashed them into believing that the Jedi were traitors to the Republic that needed to be executed,<ref name="Shattered">{{TCW|Shattered}}</ref> resulting in the start of the [[Great Jedi Purge]]. The Jedi were consequently betrayed and gunned down by their soldiers, although some managed to survive such as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda,<ref name="Episode III" /> and [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]].<ref name="AND">[[A New Dawn (novel)|''A New Dawn'']]</ref> Sidious also used Order 66 to compel [[Clone Commander]] [[Rex]] to eliminate the former Jedi Ahsoka Tano, along with his former apprentice Maul who had been captured and brought to Coruscant by the 501st Legion. However, both attempts were unsuccessful as Tano freed Maul, and then subsequently freed Rex of the mind control by removing his biochip.<ref name="Shattered" />

===Age of the Empire===
====Rise of the New Order====

=====Consolidation of power=====
{{Quote|In order to ensure the security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire! For a safe and secure society!|Darth Sidious|audio=Palpatine-Proclamation.flac|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
After the Jedi Temple fell,<ref name="Episode III" /> Sidious arrived within and congratulated his new apprentice after affirming he had done as commanded;<ref name="Vader 2020 7">[[Darth Vader (2020) 7|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 7]]</ref> Vader had killed many Jedi during the siege, including Padawans and younglings,<ref name="Episode III" /> much to Sidious' delight.<ref name="Vader 2020 7" /> After assuring Vader he had done well, Sidious ordered his apprentice to bring peace to their newly rising empire, dispatching him to Mustafar to wipe out the Separatist leaders. Their conversation was captured by the Temple's security holograms. Sidious then contacted the Separatist Council to inform them that Vader would arrive and take care of them, although none of them were aware that Sidious had actually betrayed them and had sent Vader to kill them.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:Declaration.png|thumb|left|250px|Darth Sidious began his reign as the Emperor when he officially reformed the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire.]]
Assembling the Senate in [[Special session of Congress|special session]], Sidious, as Palpatine, addressed the Republic and accused the Jedi of attempting to assassinate him and overthrow the government, using his newly scarred face as evidence. Affirming that the Jedi rebellion, as he called it, had been shut down,<ref name="Episode III" /> by the loyal Clone Army,<ref name="Vader 2017 16">[[Darth Vader (2017) 16|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 16]]</ref> Palpatine assured the Senate any remaining Jedi would be found and wiped away.<ref name="Episode III" /> Taking advantage of the fear and death he had spread across the galaxy<ref name="RiseFall" /> and presenting himself as the man who had ended the war<ref name="MoF" /> and the supposed Jedi rebellion it had been building to,<ref name="Dark Lord 1">[[Darth Vader (2017) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 1]]</ref> he [[Proclamation of the New Order|announced]] the Republic's reorganization into the First Galactic Empire,<ref name="Episode III" /> promising a destructive conflict would never again be unleashed under its watch.<ref name="SWP">''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]''</ref> In the process, he declared himself [[Monarchy|Emperor]] of the new regime, with little if any resistance from the majority of the senators present.<ref name="Episode III" />

=====Battle in the Senate Chamber=====
{{Quote|I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend.|Darth Sidious, to Yoda|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
[[File:Clash_of_Titans.png|thumb|250px|Grand Master Yoda confronted Darth Sidious in a final effort to prevent the return of the Sith to galactic dominance.]]
With Kenobi and Yoda realizing what had happened upon witnessing a recording within the Jedi Temple, Yoda [[Duel in the Galactic Senate|went to face]] the Emperor personally, while a reluctant Obi-Wan stowed away onboard Amidala's [[J-type Naboo star skiff|yacht]], en route to Mustafar [[Duel on Mustafar|to kill]] Vader. Upon arriving at the [[Chancellor's working office|working office]] of the [[Chancellery Secretariat]], Yoda disposed of the pair of guardsmen by the entryway, surprising Sidious. Within moments, however, the Sith Lord had recollected himself, unleashing a barrage of Force lightning at the Jedi Master after a brief exchange of acknowledgement between the two. Yoda quickly recovered and Force pushed Sidious backwards. Yoda then engaged him in a duel when he refused to allow Sidious to escape. Sidious declared that Vader would become more powerful than both of them, while Yoda told Sidious that his faith in his nascent apprentice was a mistake, along with his faith in the dark side.<ref name="Episode III" />

The two then dueled in the Senate hall. No longer having his lightsaber shortly after, Sidious utilized the use of his Force powers by sending numerous Senate pods at the Jedi Master, which he closely dodged. Yoda eventually managed to redirect one of Sidious' pods at him, which the Sith Lord dodged. Sidious then unleashed a torrent of Force lightning at Yoda, which he was able to redirect back on him, giving the Jedi master the upper hand. However, the buildup of energy led to an explosion that caused Sidious to fall back and Yoda to take a huge fall to the ground. Luckily, Sidious managed to hang on to the pod and climb back up. While neither conquered the other, Yoda believed he had lost since he was unable to stop Sidious; the Jedi Master opted to flee, deciding to go into exile.<ref name="Episode III" />

=====Rescuing Vader=====
{{Quote|I sense Lord Vader is in danger.|Darth Sidious|<ref name="Episode III" />}}
As [[Imperial shock trooper]]s of the [[Coruscant Guard]] arrived in the Senate Chamber following the battle, the Emperor stood with Mas Amedda on a Senatorial pod as they searched for the Jedi Master. However, they could not find any trace of a body. The Emperor had more pressing concerns however: he had sensed that Vader, far away on Mustafar, was in danger of being destroyed. He ordered the clones to double their search for Yoda, and that his shuttle be prepared to depart.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:Let_The_Hate_Flow_AtG.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious traveled to Mustafar to retrieve his new apprentice, Darth Vader, who was defeated by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.]]
The Emperor made haste to Mustafar, accompanied by<ref name="Episode III" /> a [[Thire's squad|squad]] of the best shock troopers under the authority of Commander [[Thire]].<ref name="HC 38">{{HelmetCollectionCite|38|Helmets}}</ref> On planet, he found that Vader had been dismembered, horrifically burned, and left for dead by Obi-Wan Kenobi after the conclusion of their duel. He ordered the clones accompanying him to prepare a medical capsule for his apprentice. As they left to obey his instructions, the Emperor crouched beside his fallen apprentice, determined to find a way to keep him alive.<ref name="Episode III" />

The Emperor was keenly aware that, without Vader, the foundations of his newfound power would be badly shaken; he needed an apprentice capable of ensuring that his Empire would survive the inevitable challenges that would rise up against it. To make certain that Vader would be capable of remaining a powerful apprentice, the Emperor contacted the boldest scientists he could, those whose practices would have been frowned on by the Jedi and the Republic. Among these scientists was an expert in [[cybernetics]] named Doctor [[Cylo]].<ref name="Darth Vader 20">[[Darth Vader (2015) 20|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 20]]</ref>

The Emperor brought Vader to the Grand Medical Facility, far above Coruscant's surface as a storm raged across the capital. A strenuous night followed during which the scientists, their droids and their technology worked to save the critically injured Vader before he died. The new Sith apprentice was kept awake for the whole procedure, feeling the pain that came with saving his life.<ref name="Episode III" /> Cylo and the other scientists<ref name="Darth Vader 20" /> designed a suit of [[Darth Vader's armor|armor]] that would protect his weakened body and allow his scorched lungs to breathe. Cybernetic limbs were added to replace the legs and the arm that Kenobi had taken.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:VaderSidious-ROTS.jpg|thumb|250px|Returning to Coruscant, Sidious had Vader rebuilt with cybernetic and life support technology.]]
After what the Emperor would call a "long night,"<ref name="Darth Vader 20" /> Skywalker was surgically reconstructed as a cyborg and encased in the armor and mask that would forever hide away who he had once been from the galaxy. As the procedure ended and the Sith apprentice rose, the Emperor approached him. Vader's first query was to know whether or not his wife was safe. The Emperor told him that he had killed Amidala in his anger. This final loss sent Vader over the edge of pure wrath and anguish, completing his transition into the apprentice Sidious had spent decades grooming. In his rage, Vader used his new limbs to tear away the restraints that held him to the operating table and the Force to destroy the droids who had just saved his life, before stepping unsteadily onto his new legs and screaming his despair to the galaxy as a satisfied Sidious looked on with a devilish smile. Having Force choked Amidala on Mustafar,<ref name="Episode III" /> Vader remembered that he had, indeed, attacked his wife and thus believed the Emperor's claim that he had killed her.<ref name="Certain POV 193" />

Vader then turned his rage onto the Emperor, throwing him into the wall of the operating room with the Force. He angrily berated his master for promising that he could save his wife from death. The Emperor conceded that he had failed him in that regard but countered that, with her death, Amidala had given him something so much stronger: pain. This pain would fuel his power for decades and make him the dreaded Sith apprentice that Sidious had always coveted. It would also allow him to live. After a tense few moments, Vader released his master and proclaimed that he would live. Satisfied, the Emperor then assaulted Vader with Force lightning, pointing out his apprentice's lack of a lightsaber. Afterward, Sidious warned Vader never to use the Force against him in such a way again, or he would finish what Kenobi would not.<ref name="Dark Lord 1" />

Believing he had killed his wife<ref name="Certain POV 193" /> and accepting Sidious's claim that the pain it brought him was a gift that would usher in his new life,<ref name="Dark Lord 1" /> Vader invested himself entirely in Sidious, just as the Sith Lord had hoped. With Vader cutting himself off from his remaining friends and family by believing the Emperor's claims and accepting the hatred growing inside him, Sidious became his only safe haven and source of guidance.<ref name="Certain POV 193" /> Further, Sidious elected to maintain the illusion of friendship between them both for at least the time being. Meanwhile, having demonstrated his apprentice's need for a new lightsaber, Sidious showed Vader a [[Celebration marking the eradication of the Jedi Order|ceremony]] during which many of the weapons looted from the Jedi Temple were incinerated. Sidious also explained the red color of [[Sith lightsaber]]s, obtained through the process of [[bleeding]] a kyber crystal taken from a slain Jedi. He then dispatched Vader to obtain one for himself. Vader proceeded to hunt down and kill Jedi Master [[Kirak Infil'a]] on [[Al'doleem]], taking his [[Kirak Infil'a's lightsaber|lightsaber]]. At Sidious' direction, he returned to Mustafar, bleeding his new crystal there in a [[Sith cave|dark side cave]]. Sidious was in the middle of a meeting with Wilhuff Tarkin when a battle-damaged Vader returned, bursting into the room and presenting the new weapon to his master.<ref name="Dark Lord 1" /><ref name="Dark Lord 4">[[Darth Vader (2017) 4|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 4]]</ref><ref name="Dark Lord 5">[[Darth Vader (2017) 5|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 5]]</ref>

====Personal and political projects====
=====Search for ultimate power=====
{{Quote|For a Sith Lord craves absolute power, and nothing will stop me from attaining it. Not even death itself.|Darth Sidious|<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" />}}
[[File:ThrawnMeetsPalpatine-Thrawn1.png|thumb|250px|Sidious converted the Jedi Temple into the Imperial Palace, his official residence on Coruscant.|left]]
After the creation of his Sith Empire, Sidious established himself in the old Jedi Temple on Coruscant,<ref name="Tarkin" /> transforming the most famous of the Jedi Order's temples<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi">''[[Star Wars: The Secrets of the Jedi]]''</ref> into his Imperial Palace. The Jedi had built the palace atop an ancient [[Shrine in the Depths|Sith shrine]], in order to neutralize and cap the dark power that sprang from its depths. Sidious entrusted the reopening and restoration of the ancient temple to droids under the supervision of [[11-4D]], a protocol droid inherited from Darth Plagueis.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Secure in power as Emperor of the galaxy, Sidious pursued his obsession with immortality;<ref name="TSWB" /> leaving the bureaucratic work of the government to his followers, which further allowed Sidious to enjoy ruling the galaxy without concerning himself with the more boring aspects of administration,<ref name="Rewind of the Jedi">{{InsiderCite|218|Rewind of the Jedi}}</ref> he mostly withdrew from the public eye to probe the secrets of the dark side and study his Sith arcana extensively to unlock the ability to live forever. He prepared the ancient Sith world of Exegol, constructing a base of power within the [[Sith Citadel]] located on the surface, planning to claim the ancient throne of the Sith as his permanent seat of power. His loyal cult following, the [[Sith Eternal]], began to experiment with technology and genetic cloning science to expand his lifespan. Exegol was also home to his most promising experimentations within a [[vergence]] of the Force.<ref name="TSWB" />

[[File:UnlimitedPower-2020DarthVader11.png|thumb|250px|With the Empire established, Sidious concentrated on achieving his goal of immortality through the power of the dark side.]]
The planet [[Byss]] in the [[Deep Core]] was of great importance to Palpatine.<ref name="BTM 36">{{BuildFalconCite|36|Guide to the Galaxy}}</ref> Ultimately, Palpatine's true goal was for the [[Death Star]] to take over as the symbol of fear that would keep the galaxy in line, giving himself and Vader the freedom to pursue the deepest secrets of the dark side. Beyond simple immortality, Sidious sought the power to [[Alter Reality|alter reality]] itself and bring every living being under his dark control.<ref name="Tarkin" /> As such, he was searching for immortality only as a way to prevent anything, even death itself, from standing between himself and ultimate power.<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" />

Over many years, Sidious sent explorers to unmapped regions of space to search for the source of the dark side, believing it lay there. These explorers built communication stations and [[Laboratory|labs]] on distant moons and asteroids.<ref name="Aftermath">[[Aftermath (novel)|''Aftermath'']]</ref> As part of his planned Contingency, Sidious had Imperial scouts explore the Unknown Regions while also utilizing extensive resources to seed laboratories, shipyards, and observatories within that same region.

=====The Tarkin Initiative=====
[[File:Moff_Tarkin.png|thumb|250px|Sidious had long supported the career of Wilhuff Tarkin, who became a Grand Moff in the Galactic Empire.]]
In his early days as Senator Palpatine, Sidious had closely associated with Wilhuff Tarkin, whom he encouraged to pursue a career in politics after his training with the Judicials was completed. Tarkin went on to become Governor of [[Eriadu]] and one of the Republic's foremost military leaders during the Clone Wars. Sidious had learned of Tarkin's upbringing on Eriadu, where he had been trained in harsh conditions through a brutal initiation in the wild [[Carrion Plateau]] of his homeworld. Tarkin had been taught to hunt savage creatures and emerged from his training with the belief that only the brutal application of the law and the fear of force could keep beings in line with a central galactic government. Although Tarkin lacked Force-sensitivity, Sidious identified him as one whose mindset was very close to that of the Sith.<ref name="Tarkin" />

During the early days of the Empire, making a rare public address, Sidious claimed the Empire would do whatever was needed to ensure a lasting reconciliation now that the Clone Wars had ended.<ref name="Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel" /> At some point during the Imperial Era, Sidious created an Imperial [[hunter droid]] named [[M-OC]]; additionally the B1 battle droid [[R0-GR]] of the [[Freemakers]] later claimed to have fought Sidious.<ref name="Droidography">''[[Star Wars: Droidography]]''</ref> The [[Ehllo family]] was an influential political dynasty during the Imperial Era, with Palpatine personally knowing Captain [[Cerasus Ehllo]]'s [[Cerasus Ehllo's father|father]].

=====The Inquisitorius=====

[[File:Inquisitorius-2017DarthVader6.png|thumb|260px|Darth Vader and the Grand Inquisitor led a unit of Jedi hunters, known as the Inquisitorius, in the Emperor's name.|left]]
Within his first year as Emperor of the Galactic Empire, Sidious brought to fruition an old idea<ref name="Children of the Force" /> with the formation of the [[Inquisitorius]], an [[organization]] composed of [[dark side adept]]s and tasked with hunting down surviving Jedi. The [[Inquisitor]]s were primarily captured Jedi who had been tortured until they turned to the dark side. However, a few, such as the [[the Grand Inquisitor]] and the [[Fifth Brother]], joined the Inquisitorius of their own accord.<ref name="The Dark Side" /><ref name="Battle Scars">''[[Star Wars Jedi: Battle Scars]]''</ref> Another was the former Jedi Knight Iskat Akaris, who Sidious spoke to in the Inquisitorius Headquarters on Coruscant, not long after she had received her uniform. He tested her willingness to continue her training in the dark side and made sure she understood that she and her fellow Inquisitors were substantially inferior to him. Sidious was impressed by Akaris' wits, as she had quickly realized that he was a Sith Lord and had by now identified the [[Heezo|agent]] he had assigned to help nudge her away from the Jedi over the course of the Clone Wars. He then told her to choose her path carefully before turning her over to the Fifth Brother.<ref name="Inquisitor: Rise of the Red Blade" />

=====The hunt for Jocasta Nu=====
{{Quote|She is ancient. Middling in the Force. Barely competent with a lightsaber. And yet, that crone could end everything we are trying to do. For you see, Jocasta Nu knows everything.|Darth Sidious, to Darth Vader|<ref name="Dark Lord 7" />}}
[[File:JocastaNu-Db.png|thumb|250px|Darth Sidious feared the repository of knowledge kept by the Jedi Chief Librarian Jocasta Nu could be used against him.]]
Sometime after his duel with Kirak Infil'a, Vader reported to Sidious on the ongoing training of the Inquisitors while also asking why Master [[Jocasta Nu]] was considered a priority among the list of surviving Jedi. Sidious explained that the threat she posed was that of knowledgeable scholar, one with access to a library of secrets and Force artifacts to rival any other. Additionally, Nu possessed the Jedi catalogue of Force-sensitive children in the galaxy. Sidious emphasized to his apprentice the need to capture her alive, insisting that they could use Nu's knowledge but could not afford to let her fall into the hands of others.

Thus, he ordered Vader to utilize the Inquisitors in his search but to keep the true nature of Nu's threat hidden from them.<ref name="Dark Lord 7">[[Darth Vader (2017) 7|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 7]]</ref> In a later meeting, Vader Force choked an [[Barokki|officer]] for giving a poor report until Sidious commanded him to release the man. While he could sympathize with his apprentice's frustration at the lack of Jedi to eliminate, Sidious warned Vader to avoid unnecessary killing of their inferiors.<ref name="Dark Lord 8">[[Darth Vader (2017) 8|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 8]]</ref> Not long after, Vader contacted Sidious to report that Nu had died while attempting to escape his custody, a development Sidious considered regrettable.<ref name="Dark Lord 10">[[Darth Vader (2017) 10|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 10]]</ref>

====The Imperial military====

=====Establishing the hierarchy=====
{{Quote|This is Lord Vader. He speaks with my voice. A command from him is as a command from me. Pass this information down to your men. All must understand.|Emperor Palpatine|<ref name="Dark Lord 12" />}}
[[File:ChockedOfficers-2017DarthVader12.png|left|thumb|With the Emperor's permission, Vader choked several Imperial officers to death via the Force.|250x250px]]
After foiling two attempts on his life, Vader traced an assassination conspiracy to the highest levels of the Imperial government and proceeded to meet Sidious near Nu's secret vault. Despite his apprentice's failure to capture Nu alive, Sidious was pleased with the artifacts recovered from her hoard. In response to Vader's suspicion of him, Sidious took a moment to examine his apprentice's rebuilt [[Darth Vader's lightsaber|lightsaber]], nodding in approval over the change from Kirak Infil'a's original hilt. He then pointed out that he had no need to hire mercenaries to eliminate Vader if he had wanted him dead. Sidious told Vader that dealing with the plot was his own responsibility, warning him that with great power come infinite enemies to destroy.<ref name="Dark Lord 12">[[Darth Vader (2017) 12|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 12]]</ref>

Vader soon identified one of the conspirators, an Imperial officer, and sought the Emperor's permission to make an example to solidify his role in the Empire's hierarchy. Sidious agreed, telling him that he could kill any officer but Tarkin. Later, the Emperor gathered the [[Imperial Officer Corps]], presenting his apprentice to them and telling them that they were to treat Vader as they would him. Vader then called for the known conspirator and four random officers to step forward, before Force choking them to death in front of the assembly.<ref name="Dark Lord 12" />

=====Replacing the clone army=====
{{Quote|Perhaps, it is time for a change. Now more than ever, building a strong galaxy requires protection and security. Due to the nefarious actions of Admiral Rampart, and the immediacy of the bill on the floor today, it is my opinion that this legislation is our future. With this momentous act, we shall usher in a new era. Heralded by the Imperial stormtrooper.|Emperor Palpatine, to the Imperial Senate|<ref name="Truth and Consequences">{{TBB|Truth and Consequences}}</ref>}}
Around the same time, Sidious saw fit to finally replace the outdated Clone Army with a new conscripted military that would be loyal to him. However, in spite of his power in reality being absolute, he continued using the Senate as a puppet to make it seem that his role as Emperor was not particularly different from when he was Chancellor. Therefore, Sidious relied on people interested in sharing in his power, such as Admiral [[Edmon Rampart]]: idealistic followers that could serve as scapegoats while furthering the Sith Lord's plans. Governor Tarkin had perceived the clones to be twice as expensive as a proposed new militaristic force and deemed them less capable as tools to keep the order.<ref name="Kamino Lost">{{TBB|Kamino Lost}}</ref> Already that year,<ref name="TBB Date">''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]'' places the events of [[The Bad Batch Season 1|''The Bad Batch'' Season 1]] in [[19 BBY]].</ref> the stage was secretly being set to replace the clones with an army of volunteers and conscripts from across the galaxy. The Kaminoans clung to the fact that their skills as cloners was the only thing of relevance to the Empire. However, their overall use was terminated when Admiral Rampart ordered the destruction of Tipoca City after clearing out it of valuables.<ref name="Kamino Lost" />

Following the successful orbital bombardment of Tipoca City, the Empire's official explanation was that the cloning facilities had been sunk down to the oceans by a harsh storm, despite the structures having been built to endure Kamino's extreme climate. By the next year, new legislation of interest to Sidious lay before the Senate: the [[Imperial Defense Recruitment Bill]], a formalization of the Clone Army's decommissioning and the shift to an Imperial Military. Sidious preferred not to deal with the issue directly, having Vice Chair Mas Amedda preside over Senate sessions with Rampart pushing for the bill. A major opponent of the proposed legislation was Senator [[Riyo Chuchi]] who sought to provide missing representation for the clones in the development of the bill. During a Senate session, Senator Organa asked Mas Amedda what the absent Emperor's position on the bill was; the Vice Chair replied that the Emperor preferred to remain neutral, trusting the Senate to act in the best interests of Imperial citizens. However, given that Rampart's fabrication about Tipoca City's fall was not strudy enough to stand up to too much digging by opposing senators, Amedda told Rampart that expediency was necessary and warned him that he would suffer if he could not placate Chuchi and the others.<ref name="The Clone Conspiracy">{{TBB|The Clone Conspiracy}}</ref>

Despite Rampart's efforts to appease his detractors and obfuscate independent investigation, the bill was rejected twice in preliminary hearings, the harshest criticisms being voiced by Senators Chuchi, Organa and Pamlo. When the bill was at last about brought before the chamber for a vote with Rampart having satisfied Chuchi's demands for a fair retirement for the clones, the Pantoran Senator interjected again, bringing forward former Kaminoan Senator Halle Burtoni to testify how Rampart had reappropriated Senate funds designated for Kamino directly into financing his own projects and recruitments. As Rampart attempted to explain this away, Senator Organa entered and played a command log taken from Rampart's own Venator showing the entire Senate how Tipoca City really fell.<ref name="Truth and Consequences" />

[[File:HoloDestructionTipocaCity.png|thumb|250px|With the Emperor's support, the Imperial Senate voted to pass the recruitment bill after learning that clones destroyed the facilities on Kamino.]]Faced with a drastic situation, the Emperor saw fit to finally attend a [[Imperial Senate|Senate]] hearing in person and arose in his Chancellor's podium, which caused the entire [[Imperial Senate Building|Senate hall]] to fall silent as their leader made one of his few appearances since the Empire's foundation. Fraught with overwhelming evidence, the Emperor decided that Rampart's value had ceased and had Mas Amedda direct guards to arrest him. Not allowing this to stop his plans to remove the clones, the Emperor spoke out with the same mannerisms as when he was Chancellor and voiced his surprise at Admiral Rampart's acts of transgression against the Kaminoans. He promised that the admiral would be punished for his treachery.<ref name="Truth and Consequences" />

Now faced with a golden opportunity, the Emperor manipulated the situation to benefit his own position by reminding the Senators that Rampart did not act alone; that the clones aboard the Venators willingly unleashed carnage upon their own home without hesitation. Providing sound argument that security in the galaxy was needed more than ever and recognizing the bill's immediate necessity, the Emperor stated his belief that the Imperial Defense Recruitment Bill was their future. Despite framing this as more of a suggestion than an order, the Emperor displayed how supreme his authority was as the bill was immediately passed.<ref name="Truth and Consequences" />

Although he had presented a compelling narrative, many senators remained skeptical. Nonetheless, Palpatine had made a crucial step in further facilitating his power in the Empire and control over the galaxy, confirming the phasing out of the clone army and eliminating another crucial remnant of the Republic, with only the Senate remaining. The age of the Imperial [[stormtrooper]] had now begun.<ref name="Truth and Consequences" />

=====Invasion of Mon Cala=====
{{Quote|Mon Cala. They may serve well as an example--the price of defiance. The military power of the Empire has grown significantly in these past months. It is time to reveal that strength.|Darth Sidious|<ref name="Dark Lord 13" />}}
[[File:MonCalaISDs-2017DarthVader15.jpg|thumb|250px|Sidious sent the Imperial fleet under Tarkin and the Inquisitorius under Vader to subjugate Mon Cala.|left]]
Sidious soon chose to demonstrate the power of the revamped [[Imperial Military]] by invading [[Mon Cala]]. Since [[Project Stardust]] was far from complete, he opted to send a task force commanded by Tarkin to occupy the planet. Suspecting that a surviving Jedi had been advising [[King]] [[Lee-Char]], Sidious sent Vader and the Inquisitorius along to root out and eliminate the threat.<ref name="Dark Lord 13">[[Darth Vader (2017) 13|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 13]]</ref> The ensuing battle ended in an Imperial victory after Tarkin ordered an orbital bombardment which compelled Lee-Char to surrender. At the same time, the Jedi [[Ferren Barr]] confronted Vader, revealing that he had helped orchestrate events leading to the Imperial genocide of Mon Cala after having foreseen the role the [[Mon Calamari]] would later play in defeating the Empire. Shortly thereafter, Barr was slain by the Sith Lord in a lightsaber duel.<ref name="Dark Lord 17">[[Darth Vader (2017) 17|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 17]]</ref>

Later that same year,<ref name="DVA2 Date">''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]'' dates the events of ''Darth Vader Annual'' 2 to [[18 BBY]].</ref> Tarkin contacted Sidious when Vader entered the [[Scarif vault]] without authorization to learn more for himself about Project Stardust. Sidious ordered Vader to help Tarkin by rooting out saboteurs whose work was slowing down the project's progress, sending him to Geonosis. He also put Vader under the Governor's command.<ref name="Dark Lord Annual 2">[[Darth Vader Annual 2|''Darth Vader Annual'' 2]]</ref>

=====Visit to Mount Tantiss=====
{{Quote|It is imperative that this facility remain hidden and secure. There are many, even within our own ranks, who would consider much of your work an abomination. But they lack the vision we possess. Your brilliance is a great asset to this Empire.|Emperor Palpatine, to Doctor Hemlock|<ref name="Dark Lord 13" />}}
[[File:HemlockAdmiresPalps-TBB-SoT.png|thumb|275px|Sidious was pleased with the progress Royce Hemlock had made on Project Necromancer.]]
Six months after the Senate voted to replace the clone army,<ref name="SoT Date">[[Omega]] tracks the days (164) that have passed since her capture in "[[Plan 99]]," which takes place sometime after "[[Truth and Consequences]]". Therefore, the events of "[[Shadows of Tantiss]]" must take place approximately six months after the Emperor's speech in the [[Imperial Senate]].</ref> the Emperor made a surprise visit to the secret [[Mount Tantiss]] [[Tantiss Base|facility]] on [[Wayland]] to review the progress Doctors [[Royce Hemlock]] and Nala Se had made on [[Project Necromancer]]. Hemlock gave him a tour of the site, ending with a [[Tantiss vault|tightly guarded chamber]] containing specimens crucial to the project. The doctor stated that with more time and resources, he was confident that they would be able to successfully replicate M-counts. Considering their work of paramount importance, the Emperor assured Hemlock that he would have whatever he required for the project.<ref name="Shadows of Tantiss">{{TBB|Shadows of Tantiss}}</ref>

On the landing pad, en route to his shuttle, the Emperor stressed to Hemlock the need to keep the existence of the base a secret, warning that many beings, even other Imperials, would not look kindly upon the research being performed there. Palpatine then complimented the doctor on his brilliance, with Hemlock responding that, with an appointment to scientific minister, he would be able to bring his abilities to bear upon the entire scientific corps. The Emperor warned him to be patient before departing.<ref name="Shadows of Tantiss" />

=====The Chiss from the Unknown Regions=====
[[File:EmperorsThroneRoom-Thrawn1.jpg|thumb|250px|Sidious gained a talented servant in Mitth'raw'nuruodo "Thrawn," a Chiss officer from the Unknown Regions.|left]]
During the Empire's reign, Sidious' interest in the Unknown Regions continued. This came to a head when the crew of the ''Venator''-class Star Destroyer ''[[Strikefast]]'', under the command of Captain [[Voss Parck]], encountered the [[Chiss]] known as [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] in [[Wild Space]]. Many years earlier, Anakin Skywalker told Palpatine of this alien and how they worked together. This alien claimed to have a great deal of knowledge on the Unknown Regions. Thrawn was then brought before the Emperor on Coruscant in order to be questioned. Thrawn told the Emperor of threats lurking within the Unknown Regions and how they might one day find the Empire and offered his military skills. The Emperor then deduced that Thrawn's intentions were to help protect his people from these threats. Thrawn assured the Emperor that his allegiance would be to the Empire. Thrawn then revealed that he had known Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars, thus proving who he was to the Emperor.<ref name="Thrawn">[[Thrawn (novel)|''Thrawn'']]</ref>

For their service, the Emperor promised Captain Parck and his crew rewards. Thrawn however, requested that his translator [[Eli N. Vanto|Eli Vanto]] stay with him. The Emperor then asked Thrawn to walk with him outside. In his personal garden, the Emperor told the Chiss of his interest in the Unknown Regions. Thrawn then warned that there was great danger to be found there, however, he assured the Emperor that he would share his knowledge of the Unknown Regions. The Emperor ordered that Eli Vanto would be transferred to Thrawn's side and that they would both undergo training at the [[Royal Imperial Academy]].<ref name="Thrawn" />

====Mission to Ryloth====
=====An official visit=====
[[File:LessuEmpire-DD.png|thumb|250px|Sidious and Vader visited Ryloth, the Twi'lek homeworld that the Empire occupied after the Clone Wars.]]
[[14 BBY|Five years]] after the end of the Clone Wars, [[Cham Syndulla]], a war hero who liberated [[Ryloth]] from the Separatist forces during the war, organized and led the [[Free Ryloth Movement]] in order to liberate his homeworld once again, this time from an Imperial military occupation. Sidious summoned the Senator of Ryloth, [[Orn Free Taa]], in order to incorporate the senator into his plan to eradicate the "terrorists." He ordered the [[Twi'lek]] to accompany him and his right-hand man, Darth Vader, for an official [[Mission to Ryloth|visit]] to Ryloth. Once Sidious dismissed Taa, Vader asked him why he couldn't simply wipe out the Senator along with his entire staff, in which the two Sith suspected there were one or more traitors, who provided aid to the terrorist movement. But the Emperor wished to find the roots of the treachery, eliminate them and make of it an example for the entire galaxy. Eventually, he ordered Vader to inform the [[Moff]] of Ryloth, [[Delian Mors]], of the arrival of Senator Orn Free Taa, but not of the two of them.<ref name="LOTS">''[[Lords of the Sith]]''</ref>

=====Assassination attempt on the ''Defiance''=====
While on the way to Ryloth aboard the Star Destroyer ''[[Perilous]]'', Sidious instructed the ship to stop at the [[Denon]] [[Denon system|system]] for a meeting on the training cruiser [[Obedience|''Defiance'']] with several [[Imperial Navy]] chiefs to discuss a realignment of the Imperial Naval Academy. Sidious ordered Darth Vader to oversee training exercises conducted by [[Commandant]] [[Pell Baylo]] while the Emperor was in his meeting with the naval chiefs. During one such exercise, Baylo set a [[hyperspace]] route that would have crashed the ''Defiance'' into [[Christophsis' sun]]. [[Cadet]] [[Rae Sloane]] and Darth Vader uncovered this assassination attempt and redirected the ''Defiance''. Baylo confronted the Emperor, accusing the Galactic Empire of being a hostile force that had taken over the Galactic Republic. Vader killed Baylo, which upset Sidious, who wanted Baylo to suffer as the Navy becomes something he hated and watch as the ''Defiance'' was decommissioned and turned into "cafeteria trays." Instead, the ''Defiance'' was renamed ''Obedience'' as a final jab at Baylo and a not-so-subtle reminder toward Vader to remember his place, and Sidious and Vader re-boarded the ''Perilous'' and continued on their way to Ryloth.<ref name="Orientation">{{InsiderCite|157|Orientation}}</ref>

=====The fall of the ''Perilous''=====
[[File:EmperorAmused-Orientation.png|thumb|250px|Sidious was the target of assassination plots throughout his reign.|left]]
The two Sith and Senator Taa came to the [[Ryloth system]] aboard ''Perilous''. When the ship exited from the hyperspace, they found themselves in the middle of a minefield: Syndulla was waiting for them. The Twi'lek wished to eliminate them to strike at the heart of the Empire. However, Sidious was unperturbed by the ambush, having evidently foreseen such an occurrence. When the shields were overwhelmed, Sidious remained on the bridge, while Vader took off with his fighter leading a squadron to deal with a swarm of [[Vulture-class starfighter|vulture droids]]. The former Separatist fighters released thousands of explosive [[Pistoeka sabotage droid|buzz droids]] which further damaged the Star Destroyer. Vader returned aboard the ''Perilous'' where he met the Emperor and Senator Taa after finding that the Emperor's personal shuttle had been destroyed in the attack. Because he suspected there was a traitor in the Senator's staff, Sidious ordered to isolate them in their own quarters and deny them access to any communications equipment.<ref name="LOTS" />

In the meantime, a Twi'lek task force reached the ship disguised as a repair team and placed explosive charges in the [[hyperdrive]] chamber, to trigger a chain reaction. After discovering the sabotage and realizing that the ship was doomed, Vader contacted the Emperor. The Emperor informed Vader that he had prepared a second shuttle either as a contingency or because he had foreseen the destruction of the first shuttle and told Vader to meet him there. However, Vader delayed his arrival by a few minutes in an attempt to find and eliminate the saboteurs. The Twi'lek rebels just barely managed to escape, and so Vader hurried to the Emperor's shuttle, which departed as soon as Vader was aboard. A few minutes later, the ''Perilous'' exploded. Once in space, the fugitive task force searched for the Imperial shuttle and caught up with it. Vader Force choked the resistance pilot of the pursuing ship through the shuttle viewport. In a desperate attempt to get free from Vader's grasp and to kill both him and the Emperor, the Twi'leks rammed the stolen starship into the Imperial shuttle, critically damaging the latter. Vader attempted to regain control of the shuttle while Sidious remembered they had already been in situations like this. Thanks to the piloting skills of Vader the shuttle crash-landed on Ryloth's surface, in the middle of a forest.<ref name="LOTS" />

=====Isolated on the planet=====
{{Quote|We are all of us, always being tested, my friend. Tests make us stronger, and strength is power, and power is the ''point''. We must pass all the tests we face&hellip; Or die in the effort.|Darth Sidious, to Darth Vader|<ref name="LOTS" />}}
[[File:Imperial_Royal_Guards_Unit_Expansion_art.png|thumb|224px|Sidious and Vader were stranded on Ryloth with only a few Royal Guards.]]
Once on the planet surface, Sidious noted with mild annoyance that the landing had been far beneath what he knew Vader to be capable of and that Vader's lapse had left four corpses in the rear compartment of the shuttle. Vader admitted to having been distracted by thoughts of his past and attempted to dismiss it as nothing. Sidious however, was unconvinced, though he shelved the matter and proceeded with Vader into the rear compartment. There, three of the shuttle's occupants, [[Sergeant]] [[Erstin Deez]], his captain, and another member of the [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Imperial Guard]] had survived the crash, though one was badly injured and unconscious. Vader noted with mild surprise that the Emperor appeared to have been wrong; there were only three corpses in the compartment. One of the conscious guards noted that his injured comrade had not strapped himself in during the landing, and as a result had been thrown about the compartment when the ship had crashed. However, the Emperor, apparently already aware of the semi-conscious guard, had him executed for his stupidity, leaving the fourth corpse he had mentioned earlier.<ref name="LOTS" />

The survivors exited in the night, and while the two guards who survived were checking the survival kits, Vader asked his master if he was testing him. Sidious answered they were always being tested, and they must pass all tests to gain strength and power. Meanwhile, the guards had activated the generator and the communication array to call for help. At that moment the Sith sensed that two Twi'lek ships were approaching and prepared themselves for a confrontation. The Twi'lek rebel's ships fired upon them, while Vader, immersed in the Force, deflected the laser beams with his lightsaber.<ref name="LOTS" />

The captain suggested to take cover in the woods, but the Emperor refused and instead, removed his cloak, and ignited his lightsaber. The two Sith spun their red blades, turning every shot back at the ships. When the enemy ships engines were hit and began to explode in flames and smoke, Sidious unleashed a bolt of Force lightning on their hulls and then, with the Force, drove one of the ships to the ground, while Vader did the same with the other. The two freighters exploded, and Vader sent Deez to check for survivors. They realized the rebels had jammed the communication network and that they were hunting for them.<ref name="LOTS" />

=====Hunted=====
[[File:Lylek-SWGA.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sidious fended off a horde of lyleks with Vader's help.]]
They walked for a long time into the depths of the forest. Sidious went forward in the darkness seeing through the Force while testing Vader's loyalty once again until he decided to stop for a while. While the guards were eating, the two Sith began to meditate. The Emperor sensed his apprentice's murderous feelings towards him. When Vader ended his meditation, Sidious told him what he had sensed, but the former Jedi pledged his loyalty to his Sith Master. At that moment, the guards, whom the Emperor had sent away, had returned, pursued by a horde of [[lylek]]s. The Emperor remained calm, sending torrents of Force lightning against the predators, and began to advance back-to-back with Vader, their lightsabers ignited.<ref name="LOTS" />

While Vader and the guardsmen held back the advancing lyleks with their weapons, Sidious used the Force to topple trees over the advancing lylek horde. Through the Force, Sidious sensed a tunnel a hundred meters away. The four retreated into the tunnel with the lyleks in pursuit. This tunnel turned out to be the home of the lylek horde, and the four Imperials were forced to fight through hundreds of the creatures. The guards used their blasters and [[grenade]]s while the two Sith Lords used the Force and their lightsabers to fight through the horde.<ref name="LOTS" />

As they waded deeper into the cave, Sidious realized that the lyleks were herding the intruders towards their queen. At Vader's instigation, the four resolved to kill all their opponents with the Emperor activating his red blade. After a fierce battle with the lyleks, Sidious and Vader found themselves back-to-back. When Sidious asked his apprentice whether he had ever toyed with the idea of letting his Emperor die to fulfill his own ambitions, Vader admitted he had entertained such thoughts but reassured his master it was only for a moment. Sidious accepted Vader's loyalty and the two joined forces to tackle the lylek queen.<ref name="LOTS" />

Following a savage battle, Vader managed to kill the queen; scattering the remaining lyleks. However, the royal guard captain was killed, leaving only Sidious, Vader, and Sergeant Deez. Based on their battle with the lyleks, master and apprentice quickly surmised that Cham and his rebels were trying to kill them to bring about the Empire's destruction. Having triumphed over the lylek horde, the three Imperials found an opening at the end of the tunnel which led back to the forest.<ref name="LOTS" />

=====Death and fate=====
[[File:Drua_s_village.jpg|thumb|200px|On Sidious' order, Vader slaughtered a village of Twi'leks that provided them with shelter.]]
While Sidious and his companions were traveling through the forest, they encountered a young Twi'lek girl named [[Drua]]. Sidious made a move to kill her, but Vader blocked his master's death blow and convinced Sidious that she could lead them to a settlement where they could contact reinforcements. Drua led them to [[Drua's Village|her village]], which was home to escaped Twi'lek slaves. When the village head [[Narmn]] asked for their identities, Sidious introduced himself, Vader, and Deez as "Krataa," "Irluuk," and the Sergeant. Sidious and Vader alone knew that their pseudonyms stood for "death" and "fate."<ref name="LOTS" />

Sidious warned Vader that his act of mercy towards Drua would cost both her and her fellow villagers their lives. Vader then managed to win over the villagers by offering to repair an ancient communications device. Once Vader had fixed the machine, Sidious ordered Deez to contact Moff Mors; whom he knew to be loyal. After re-establishing contact with the two Sith Lords, Mors took steps to eliminate the Imperial traitor [[Colonel]] [[Belkor Dray]], who was secretly aiding Cham's rebels. She foiled Belkor's plot to order V-wing fighters to strike Drua's Village and the massed Free Ryloth forces in a nearby quarry. After executing Belkor, Moff Mors sent her forces to rendezvous with Sidious and Vader at the Twi'lek village.<ref name="LOTS" />

[[File:Lords_of_the_Sith_art.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Empire crushed the Ryloth insurgency under the leadership of the Sith.]]
Cham's forces, unwilling to harm the villagers, fired warning shots so that the villagers would flee the scene of the upcoming battle. The villagers reacted by fleeing to a nearby mine shaft, a sanctuary in time of danger. However, Sidious, Vader, and Deez stood their ground at the center of the village. Before Cham's forces could launch their attack, Moff Mors' forces arrived in two transport vessels and trapped the rebel fighters. With many of the Free Ryloth fighters killed, Cham narrowly managed to avoid capture at the hands of Vader. Under the orders of Sidious, Mors's Imperial forces massacred the surviving Free Ryloth fighters. Following a brief exchange with Cham's lieutenant [[Isval]], Sidious ordered Vader to execute her and then afterward, the surviving Twi'lek villagers hiding in the mine shaft as well, in order not to leave any witnesses. After a brief moment of hesitation, Vader complied with his master's orders and massacred the villagers.<ref name="LOTS" />

===Growing rebellion===
====Berch Teller's campaign====
In 14 BBY,<ref name="Tarkin date">''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]'' dates the events of [[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']] to [[14 BBY]].</ref> the secret Death Star project was still being constructed above Geonosis and was supplied by a series of marshaling stations. The Empire faced a new threat in the form of [[Berch Teller]], a former [[Republic Intelligence]] agent who opposed the Empire. He led a [[Berch Teller's rebel cell|rebel cell]] consisting of survivors and witnesses of the [[Antar Atrocity]], a mass crackdown on [[Antar 4]] following the Clone Wars that had seen the killing of innocent [[Gotal]] and [[Koorivar]] loyalists. Teller had a special animus for Tarkin, the architect of the Antar Atrocity. He was secretly aided and equipped by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Dodd Rancit]], the Director of the Naval Intelligence Agency and a rival of Tarkin.<ref name="Tarkin" />

[[File:Mission_to_Murkhana.jpg|thumb|250px|Tarkin and Vader worked together in service to the Emperor.]]
Following Teller's [[Attack on Sentinel Base|attack]] on [[Sentinel Base]], the Emperor convened a meeting of his [[Ruling Council]] to discuss the discovery of a cache of communications jammers on the planet [[Murkhana]]. The [[Imperial Security Bureau]] had purportedly discovered the cache and feared that dissidents were planning to disrupt the Imperial [[HoloNet]]; echoing the Separatist [[Shadowfeed]] broadcasts during the Clone Wars. The Emperor dispatched both Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader to [[Mission to Murkhana|investigate]] the matter. However, this played into Teller's hands and allowed the insurgents to steal Tarkin's corvette ''[[Carrion Spike]]'', which they intended to turn into a symbol of resistance against the Empire.<ref name="Tarkin" />

After being briefed about the theft of the ''Carrion Spike'', Vice Admiral Rancit suggested that the ship's thieves were the same people who attacked Sentinel Base earlier. In response, the Emperor ordered Rancit to divert Imperial forces in the [[Belderone system]] to aid Tarkin and Lord Vader. While Tarkin and Vader pursued the insurgents, the Emperor chaired another meeting of the Ruling Council. During the meeting, Rancit advocated diverting more Imperial forces to reinforcing Imperial facilities across the [[Perlemian Trade Route]] and [[Hydian Way]]. The Council also learned that Teller' insurgents had [[Attack on Lucazec|attacked]] the [[Tagge Corporation|TaggeCo]] mining facilities on [[Lucazec]] and were transmitting [[holovid]]s of their attacks on the HoloNet.<ref name="Tarkin" />

[[File:Grand_Vizier_Amedda.png|thumb|left|250px|Having supported Sidious' rise to power, Mas Amedda secured his position in the New Order as the Emperor's Grand Vizier.]]
Following a [[Battle in the Phindar system|skirmish]] in the [[Phindar system]] between Imperial forces and the stolen ''Carrion Spike'', Rancit convinced the Emperor to deploy [[interdictor]] vessels against the insurgents. Grand Vizier Amedda then informed the Emperor that the Murkhana communications jammers had been discovered by an ISB asset tasked with investigating the find by his case officer. Acting on this information, Sidious interrogated the Koorivar [[Imperial Security Bureau|ISB]] asset [[Bracchia]] and his case officer [[Stellan]], who revealed that they had been tipped about the discovery by Naval Intelligence. After viewing the holovid, the Emperor determined that the communications cache had been planted by a high&ndash;level Imperial official who was aiding the insurgents.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Meanwhile, Lord Vader discovered that Rancit was the Imperial traitor and executed him. While Tarkin led Imperial forces against Teller's insurgents in a [[Battle near the Gulf of Tatooine|space battle]] near the [[Gulf of Tatooine]], Darth Sidious mediated on his quest for galactic dominance. Following the defeat of Teller's insurgency, Tarkin and Vader spent the next three weeks hunting down Teller's collaborators and contacts in a ruthless crackdown. The two briefed the Emperor, who appointed Tarkin as [[Grand Moff]], in which capacity he would serve as [[governor]] of the Outer Rim Territories and stand in charge of the Death Star project. The Emperor also reshuffled the Ruling Council in the wake of Rancit's execution, folded Naval Intelligence back into [[Imperial Intelligence]],<ref name="Tarkin" /> and established the [[Council of Moffs]].<ref name="Emperor Palpatine" />

By 14 BBY,<ref name="Fallen Order date note">The events of ''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]'' take place about five [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Mission to Mustafar|end]] of the [[Clone Wars]], which ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates to [[19 BBY]]. Therefore, it can be deduced that the events of ''Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order'', including [[Project Auger]], take place around [[14 BBY]].</ref> Sidious had also ordered for [[Project Auger]] to begin on the planet [[Zeffo]], which had been home to the [[Zeffonian]] before their hubris nearly destroyed them. The project saw Imperial mining begin on Zeffo to locate artifacts. The commanding officer, [[Krane]], kept one uncovered artifact secret in order to win support from Sidious by giving it to him personally. However, she died when the cave she chose to hide it in collapsed.<ref name="Jedi Fallen Order">''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]''</ref>

====A reward for Vader====
{{Quote|I think, one way or another, you will learn a great deal. That is good. After all, your power is my power.|Darth Sidious, to Darth Vader|<ref name="Dark Lord 21" />}}
Shortly after [[Hunt for Eeth Koth|he killed]] Eeth Koth,<ref name="Dark Lord 19">[[Darth Vader (2017) 19|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 19]]</ref> Vader attacked the Thirteenth Sister for committing treason. Confused, her [[Tualon Yaluna|partner]] tried to defend her before they both fled Inquisitorius Headquarters across Coruscant. The Sith Lord eventually caught up with the couple and slew them. However, the destruction caused by the chase and resultant death of [[Senator]] [[Maklooq]], who was important to one of Sidious' schemes, led the Emperor to order the Inquisitorius to be relocated. Their [[Fortress Inquisitorius|new base]] was built on [[Nur]].<ref name="Dark Lord 20">[[Darth Vader (2017) 20|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 20]]</ref><ref name="Inquisitor: Rise of the Red Blade" /> Pleased with the death of Koth, Sidious gifted Vader the former royal vessel of Queen Amidala. With few Jedi left to deal with, Sidious was about to send his apprentice on other missions when Vader asked for a world of his own: Mustafar.<ref name="Dark Lord 20" /> Sidious granted the request but demanded to know why his apprentice had chosen the site of his greatest defeat. Vader explained that he believed that the dark side locus there could give him access to the dead Amidala. Sidious encouraged him, satisfied that whatever knowledge or power his apprentice gained there would ultimately be his. He gave Vader one final gift, the mask of [[Darth Momin]], before sending him to Mustafar with the architect Colonel [[Alva Brenne|Brenne]] to design a [[Fortress Vader|fortress]] for him.<ref name="Dark Lord 21">[[Darth Vader (2017) 21|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 21]]</ref>

When Sidious asked him if he had learned what he needed, Vader confirmed as much with a simple "yes" and no elaboration.<ref name="Dark Lord 25">[[Darth Vader (2017) 25|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 25]]</ref>

Sometime around or after this,<ref name="KX Parade Date">Given that [[K-2SO|K2-SO]] was built in [[12 BBY]] according to ''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]'' and was part of the parade according to "[[Who Else Knows?]]", it must have taken place somtime during or after 12 [['ABY-BBY' dating system|BBY]].</ref> the Emperor was present at a parade that included two hundred [[KX-series security droid]]s, among them [[K-2SO|K2-SO]].<ref name="Who Else Knows?">{{Andor|Who Else Knows?}}</ref>

====New threats====
=====From the past to the present=====
{{Quote|I wonder if your thoughts are clear on this, Lord Vader. Perhaps your feelings for your old master have left you weakened. If your past cannot be overcome&hellip;|Darth Sidious, to Darth Vader|<ref name="Part VI">{{Kenobi|Part VI}}</ref>}}
[[File:EmperorPalpatine-OWKpVI.png|thumb|250px|Following Darth Vader's defeat by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Sidious counseled his apprentice against allowing his emotions to weaken him.]]
In [[9 BBY]],<ref name="KenobiDate">{{KenobiDate|VI}}</ref> Darth Vader<ref name="Part II">{{Kenobi|Part II}}</ref> and the Inquisitorius engaged in a [[hunt for Obi-Wan]] Kenobi, who had been engineered to come out of hiding in order to rescue [[Princess]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of Alderaan.<ref name="Kenobi Part I">{{Kenobi|Part I}}</ref> Though the search had been fabricated by the [[Reva Sevander|Third Sister]] to kill Vader, her attempts failed,<ref name="Part V">{{Kenobi|Part V}}</ref> and Vader and Kenobi engaged in a [[Fight on a barren moon|lightsaber duel]] on a [[Unidentified barren moon|barren moon]] as a result. Kenobi bested Vader, damaging his armor in the process, and he managed to evade the Imperials on his tail. Not long after, Vader, whose armor was since repaired, reached out to his master via a hologram at Fortress Vader,<ref name="Part VI" /> his castle on Mustafar.<ref name="Databank Vader">{{Databank|darth-vader|Darth Vader}}</ref> He informed Sidious he had dispatched [[probe droid]]s to continue the search for Kenobi, adding that he would not evade him once again. Picking up on Vader's agitation, Sidious questioned if Vader's thoughts on the matter were clear, continuing that perhaps has feelings for his former master had left him weakened. As Sidious asked if Vader could not overcome his past, Vader declared that Kenobi meant nothing, for he only served Sidious.<ref name="Part VI" />

With the Jedi mostly defeated, Sidious felt secure behind his huge galactic military and dominion over most of the known galaxy. Despite this, remaining Separatist holdouts and surviving Jedi would gnaw at his confidence of the longevity of his new Empire. Seeking to secure the center, the Emperor supported mass military excursions into the Outer Rim Territories in an effort to bring more systems under his fold. With his ultimate goal of bending reality into something of his own creation, an omnipotent Empire would allow all the galaxy's inhabitants to be held in his dark embrace.<ref name="Tarkin" /> Despite the Jedi being all but extinct, Force-sensitive children were still being born across the galaxy. In an effort to combat this threat, Sidious commanded his apprentice, Lord Vader, to contact [[the Grand Inquisitor]] to hunt them down and destroy them if they did not serve the Empire.<ref name="Spark of Rebellion">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]''</ref>

Following the [[Aldhani heist|raid]] on the Imperial [[Aldhani Garrison|garrison]] on [[Aldhani]]<ref name="The Eye">{{Andor|The Eye}}</ref> in [[5 BBY]],<ref name="Kassa">{{Andor|Kassa (episode)}}</ref> Palpatine spoke with Colonel Yularen, giving the ISB direct control of operations going forward and the authority to arrest anyone who was considered a disrupter to the Empire. The next day, the Emperor convened an emergency session of the Senate in order to propose a legislative package of bills and amendments and to officially invoke the [[Public Order Resentencing Directive]].<ref name="Announcement">{{Andor|Announcement}}</ref>

=====Targets on Ghorman and Lothal=====
{{Quote|I believe the apprentice of Anakin Skywalker lives and is in league with these rebels."<br />"Are you certain?"<br />"It was ''her''."<br />"This is an opportunity we cannot let ''pass''.

In [[4 BBY]],<ref name="Andor 2.1 Date">{{AndorDate|201}}</ref> the Emperor met with [[Director of Advanced Weapons Research|Director]] [[Orson Callan Krennic|Orson Krennic]], stating to him the importance of his energy initiative. The next day, Krennic secretly met with a number of Imperial officials, among them ISB and Navy, off record at the [[Maltheen Divide]], putting them in charge of the [[Ghorman project]]: the planned suppression of the [[Ghorman (people)|Ghormans]] and the heavy mining of the essential mineral [[kalkite]] from the [[Ghorman|planet]]. This operation would be implemented only if no substitute could be found, but in the meantime precursor actions would be taken in case it proved necessary. Krennic stated that this would support the Emperor's dream of energy independence while also reiterating that their circle was to be free of leaks, adding that any violation would be brought to the Emperor's personal attention. Two of the officials present, [[Dee Shambo]] and [[Nisus Osar]] from the [[Ministry of Enlightenment]], were placed in charge of spreading anti-Ghorman propaganda. ISB Major [[Lio Partagaz]] was present as was his protégé [[Supervisor]] [[Dedra Meero]], who was secretly placed in charge of running Ghorman while publicly being given a discommendation.<ref name="One Year Later">{{Andor|One Year Later}}</ref>

[[File:Ahsoka_Tano_hero_profile.png|thumb|left|250x250px|Darth Sidious believed that capturing Ahsoka Tano would give the Empire the opportunity to eliminate more surviving Jedi.]]During the fifteenth [[Empire Day]], celebrating the anniversary of the Empire's rise to power, the Emperor presided over the Imperial Senate on Coruscant with his Royal Guards, and invited [[Lothal]] governor [[Arihnda Pryce]] to celebrate with him.<ref name="Empire Day">{{Rebels|Empire Day (episode)}}</ref> After the Grand Inquisitor's death at the hands of Kanan Jarrus and his Padawan [[Ezra Bridger]], the Emperor dispatched his apprentice to Lothal as an "alternative solution" to the growing rebel problem.<ref name="Fire Across the Galaxy">{{Rebels|Fire Across the Galaxy}}</ref> The Emperor was contacted by Darth Vader after he had [[Attack on Phoenix Squadron (4 BBY)|defeated]] the Rebel fleet in the [[Lothal system]]. Vader informed his master that he had discovered that his former Jedi apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, still lived. The Emperor was pleased with the news that Tano possibly knew the location of other hidden Jedi believed that capturing her would allow the Empire to find them and destroy them before they became threats. Although Vader was more interested in finding his former Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Emperor told his apprentice to have patience and to send an Inquisitor to hunt down Tano and the other Jedi discovered on Lothal.<ref name="The Siege of Lothal">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal]]''</ref>

By [[3 BBY]],<ref name="Andor 2.4 Date">{{AndorDate|204}}</ref> anti-Ghorman proganda had proved effective, including the idea that the Ghor were arrogant and mocked Emperor Palpatine. Around the same time, Colonel Yularen and Major Lio Partagaz of the ISB were scheduled to meet with the Emperor on the logistics of the Bureau's increase in arrests while Ghor Senator [[Dasi Oran]] informed his colleague Mon Mothma that he could no longer vote with her against the Emperor's legislation after Ghorman's single-product economy was severely injured by a temporary Imperial embargo.<ref name="Ever Been to Ghorman?">{{Andor|Ever Been to Ghorman?}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Carro Rylanz]], the leader of the [[Ghorman Front]], while attempting to recruit [[Syril Karn]], mentioned his belief that the Emperor had no idea that the persecution of Ghorman was occurring and that the ISB was operating a shadow government in his name.<ref name="I Have Friends Everywhere">{{Andor|I Have Friends Everywhere}}</ref> Sometime after this, intrigued by the results obtained by ISB interrogator Doctor [[Gorst]], [[Imperial Intelligence|Military Intelligence]] convinced the Emperor to expand him into a full-fledged program to be jointly maintained by a number of military and intelligence branches. However, Gorst and his work was soon destroyed by agents of the [[Axis network]] before the program could be put to use.<ref name="What a Festive Evening">{{Andor|What a Festive Evening}}</ref>

=====The Ghorman Massacre=====

In [[2 BBY]],<ref name="Dawn of Rebellion date">''[[Dawn of Rebellion]]'' dates the events of ''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]'' seventeen [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Mission to Mustafar|end]] of the [[Clone Wars]], which ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates to [[19 BBY]]; therefore, the events of ''Steps Into Shadow'' must take place in [[2 BBY]].</ref> the Emperor promoted the Chiss Imperial Navy officer Thrawn to the position of [[Grand Admiral]] for his role in [[Batonn insurgency|suppressing]] the [[Batonn insurgents|rebel insurgency]] in the [[Batonn sector]].<ref name="Steps Into Shadow">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]''</ref> During the promotion, however, Thrawn questioned Sidious on the practicality of the Death Star. The Emperor questioned if the reason for Thrawn's worries were because of the threat the station posed to the Chiss species. However, because Thrawn had fulfilled his end of the bargain by sharing his information on the Unknown Regions, he let the issue go. The Emperor then introduced Thrawn to his personal enforcer, Darth Vader.<ref name="Thrawn" /> Shortly after his promotion, Thrawn was dispatched to deal with the growing rebel threat at the request of Governor [[Arihnda Pryce]] and Tarkin.<ref name="Steps Into Shadow" /> 

The same year, ISB Major Partagaz informed Supervisor Meero that the Emperor was greatly interested in the Ghorman project and was currently meeting with Director Krennic. Partagaz told her that their orders were for her to begin implementing<ref name="Messenger">{{Andor|Messenger}}</ref> the original plan discussed a year prior<ref name="One Year Later" /> with the Major assuring Dedra that achieving success on Ghorman would ensure the ISB's importance to the Emperor in the future.<ref name="Messenger" /> Shortly thereafter, Meero oversaw the commencement of the operation. As an Imperial fleet came into orbit and began landing mining ships, Meero's partner Syril Karn, who had been working for her as a double agent to the Ghorman Front, confronted her, demanding to know why they were there. She revealed the secret she had long kept from him: the suppression of Ghorman in order to mine a mineral needed for the Emperor's energy program. As the situation with the local population deteriorated, the ISB and Imperial military implemented their plan to justify the Empire's actions on Ghorman by inciting a protest by the Ghor and then instigating violence by having a sniper shoot a junior Imperial officer. Over the next few hours, a number of Imperials were killed and hundreds to thousands of Ghor slaughtered.<ref name="Who Are You?">{{Andor|Who Are You?}}</ref> 

[[File:Secret_Cargo.jpg|thumb|250px|After a generation in power, Sidious' rule was challenged by the Alliance to Restore the Republic.]]The next day, Senator Mon Mothma met with her colleague Bail Organa, expressing her need to speak out against the Emperor's complicity in the [[Ghorman Massacre]], as much as she was now uncertain what more Palpatine was truly capable of doing. They both attended the early session of the Senate that was called where a strict agenda was scheduled. To circumvent this, using the time to speak ceded him by another Senator, Organa yielded the floor to Mothma in order to allow her to speak. As he did so, Organa cited an article, first proposed by the Emperor's Council, which allowed such an action in the case of an emergency. Mothma proceeded to give a speech to the Senate denouncing Emperor Palpatine, calling him a monster and decrying the massacre on Ghorman as an act of unprovoked genocide. The ISB managed to shut down the Senate broadcast midway through her speech and failed in their attempt to take her into custody.<ref name="Welcome to the Rebellion">{{Andor|Welcome to the Rebellion}}</ref> 

After her escape from Coruscant, Mothma gave another speech on the HoloNet, calling the Emperor a lying executioner who had ordered the attacks on Ghorman and stating that such evil could not be allowed to stand. Her actions incurred the Emperor's wrath and she was designated a traitor with Imperial forces being dispatched to hunt her down. Despite the efforts of Grand Admiral Thrawn to trap Mon Mothma and the [[Spectres]] in the [[Archeon Nebula]], [[Hera Syndulla]] managed to deliver Mon Mothma safely to [[Dantooine]] where she gave a third [[Declaration of the Rebel Alliance|speech]] urging the galaxy to rise up against the Empire. This marked the official formation of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]].<ref name="Secret Cargo">{{Rebels|Secret Cargo}}</ref>

=====Disturbance in the Unknown Regions=====
After Thrawn's [[Battle of Atollon|defeat]] at [[Atollon]], Sidious sensed a great disturbance in the Force somewhere on the edge of the galaxy. Therefore, the Emperor summoned Thrawn and Vader to Coruscant for a meeting. During the meeting, the Emperor ordered the two to the planet Batuu to locate a disturbance in the Force that he had sensed, testing Vader on his vulnerability to his past and Thrawn on his loyalty.<ref name="Thrawn: Alliances">''[[Thrawn: Alliances]]''</ref>

====Machinations on Lothal====
=====A World Between Worlds=====

[[File:Wolves-and-a-door-06_321d4477.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Emperor consulted with Minister Hydan regarding the ancient runes of the Mortis Gods.]]
The next year,<ref name="Target Vader Date">''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]'' dates the events of ''Star Wars: Target Vader'' to [[1 BBY]].</ref> during Vader's hunt for the [[Hidden Hand]], the Emperor contacted his apprentice through a hologram, expressing his disappointment in his failure to track down the criminal syndicate. He stated that they must be crushed at once, as they stole weapons from the Empire and supplied them to the Rebellion.<ref name="Target Vader 1">[[Target Vader 1|''Target Vader'' 1]]</ref>

After the discovery of a [[Lothal Jedi Temple|Jedi temple]] on Lothal, the Emperor directed [[Minister]] [[Veris Hydan]] to excavate the ruins and uncover its secrets. Sometime thereafter, the Emperor was contacted by Hydan, who informed him that they had reached the roots of the temple and uncovered a [[Painting of the Mortis gods|mural of the Mortis gods]], which was reminiscent of art and iconography found at the former temple on Coruscant. The Emperor told Hydan that he had sensed that the death of Jarrus had altered the fate of Lothal. Vowing to control the conduit between the living and the dead, the Emperor urged his minister to quicken the pace of his work.<ref name="Wolves and a Door">{{Rebels|Wolves and a Door}}</ref>

Later, the Emperor used [[Sith alchemy]] in an attempt to open a portal to the [[World Between Worlds]] where Bridger and Tano were. The Emperor taunted them through the portal and unleashed his power against them, which they were able to hold back. He then caught Bridger's leg and pulled him so that he could get through the portal. However, before he could get through the portal to enter the realm, Tano cut the [[Fiery energy|fiery]] [[lasso]]. The Emperor then tried again but failed as Bridger and Tano made it back to their world much to his fury. In the process, the Lothal Jedi Temple was destroyed.<ref name="A World Between Worlds" />

=====Deception on Lothal=====
{{Quote|My dear boy, it's you who chose to destroy the Temple. The actions of your Rebel friends require a firm hand to ensure that there is order on Lothal. As for your parents, allow me to offer what might have been, and what yet may be.|Darth Sidious, to Ezra Bridger|<ref name="FRAF">{{Rebels|Family Reunion &ndash; and Farewell}}</ref>}}
Following the [[Skirmish against the Third Fleet|defeat]] of the treasonous Grand Admiral [[Balanhai Savit]] and Thrawn losing the funding for his TIE defender program to the Death Star, Sidious spoke with his Chiss Grand Admiral over his private communications display to determine if his loyalties truly lied with the Empire, as Thrawn had worked with members of the Chiss Ascendancy to combat a [[Grysk Hegemony]] force that had infiltrated Imperial space. After confirming with Thrawn that Savit had in fact been a traitor, the Emperor turned the topic of discussion to the Chiss officer's loyalties, though Thrawn insisted that his work with the Ascendancy was not treason. Thrawn admitted that the Grysks were primarily a threat to his own people, but he argued that they had taken an interest in the Empire and could want control of the Death Star, which Sidious instantly denied, telling Thrawn that neither the Grysks nor the Chiss would control his station.<ref name="Thrawn: Treason">''[[Thrawn: Treason]]''</ref>

While Thrawn denied seeking the battle station for his people and promised to fight against such a situation, Sidious clearly saw the Chiss's divided loyalties. Pondering Thrawn's true allegiances and the other factors at play, Sidious wondered if an alliance between the Empire and the Ascendancy could be useful if Thrawn was correct. However, in such a case, Sidious wanted control of both governments and pondered if Thrawn could be manipulated or persuaded into betraying his kind. Deciding such a possibility required additional meditation and turning his attention to the more urgent matter of the Lothal rebels, Sidious informed Thrawn that he was sending instructions for a chamber to be built aboard the ''[[Chimaera]]''. He ordered Thrawn to put down the rebel insurgency on Lothal and bring Bridger to the chamber,<ref name="Thrawn: Treason" /> which was a portion of the Lothal Jedi Temple he wanted brought aboard "stone by stone."<ref name="FRAF" /> Leaving Thrawn to carry out his duties, he gave the Grand Admiral one last order: once the [[Liberation of Lothal|battle at Lothal]] was over, he was to return to Coruscant so they could have a "long ''long'' talk."<ref name="Thrawn: Treason" />

[[File:Palpatine_family-reunion.jpg|thumb|250px|A disguised Darth Sidious sought to use the Jedi Ezra Bridger to gain access to the World Between Worlds.]]
Fulfilling his orders,<ref name="Thrawn: Treason" /> Thrawn brought Bridger aboard the ''Chimaera'' when, in order to stop the Chiss officer from bombarding Lothal's [[Capital City]], the young Jedi surrendered himself to the Empire. After the officer and the Padawan talked about the fate of the Jedi and Lothal, Thrawn brought Ezra to the room that contained the temple portion, bringing Bridger face-to-face with the Galactic Emperor. Since the Emperor was off world, he used a hologram projection to present himself in his more benevolent, pre-scarred form. Sidious then ordered Thrawn to leave the room, leaving him alone with Bridger and the temple fragment.<ref name="FRAF" />

In an attempt to get Ezra to unlock the [[portal]] to the World Between Worlds, Sidious tried to tempt Ezra with the opportunity of reuniting with his deceased parents. Ezra, however, recalling his earlier lesson in the World Between Worlds, decided to reject this offer, knowing he had a family and then proceeded to pull down the Temple into rubble. This caused the Emperor's hologram projection to shift from his benevolent persona to his true form. With his plan in tatters, the Emperor ordered three members of the Royal Guard and three stormtroopers to enter the room and execute Ezra. However, after Sidious deactivated his hologram, Bridger was able to use the Force to crush the soldiers with rubble and escaped. Ultimately making his way to the bridge of the ''Chimaera'', Bridger, having previously ordered his ally [[Mart Mattin]] to summon a pod of [[Purrgil]] with [[Frequency Zero]], successfully liberated his homeworld from the Empire, as the creatures defeated the blockade in orbit and proceeded to take hold of the ''Chimaera'', dragging it, Thrawn, the rest of the crew, and him into hyperspace. Thus, Bridger unknowingly also stopped<ref name="FRAF" /> Sidious' future plans for Thrawn<ref name="Thrawn: Treason" /> from becoming a reality.<ref name="FRAF" />

===Galactic Civil War===
====The dissolution of the Senate====
{{Quote|The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.''"<br />"''That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?''"<br />"''The regional governors now have direct control over their territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line.

[[File:Emperor_Sidious.png|thumb|left|224px|Sidious further tightened his grip on the galaxy, confident that control could be maintained by fear.]]
Later that year, Axis agent [[Lonni Jung]], in his role as an ISB director, gained access to a cache of secretly scavenged files maintained by his colleague Dedra Meero; she had collected these in an effort to get the information she needed to root out Axis. Jung discovered evidence that the Emperor's energy program was a cover for the development of a super weapon being secretly constructed by Orson Krennic and was killed after passing on the information to Axis. However, Jung's viewing of Meero's files was uncovered and his body found.<ref name="Make It Stop">{{Andor|Make It Stop}}</ref> Krennic arrived on Coruscant to investigate Meero, meeting with Major Lio Partagaz who defended her, pointing out how miraculous it was that the secret had been kept as long as it had. Krennic commented that they were only a few tests away from successful completion but Partagaz retorted that he should tell that to Palpatine.<ref name="Who Else Knows?" /> The information about the Emperor's project was ultimately passed on to [[Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service|Rebel Intelligence]] agent Captain [[Cassian Jeron Andor|Cassian Andor]] and through him the leadership of the Rebel Alliance.<ref name="Who Else Knows?" /><ref name="Jedha, Kyber, Erso">{{Andor|Jedha, Kyber, Erso}}</ref>

Around the same time, having deliberately placed a trap inside the Death Star, [[scientist]] [[Galen Walton Erso]] dispatched pilot [[Bodhi Rook]] to [[Jedha]] to meet with Saw Gerrera's Partisans and inform the Rebel Alliance of the existence of the planet-killing superweapon. Fearing that the Imperial Senate would learn of the Death Star's existence, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin decided to test the Death Star's superlaser on [[Jedha City]], killing the traitorous pilot and proving that the station worked. Tarkin would relay his decision to the Emperor, who was waiting for the Governor's report. Director Krennic, however, expressed disappointment that neither the Emperor nor his favored emissary, Darth Vader, would be present for the occasion. This prompted Tarkin to explain that their absence served as a protection for Krennic should another failure occur during the testing of the weapon. Despite the animosity between the commanders, the Death Star fired on Jedha City, [[Destruction of Jedha City|destroying]] it within moments. Soon after, Krennic asked Tarkin if he would report to the Emperor that his efforts had paid off, only for Tarkin to reveal that he would instead inform the Emperor that he would be taking executive control of the Death Star.<ref name="Rogue One">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>

Not long after, [[Rogue One]] [[squad]], led by [[Jyn Erso]] and Captain Cassian Andor, as well as a large portion of the Alliance's fleet managed to steal a [[Death Star plans|complete technological readout]] of the Death Star from an [[Imperial Center of Military Research|Imperial Research Facility]] on Scarif. This loss, as the space station neared completion, was a bitter, and potentially fatal, blow to the Emperor's long-term plans. In order to deal with the problem, Sidious sent Vader to retrieve the Death Star plans.<ref name="Rogue One" />

Vader destroyed the [[Profundity|rebel flagship]] and much of the [[Raddus' task force|rebel fleet]]. However, the plans were retrieved by [[Toshma Jefkin]] and had escaped aboard the ''[[Tantive IV]]'', a [[CR90 corvette]], in the hands of Princess Leia, the Imperial Senator for Alderaan and a suspected Rebel sympathizer.<ref name="Rogue One" /> Vader soon trapped the corvette over Tatooine, boarding the ship and taking the Princess as a hostage. Although Vader failed to acquire the plans, he arrested Organa as a traitor and, as such, provided Sidious with the excuse he needed to dissolve the Imperial Senate. One of the last remnants of the Galactic Republic, Sidious had always planned to remove it but he needed to wait for the Death Star to be completed so that order could be maintained through fear instead of representation in the Senate. With the space station nearly completed and a Senator accused of supporting the rebellion, Sidious ordered the dissolution of the Senate. Legislative power was transferred to regional governors and select members of the [[Imperial Military|Imperial military]], such as Sidious' ally, Grand Moff Tarkin, allowing the Emperor to gain complete control over the Empire with no checks to his power.<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="Darth Vader 1">[[Darth Vader (2015) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 1]]</ref>

[[File:Exds.png|thumb|240px|The Emperor's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, was destroyed by Luke Skywalker during the Battle of Yavin.]]
After [[Rescue of Princess Leia|Vader's duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi]], Vader reported to Sidious the death of Kenobi, to Sidious' surprised glee. However, he was still troubled by Kenobi's last words, his body's disappearance upon death, and the still-mysterious whereabouts of Yoda. Sidious resolved to keep the Empire strong and to destroy the Rebellion.<ref name="Palpatine">{{StoryCite|story=Palpatine (short story)|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

Despite Sidious' careful planning for seizing complete power over the Empire, his plans were jeopardized when the Rebel Alliance launched an attack on the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin. As the Death Star was about to fire, Sidious sensed a disturbance in the Force, merely a blink from his point of view. In that moment, the Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker launched his proton torpedoes, succeeding in destroying the Death Star, killing Tarkin and most of the Empire's high-ranking officers, while also leaving Sidious concerned of the pilot's connection to the Force even though he wasn't as powerful as Maul or Dooku but just a simple boy.<ref name="Disturbance">{{StoryCite|story=Disturbance|book=From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back}}</ref>

The only survivors were Sidious' apprentice, Darth Vader, who had failed to defend the space station and Generals [[Hurst Romodi]] and [[Cassio Tagge]], the latter of whom had been sent to investigate Princess Leia Organa's claims about an active Rebel base on Dantooine. The Rebels' victory at Yavin was followed by another [[Assault on Cymoon|victory]] on [[Cymoon 1]], where a Rebel team destroyed the Empire's main production facility, [[Weapons Factory Alpha]]. Several other assaults by Rebel forces, such as the bombing of a supply base on [[Imdaar]] and the shipyards at [[Kuat]], harassed the Empire in the weeks following the Death Star's destruction. In addition, the aftermath of the Death Star's destruction saw a rise in pirate activity against Imperial supply convoys as the galactic government was no longer seen as invulnerable. The Empire's hold over vital worlds also began to slip; one of the worlds which began to question Imperial domination was the mining world of [[Shu-Torun]]. Ruled by a mercantile nobility called the [[ore-duke]]s, Shu-Torun provided important materials the Empire required for its construction projects, including the development of the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]], and the Emperor constantly demanded higher tithes, especially in the aftermath of the Battle of Yavin. Opposing this unsustainable increase, the Ore-dukes convinced their aged [[Unidentified King of Shu-Torun|King]] to rebel against the Empire.<ref name="Darth Vader 1" /><ref name=":Star Wars 4">[[Star Wars (2015) 4|''Star Wars'' (2015) 4]]</ref><ref name="Darth Vader 2">[[Darth Vader (2015) 2|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 2]]</ref><ref name="Darth Vader Annual 1">[[Darth Vader Annual 1|''Darth Vader Annual'' 1]]</ref>

[[File:PalpatineVaderCylo-2015DarthVader1.jpg|thumb|left|320px|In the wake of Darth Vader's failures, Sidious opted to test his apprentice, withholding information about an elusive ally of the Empire.]]
Determined to prevent the destruction of his Empire, Sidious reorganized Imperial High Command by appointing General Tagge as [[Grand General]] with command of all military matters. Tagge had argued against the strategy of having the Death Star as the Imperial military's sole weapon, believing that the military was all that was needed to safeguard the Empire and that depending on a single weapon was inviting catastrophe. Vader, who had failed to protect either the Death Star or Cymoon 1, was demoted and ordered to serve under Tagge as the Grand General saw fit. The Emperor gave orders that the military was to focus its attention on the conquest of the Outer Rim until the time when the second Death Star was completed. Tagge and Vader begun targeting the pirates for destruction as well as cracking down on criminal elements which had gone unchecked in the past, such as the [[Son-tuul Pride]].<ref name="Darth Vader 1" /><ref name="Darth Vader 2" /><ref name="Darth Vader 7">[[Darth Vader (2015) 7|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 7]]</ref>

The only ones spared the Empire's wrath were the [[Hutt]]s, who had entered into an alliance with the Empire. Needing raw materials for Imperial military production and knowing that the Hutts could provide them for the right price, Sidious [[Assault on Cymoon#Aftermath|sent]] Vader to Tatooine to negotiate an agreement with Jabba for their support in exchange for the Hutts being allowed to maintain their power base in the Outer Rim and the underworld. The destruction of competitors, such as the Son-tuul Pride, also allowed the Hutts to profit from the alliance as their position in the underworld fell to them.<ref name="Darth Vader 7" />

When Shu-Torun rose up in [[Shu-Torun War|open rebellion]] against the Empire following Darth Vader's brutal suppression of an assassination attempt made against him by the King, Sidious sent his apprentice back to the mining world with a large military force at his command. His orders were to end the Ore-dukes' rebellion and preserve the Imperial-backed government led by Queen [[Trios]], whom Vader had placed on the [[Monarch of Shu-Torun|throne]] after her father's treason.<ref name="Darth Vader Annual 1" /><ref name="Darth Vader 16">[[Darth Vader (2015) 16|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 16]]</ref>

At some point following the Battle of Yavin, the Emperor's luxury yacht ''Imperialis'' was [[Theft of the Imperialis|stolen]] by the gambler [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]] and his [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian's crew|associates]] while it was undergoing repairs at [[Sienar Fleet Systems]]' [[Orbital Shipyard CC-24]] above the planet [[Castell]]. Grand Vizier Amedda informed the Emperor of this loss within a [[Emperor's throne room (Coruscant)|Coruscant throne room]].<ref name="Lando 1">[[Lando 1|''Lando'' 1]]</ref> In response, the Emperor dispatched three Star Destroyers commanded by [[Commodore]] [[Idel]], [[Captain]] [[Shan]], and Captain [[Conro]] to recover his ship. These Star Destroyers destroyed CC-24 to punish the base's Commander [[Pasqual]] for failing to protect the Emperor's property. After the Star Destroyers failed to recover the ship, the Emperor dispatched the bounty hunter [[Chanath Cha]] to recover the vessel. Should she fail to recover it, he instructed her to destroy the ''Imperialis'' to avoid letting its secrets fall into the hands of others.<ref name="Lando 2">[[Lando 2|''Lando'' 2]]</ref> Unwilling to harm her former friends Lando and [[Lobot]], Chanath opted to destroy the vessel instead.<ref name="Lando 5">[[Lando 5|''Lando'' 5]]</ref> The wreckage of the ''Imperialis'' eventually ended up on [[Quantxi]], the junk moon of Ord Mantell.<ref name="Aftermath: Life Debt" />

====The Cylo Initiative====

=====Eliminating the competition=====
{{Quote|I was intrigued by the scientists. What could they achieve if unfettered by the hypocritical morality of the Old Republic? We would see. For is it not my duty to chart the possibilities? [&hellip;] Cylo grew powerful. His tendrils were deep in Tarkin's Initiative. His cancer was one with its flesh. If I simply tore him free, I would risk a schism of the Empire's great minds. While the Death Star was being constructed, that was unthinkable. After its destruction, it was even more so. I had to make him overplay his hand.|Darth Sidious, to Darth Vader|<ref name="Darth Vader 20" />}}
In the aftermath of Darth Vader's failure to prevent the Death Star's destruction, Sidious was approached by one of the scientists involved in the [[Tarkin Initiative]]: Doctor Cylo. One of the specialists who had saved Vader's life after sustaining his fatal injuries on Mustafar, Sidious had kept him on and funded his research into upgrading organic species into cybernetically-enhanced subjects. Cylo believed that organisms could only survive by adapting with technology and eliminating weaknesses. He also believed that in the new world he foresaw, the Force would be rendered obsolete. Although Sidious dismissed these thoughts by saying that everything was of the Force, he was curious to see what these scientists could do unconstrained by the presence of the Old Republic or the Jedi.<ref name="Darth Vader 20" /><ref name="Darth Vader 5">[[Darth Vader (2015) 5|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 5]]</ref><ref name="Vader 6">[[Darth Vader (2015) 6|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 6]]</ref>

[[File:StarWarsDarthVader20.jpg|thumb|300x330px|More tests laid for Vader in the tumultuous time of the Galactic Civil War, as he struggled under his manipulative Sith Master, Darth Sidious.]]
During the twenty years which had passed since the end of the Clone Wars, Cylo had worked to create several [[Whale-ship|subjects]] which possessed the best genetic and cybernetic upgrades that he could provide, preparing them as potential enforcers for the Empire. With Vader's disgrace clear and the Emperor's need for strong elements to prevent further damage being done to the Empire, Cylo suggested that he replace his apprentice with one of his subjects. Vader's role would be reduced to a ceremonial one, while the doctor's subjects would enforce Sidious' will throughout the galaxy. Intrigued by Cylo's proposition, Sidious agreed to provide his subjects with a chance to impress him.<ref name="Darth Vader 5" /><ref name="Vader 6" />

However, unbeknownst to the scientist, the Emperor had come to believe that Cylo had grown too powerful as a result of his involvement with the Tarkin Initiative. At the time, Sidious could do nothing about it because of the doctor's connection with several of the Empire's greatest scientific minds meant that removing him could lead to dissension among them. When Cylo presented him his plan, however, Sidious knew that he could cause him to overplay his hand which would make him a traitor to the Empire. Knowing that Vader would be the perfect foil to Cylo's subjects, the Emperor made sure the two men met. The day he informed Vader of his punishment for his failure at the Imperial Palace on Coruscant, he also summoned Cylo for a private meeting. When his apprentice asked who the scientist was, Sidious refused to answer him, leading Vader to conduct his own investigation into the Emperor's secrets.<ref name="Darth Vader 20" /><ref name="Darth Vader 1" />

After Vader's hired bounty hunter [[Krrsantan]] successfully apprehended Cylo in his fourth body, he revealed under torture the location of his [[Cylo's base|secret research base]]. The Sith Lord made his way to the base where he began an [[Skirmish in Cylo's research base|assault]] to find his potential rivals and destroy them. However, Cylo-IV's death at the hands of Vader's torture droid [[0-0-0]] had not killed the scientist: having recreated himself as an immortal system, whenever one of Cylo's bodies died, another was activated on board his research base. Cylo-V had guessed that Vader had discovered the location of his base and that he would be coming when he was activated. As such, he contacted the Emperor so that he could give him a demonstration of his subjects. Sidious arrived as Vader was about to kill the scientist. Only his intervention saved Cylo-V from suffering his predecessor's fate. With all the elements for his plan to begin, the Emperor demanded Cylo start the presentation.<ref name="Darth Vader 4">[[Darth Vader (2015) 4|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 4]]</ref><ref name="Darth Vader 5" />

[[File:BlasphemyForceItself-2015DarthVader5.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Darth Sidious turned to Cylo and his experiments in a bid to test his apprentice.]]
As they fought with Vader, Cylo presented to him the subjects that he had been working on over the past twenty years: [[Aiolin Astarte]] and [[Morit Astarte]], twins born to a [[Astarte line|family]] which had supported the Separatists during the Clone Wars, who had been upgraded genetically and cybernetically to possess abilities similar to the Jedi and Sith of old without having to use the Force; [[Tulon Voidgazer]], a genius scientist involved with high-level R&D development before she was upgraded with a cloud of drone-droids, connected directly to her brain, who allowed her to see and fight through them; Commander [[Karbin]], a Mon Calamari veteran of the Clone Wars who had spent eighteen years on life support after his ship crashed, and who had been upgraded into a model resembling the late General Grievous and trained in lightsaber combat. Finally, Cylo had created a system which could possess various hosts, tested on a [[Unidentified Trandoshan (Cylo-V's warrior)|Trandoshan]], and remove any traits the Emperor would not desire, such as pain and emotions. Sufficiently impressed, Sidious demanded a real demonstration of their abilities. Vader and the subjects began to fight to the death against one another, and the [[Trandoshan]] was killed by Morit before the Emperor called a stop to the fight. He announced that he would find a use for every one of them, but that only one would win a place as his enforcer. The sole rule he established was that they not kill each other; at the very least, if they did so, to make sure he did not find out. As he prepared to leave, the Emperor called Vader to speak to him privately.<ref name="Vader 6" />

=====A worthy apprentice=====
{{Quote|Do not underestimate how much you disappointed me on Mustafar. I saved you, but you showed how much off the mark you fell. [&hellip;] The dark side is strength. If they defeat you, they are stronger. If you defeat them, you prove you are. This is the way of the Sith. I named you "Vader" after you pledged yourself to the Sith. You proved yourself worthy of it then. I am certain you will prove yourself worthy now.|Darth Sidious|<ref name="Vader 6" />}}
[[File:EmperorsSubjects-2015DarthVader6.png|thumb|250px|Relations were tense between Sidious' subjects.]]
When they were alone, Sidious complimented Vader on his ability to discover Cylo's project. He was also impressed with his apprentice's ability to act beyond his knowledge, and how he had been able to [[Secret mission to Geonosis|acquire]] a private army of [[BX-series droid commando|Separatist-era commando droids]] to use for his own ends. Vader was displeased with being forced to prove himself against Cylo's subjects, especially as he considered them blasphemous to the ways of the Force. Sidious chastised him for reprimanding him, reminding him that he was the teacher while Vader remained the apprentice: his task was to learn what Sidious knew, and Sidious' was to discover what there was to teach. The Emperor also revealed that he needed Vader to overcome the disappointment he had caused in him when he almost fell on Mustafar, and prove himself worthy of carrying the name Sidious had given him when he had pledged himself to the Sith. With his business concluded, the Emperor left Cylo's base and returned to Coruscant.<ref name="Vader 6" />

At the Emperor's directive, Cylo's subjects were placed at Grand General Tagge's disposal, while the doctor acted as a consultant for the military. The rivalry between them and Vader eventually led to the [[Battle of Vrogas Vas|confrontation]] with the Rebel Alliance on [[Vrogas Vas]]. As a result of Karbin's manipulation, Vader crashed on Vrogas Vas when he confronted three Rebel squadrons. One pilot chose to crash his X-Wing into Vader's TIE fighter to bring him down. On the surface, Vader confronted a large force or Rebel soldiers assembled by Leia Organa to eliminate his threat. The confrontation culminated in a battle between the Sith Lord and Karbin, which resulted in the latter's death. The Rebellion suffered important losses on Vrogas Vas, and Karbin's disappearance led the Emperor to search for him. Vader eventually made his way to Coruscant where he presented his master with Karbin's corpse. Although Sidious was annoyed that his apprentice had violated his rule, he was impressed when Vader challenged him to provide him with another way to prove himself worthy of his trust. The Emperor gave his apprentice command of the military force he was sending to Shu-Torun to preserve Queen Trios's hold on the [[throne]]. However, he also sent Cylo and his remaining subjects, apparently on Grand General Tagge's request. Before Vader left the Imperial Palace, Sidious warned him not to disappoint him, as he relied on him more than he let on.<ref name="Darth Vader 16" />

Vader's campaign on Shu-Torun was a success, and the rebellious Ore-dukes were brought down. In the middle of the battle, Cylo attempted to have his rival killed by forming an alliance with Baron [[Rubix]], the leader of the Shu-Torun rebels. Vader evaded the trap and, with the help of a dying Aiolin Astarte who had been betrayed by her brother, secured the proof needed to prove the doctor's treachery from her memory circuit. Once Vader's business was concluded on Shu-Torun, he informed the Emperor of Cylo's betrayal and told him that he had fled with his remaining subjects. Pleased that his plan had worked, Sidious summoned Vader to him on the shipyard where the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Executor]]'' was being built.<ref name="Darth Vader 17">[[Darth Vader (2015) 17|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 17]]</ref><ref name="Darth Vader 18">[[Darth Vader (2015) 18|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 18]]</ref><ref name="Darth Vader 19">[[Darth Vader (2015) 19|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 19]]</ref><ref name="Darth Vader 20" />

=====End of Games=====
{{Quote|The fleet will be yours. The ''Executor'' will be yours. I leave you to educate your subordinates about this brave new era.|Darth Sidious, to Darth Vader|<ref name="Darth Vader 25">[[Darth Vader (2015) 25|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 25]]</ref>}}
[[File:VaderEmperorMeeting-2015DarthVader21.png|thumb|left|250px|Vader destroyed Doctor Cylo and his creations in order to safeguard his position as Darth Sidious' apprentice.]]
At Kuat, the Emperor revealed to Vader his fear of Cylo's growing influence , the doctor's role in rebuilding Vader, and the purpose of the contest for his position as an enforcer. Vader recognized that, should one of his rivals had been the last one standing, the Emperor would be having the same conversation with them. However, he declared that he had succeeded and that he represented the strength of the dark side. Sidious was pleased with his apprentice's success and ordered him to find Cylo and destroy him.<ref name="Darth Vader 20" />

While the ''Executor'' was still under construction, Cylo's fleet [[Cylo Hijacking|attacked]] the dreadnought. During the assault, one of his creations, Tulon Voidgazer sabotaged the vessel. Sidious contacted Tagge, demanding to know what was happening, however the general and his crew were knocked unconscious by toxic gas. The Emperor was then informed by one of his guards that they were trapped.<ref name="DV 22">[[Darth Vader (2015) 22|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 22]]</ref>

After Vader killed Cylo's minions and destroyed his current body, he informed the Emperor of his success. Pleased with his apprentice, Sidious told him to finish his mission then return. At that moment, the [[archaeologist]] Doctor [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]] entered his private chambers. She then claimed they had a "mutual friend" and that she had things the Emperor needed to know.<ref name="Darth Vader 24">[[Darth Vader (2015) 24|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 24]]</ref>

After Vader finished off Cylo for good, he returned to his master. It was then that Sidious told Vader that Aphra had informed him of all of his secret endeavors, many of which had been technically treasonous. However, rather than chastise or punish Vader, the Emperor told his apprentice that he was impressed with his ambitions and that he was everything he could have hoped for. He then left Vader to deal with Aphra as he pleased. Due to Tagge's failure, the Emperor demoted him and transferred command of the ''Executor'' and its [[Death Squadron|fleet]] to Vader. Pleased with his apprentice, he left him to "educate" his subordinates of the future.<ref name="Darth Vader 25" />

{{Quote|The loss of the Death Star made the galaxy think they could rebel. This has shown that the Rebellion can ''never'' win."<br />"''Hmph''. It is...satisfactory.|Darth Vader and Darth Sidious|<ref name="SW 55" />}}
Sometime later, Sidious sought out Vader to speak with him and found his apprentice in a training room with [[Sergeant]] [[Kreel]] of [[Task Force 99]]. The trooper bowed and expressed his honor at meeting the Emperor, who said he expected as such and urged Vader to join him elsewhere.<ref name="SW 37">[[Star Wars (2015) 37|''Star Wars'' (2015) 37]]</ref>

Around [[1 ABY]],<ref name="Aphra 13 Date">{{Aphra2016Date|13}}</ref> Vader successfully obtained a kyber crystal containing the [[Eternal Rur|copied consciousness]] of an ancient Jedi named [[Rur]]. While reporting to Sidious on a successful raid against the criminal syndicates, he presented the artifact to a pleased Sidious, who added it to his collection, certain that the crystal and its occupant would be of value to him.<ref name="Aphra 13">[[Doctor Aphra (2016) 13|''Doctor Aphra'' (2016) 13]]</ref>

Later that year, Vader led Imperial forces to a decisive [[Battle of Mako-Ta|victory]] at the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]], virtually crippling the Rebel fleet. While Sidious pointed out that the enemy had not been completely destroyed, Vader contended that the Rebellion had been weakened such that it could not pose a major threat to the Empire anymore. He added that the Alliance could be wiped out at their convenience, which satisfied Sidious.<ref name="SW 55">[[Star Wars (2015) 55|''Star Wars'' (2015) 55]]</ref>

====The Skywalker problem====

=====Yoda and Sidious' visions=====
{{Quote|There is a great disturbance in the Force.''"<br />"''I have felt it.''"<br />"''We have a new enemy: the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star. I have no doubt this boy is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.|Darth Sidious and Darth Vader, about Luke Skywalker|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
In [[3 ABY]],<ref name="TESB Date">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the events of [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']] to [[3 ABY]].</ref> the Empire had managed to gain a [[Battle of Hoth|major victory]] by capturing the [[Echo Base|Rebel base]] on the ice planet of [[Hoth]].<ref name="Episode V" /> Around this time, the self-exiled Master Yoda went into the [[Cave of Evil]] on [[Dagobah]]. While inside, he experienced a [[Force vision]] in which he was attacked by the figures of many people he had failed, many of them Jedi, the most prominent being Dooku, [[Keeve Trennis]] and Anakin Skywalker, accusing him of leaving them to their fates. As Yoda began to sink into a pile of [[Bone|skulls]], a specter of Darth Sidious appeared, deriding Yoda for his blindness and mockingly calling the Jedi his greatest apprentice. However, in the vision, Yoda was also reminded of his own teaching about failure by a young [[Bree Menaren]]. With this insight, Yoda was able to cast off the bodies and bones around him and end the vision.<ref name="Yoda 10">[[Yoda 10|''Yoda'' 10]]</ref>

[[File:Threatofskywalker.png|thumb|277px|The Sith discovered a new threat to their reign in the form of Luke Skywalker, son of Anakin Skywalker and Jedi-to-be.]]
Around this time, while sitting within his [[Shrine in the Depths|secret shrine]], Sidious sensed a great disturbance in the Force. It was not unlike that which he had sensed within the moments before the Death Star's destruction. Sidious sought to see within the disturbance, which brought him to a vision of a boy holding a crimson lightsaber, having seemingly decapitated the Emperor's Royal Guards within his very own Imperial Office. As he watched, the boy approached a seated Sidious within the vision, calling to the Force to choke Sidious' doppelganger. The doppelganger attempted to electrocute the boy with Force Lightning, but failed to stop him. Following this, the doppelganger tried to call upon his lightsaber but instead the boy commanded it and turned the saber on midflight, eventually overpowering the doppelganger when the Sith Lord's own saber struck him down.<ref name="Disturbance" />

A familiar voice then called to the boy, who proceeded to walk to the same spot the real Sidious now occupied. The boy knelt in front of the hidden figure as the voice noted that the boy had done well. Sidious then realized who the voice belonged to: That of Anakin Skywalker. Sidious concluded that this must be a dream of Anakin's. Probing deeper within the vision, Sidious witnessed the scene of the unmasked and unburnt Anakin Skywalker walking beneath the sight of endless Star Destroyers, walking together with a figure that seemingly resembled him as well as the looming figure of the long deceased Senator Padme Amidala, now alive once more. The figure referred to Anakin as Father and to Padme as Mother. Anakin then motioned to the fleet, referring to the boy as Luke, stating that the fleet that flew above them was now the most powerful in the galaxy. Having witnessed this, Sidious was thrown out of the vision, but he had witnessed enough. From these pieces he deduced that Vader's prior actions made supposedly under the guise of destroying the Alliance leadership were actually motivated by a desire to find his son and shape him to his vision.<ref name="Disturbance" />

Sidious then resolved to give Vader the resources to do just that while waiting for Vader to make a mistake. When he made that mistake, Sidious would be ready to take advantage of it for his own purposes and ensuring Vader's simultaneous downfall.<ref name="Disturbance" /> With Darth Vader aboard his<ref name="Episode V" /> command ship,<ref name="Episode VI" /> ''Executor'',<ref name="Ozzel DB">{{Databank|admiral-ozzel|Admiral Ozzel}}</ref> the Emperor ultimately contacted the [[commanding officer]] of the vessel, [[Admiral]] Piett, telling him to have Lord Vader contact him immediately. Vader did as he was instructed and was told of his son, [[Luke Skywalker]],<ref name="Episode V" /> fully aware that Vader was knowledgeable of this information.<ref name="Disturbance" /> The Emperor then proceeded to state his desire for the elimination of this threat, yet Vader suggested that young Skywalker could become an ally. With calculated words of approval, the Emperor allowed his enforcer to pursue this possible "asset." The cloaked master then left Vader to find Luke Skywalker after his apprentice pledged to confront the offspring of Anakin Skywalker and either bring him to the Emperor or have his son destroyed.<ref name="Episode V" />

=====Vader's departure=====
{{Quote|Luke, you can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and together, we can rule the galaxy as father and son!|Darth Vader, to Luke Skywalker|<ref name="Episode V" />}}
Darth Vader eventually lured Luke Skywalker to [[Cloud City]] on [[Bespin]], where the Sith Lord attempted to capture Skywalker in [[Carbon-freezing|carbonite]] and transport the Jedi-aspirant to the Emperor. However, Skywalker evaded capture and was confronted by Vader in a [[duel on Cloud City]]. There, with the Jedi-aspirant beaten by a precarious ledge, Vader divulged knowledge of his relationship with Skywalker, his son, and gave an ultimatum for the youth: to join forces&mdash;as said to be [[destiny]]&mdash;with his father, Darth Vader, or die. However, Luke Skywalker rejected his newfound father, and allowed himself to fall into the [[Reactor shaft|abyss]].<ref name="Episode V" />

Having failed in recruiting or destroying Skywalker, Vader returned to the ''Executor'', only to be interrupted by its crew, which reported the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'s}} [[escape from Cloud City]]. Upon the ''Executor''{{'s}} bridge, Vader sensed the presence of his son aboard the ''Falcon''. Calling out for the young Skywalker to join himself in vain, the father of Skywalker watched as the ''Falcon'' slipped past Imperial forces with its fully functional hyperdrive.<ref name="Episode V" />

[[File:EmperorsThroneRoom-2020DarthVader1.png|thumb|left|300px|Following Vader's encounter with Skywalker, Sidious learned from Admiral Piett that Lord Vader had abruptly departed his fleet.]]
Angered, Lord Vader left his flagship aboard an Imperial shuttle with a [[ZED-6-7|forensics droid]] and a [[Darth Vader's guard|unit]] of [[death trooper]]s for revenge against those responsible for withholding the knowledge of his offspring's survival, altering the [[Forensics droid|droid's]] systems that would force its [[motivator]] to trigger a [[Self-destruct mechanism|self-destruct sequence]] should the droid reveal any information to anyone&mdash;including Imperials and the Emperor himself&mdash;regarding their quest.<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 1">[[Darth Vader (2020) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 1]]</ref>

Meanwhile, the Emperor had Grand Vizier Mas Amedda contact Admiral Piett by hologram. After Piett's confirmation on the escape of the ''Millennium Falcon'', the Grand Vizier relayed the Emperor's demand for Vader to contact him immediately, yet an officer alerted Piett of the departure of Lord Vader's shuttle as the admiral reached for his comlink to Vader. Cautiously wording his response, Piett told Vizier Amedda of Vader's unavailability. Hearing word of Vader's failure and his leave from Imperial command, the Emperor began to laugh before the holo-transmission of Piett while he sat on his [[Emperor's throne room (Imperial Palace)|throne]] in his palace on Coruscant as Amedda stood next to him.<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 1" />

At some point, Vader arrived at the Imperial Palace to meet with his master in the throne room, where Palpatine learned from his apprentice that the Rebel Navy was scattered but likely to [[Operation Starlight|regroup]] in the future. Unwilling to let the opportunity before them slip away, Sidious ordered his apprentice to lead the hunt to crush the Rebellion while it was scared and disorganized, believing that, without the likes of Thrawn nor Tarkin in the Empire, his apprentice would be one of the few who could lead the campaign. However, he himself admitted such a campaign would prevent Vader from carrying out the search for Skywalker, which both were eager to see continue. Vader thus suggested they give the mission to Tarkin's student [[Ellian Zahra]], which Palpatine agreed to.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 8">[[Star Wars (2020) 8|''Star Wars'' (2020) 8]]</ref>

With the assistance of [[Sabé]] and her [[Amidalans]], Vader eventually [[Battle on Polis Massa|discovered]] the true fate of his deceased wife, traveling to [[Polis Massa]] and viewing a recording of her final moments, during which she said there was still good in her husband. After uncovering this, Vader returned to his master on Coruscant. Upon his arrival, Sidious chastised his apprentice for wallowing in his grief. He then told Vader that he would have to start again with fear before attacking his apprentice with Force lightning.<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 5">[[Darth Vader (2020) 5|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 5]]</ref> In the ensuing struggle, Amedda revealed the Emperor's knowledge of Vader's failure to turn his son and collusion with the Amidalans. Vader was then attacked by the Emperor's guards before subduing them and Amedda with a Force choke. While impressed by Vader's strength, Sidious used the Force to crush Vader's limbs, telling him to forget everything but his master. With only his right arm remaining, Vader was told by Sidious that he would have to find himself again or die.<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 6" />

Accompanied by a pair of death troopers, Sidious returned Vader to Mustafar and left him on the very shore where he had found him. He then told his apprentice that he would have to rebuild himself without using the Force before leaving him to do so. Back on his shuttle, Sidious was informed by Amedda that Vader was heading for the ruins of the [[Klegger Corp Mining Facility|Techno Union installation]], which was filled with machinery that he would most likely use to rebuild himself and kill Sidious. To this, Sidious revealed his own plan; to remind Vader of his pain in order for him to build himself back up to power. For this purpose, he would send [[Ochi|Ochi of Bestoon]], a [[Sith assassin|Sith huntsman]] to hunt down his apprentice for sport, saying he would turn Vader's anger back to pain as many times as it took.<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 6" />

=====Confrontation on Exegol=====
{{Quote|Unlimited power. Beyond ''anything'' you have ever experienced. All in ''my'' hands. You feel it ''burning'' your flesh and mind. Ready to ''incinerate'' you in an instant. And you know you cannot fight it. So how&hellip;''how'' can you ''claim'' it?|Darth Sidious, to Darth Vader|<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 11">[[Darth Vader (2020) 11|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 11]]</ref>}}
However, much to Sidious' dismay, Vader fought off his assassin and discovered a [[Sith wayfinder]] which led the way to the hidden Sith world of [[Exegol]] in the Unknown Regions, where much of Sidious' spare power and resources were kept in reserve. Defeating an Imperial fleet and a [[Summa-verminoth]] guarding the planet, Vader reached Exegol with Ochi in tow. Stepping outside of his Sith Citadel, the Emperor was met by Ochi, who warned him of Vader's arrival. Looking up at his apprentice as he rode on the back of the Summa-verminoth, Sidious asked Vader what this experience had taught him, to which Vader replied that he would teach his master what it was to fear. Vader then rode the Summa-verminoth into battle, to which Sidious sent out two crustaceous creatures to attack the monster. Though the creatures were defeated, Sidious then used the Force to crush the Summa-verminoth himself, forcing Vader to return to ground level as Sidious went back inside the Citadel. As Vader and Ochi followed him inside, Sidious taunted his apprentice through the Force, explaining to him the horrors that he would find.<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 11" />

Within the Citadel were large vats containing [[Strand-Cast|bioengineered organisms]] strong in the dark side of the Force, along with countless Sith statues, beings known as [[Tanker (Exegol)|Tankers]], [[Sith cultist]]s and a jar containing the severed hand of Vader's son. Though these creations were not Sith, Sidious claimed that any one of them could replace Vader if he were to fall. After fighting his way through his master's monsters, Vader was followed by Ochi to one of the Citadel's lower levels. There, they discovered an entire fleet of star destroyers, each armed with a [[Axial superlaser|planet-destroying cannon]]. Just beyond this fleet was a massive dome filled with red light and piercing screams. Despite Ochi's attempts to dissuade him, Vader entered the dome and came upon his master's greatest secret; a subterranean mountain of kyber crystal, bled red by the Sith cultists who kept it in constant pain. Sidious explained that he did this in order to power the cannons of his fleet. When the crystal was cut, it screamed in pain and sent out a wave of power, knocking off Ochi's helmet and burning his unprotected eyes. Vader suffered as well as Sidious mocked him for attempting to claim his power. Sidious then told his apprentice that if he continued to walk with him, he would never escape his pain. But only by walking with him would he be able to share his master's power. When Sidious asked his apprentice if he had chosen, Vader replied "Yes, my master" before departing from Exegol along with Sidious, Ochi, Amedda and Sly Moore.<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 11" />

Among the chaos of these events, Sidious and the cultists were unaware that his son, by then known as "The Abomination," who had been wandering the Citadel and watching from afar, had escaped with the help his symeong slave friend [[Dathan (Symeong)|Dathan]] aboard the [[Darth Vader's green Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor|ship]] Vader had arrived with Ochi aboard,<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> escaping from Exegol to live a life away from the dark side of the Force and to shun his cruel Sith father, ultimately rejecting the ways of the Sith.<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" />

====The War against the Sith====

=====The threat of Crimson Dawn=====
{{Quote|Crimson Dawn has barely shown its strength. To get this far, it must have agents at every level throughout the Empire. Find these infiltrators, Lord Vader&hellip;and show them who is stronger.|Darth Sidious, to Darth Vader|<ref name="DV 2020 17">[[Darth Vader (2020) 17|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 17]]</ref>}}
Returning to Coruscant, Sidious brought Vader to the very facility where he had first been restored. As Vader was repaired once again, Amedda warned Sidious of his intentions to kill him. Sidious replied that with Vader now knowing the limits of his role, he would find a more appropriate target for his hate, assuring both Amedda and Moore that he was beyond Vader's reach and they were beneath his notice. Once Vader was repaired, he asked Sidious his will, to which Sidious told him to decide that for himself. Vader then called over Ochi, who had just been given a cybernetic visor so he could continue to see. After gaining the Emperor's approval, Ochi departed with Vader in a Lambda-class shuttle to begin their next assignment; killing Luke Skywalker.<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 12">[[Darth Vader (2020) 12|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 12]]</ref> Meanwhile Sidious asked Moore how she felt about Vader's restoration. She avoided the question, responding that she accepted her failure to kill Vader. Sidious laughed, never having expected her to succeed.<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 14">[[Darth Vader (2020) 14|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 14]]</ref>

Vader and Ochi's quest for Skywalker eventually led them to the [[Auction for Han Solo]] held by Lady [[Qi'ra]] of the newly reemerged crime syndicate [[Crimson Dawn]]. Vader retrieved the stolen smuggler from the auction on [[Jekara]] in order to lure Luke Skywalker to him. However, this move drew the ire of the Grand Hutt Council, who attacked the ''Executor'' to reclaim Jabba's prize from the Empire. While Vader engaged his son in a dogfight over the planet, Admiral Piett called Vader for assistance against the Hutt attack, to which Vader replied that the attack was not his concern. In turn, Piett contacted the Emperor himself to appraise him of the situation. Sidious then told the Admiral to inform Vader that eliminating the Hutt Council was his new priority. Vader conceded and allowed his son to escape before slaughtering the Hutt Council, ending their attack while Boba Fett retrieved his bounty from the ''Executor'' and brought him to [[Boba Fett's Palace|Jabba's Palace]] on Tatooine.<ref name="WOTBH 5">[[War of the Bounty Hunters 5|''War of the Bounty Hunters'' 5]]</ref> As Vader choked Moore on the ''Executor'' for betraying him, he was contacted by Sidious, to which he released his grip on the Umbaran and knelt before the Emperor. After restating his loyalty to his master, Vader was instructed by Sidious to hunt down and eliminate Crimson Dawn's agents within the Empire.<ref name="DV 2020 17" />

Sometime later, Vader and his followers returned to Coruscant and struck down all of the Royal Guards and aides in the Emperor's throne room. Unfazed by this, Sidious pointed out Vader should have kept one of them alive for questioning. When Vader asked him if they were loyal, Sidious said they were loyal to strength, which Vader showed them. However, only one of them was Crimson Dawn, meaning that Vader's list was flawed. When Sidious questioned if his apprentice already knew that to be the case, Vader hesitated before assuring his master that he would bring him order.<ref name="DV 2020 20">[[Darth Vader (2020) 20|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 20]]</ref> Stoked by attacks from Crimson Dawn, the most powerful syndicates in the criminal underworld, except for the Hutts, began to fight amongst themselves. Displeased with the growing [[Syndicate War]], Sidious ordered Amedda to contact his apprentice and inform him that his intervention was required.<ref name="Crimson Reign 1">[[Crimson Reign 1|''Crimson Reign'' 1]]</ref> As he returned to his throne room, the Emperor was informed by Amedda that the syndicates were allegedly vying for his favor. Sidious then decided to use his own fleet to quell their exuberance. But as he ordered Amedda to inform Piett and Veers, his entire Royal Guard suddenly [[Assassination of the Emperor's Royal Guard|fell over dead]] before him.<ref name="Crimson Reign 2">[[Crimson Reign 2|''Crimson Reign'' 2]]</ref>

=====The Queen's Shadow=====
{{Quote|You did ''well'' to bring her to me, Lord Vader. She could be quite an ''asset''. [...] With every ''moment'' she spends in your ''service you'' are molding ''her''. Go, then. And teach the ''Queen's Shadow'' how to serve the Empire.|Darth Sidious, to Darth Vader|<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 28">[[Darth Vader (2020) 28|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 28]]</ref>}}
In the course of his mission to wipe out Crimson Dawn, Vader joined Sabé on [[Gabredor III]] in order to save his childhood friends [[Kitster Banai|Kitster]] and [[Wald]] from Governor [[Tauntaza]], who was aligned with the criminal syndicate. After learning of this, Sidious was amused that, after failing to save his mother and wife, Vader would attempt the same for others from his early life.<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 26">[[Darth Vader (2020) 26|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 26]]</ref> Wearing a [[Tauntaza's armor|battlesuit]], Tauntaza engaged in combat with Vader, damaging his suit and fleeing the planet. After his recovery, Vader made Sabé his advisor and she determined that Tauntaza's actions had been at the command of the Emperor.<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 28" />

Thus, Vader returned to Coruscant with Sabé, bursting into the Emperor's throne room uninvited. Sidious stated that Vader had been listening to his heart and asked him what it had told him. In response, Vader levitated Sabé, ignoring her calling him by his original name. Sidious told her that referring to Vader as Anakin did the opposite of what she intended: instead of breaking through to him, she reminded him of his weakness. Despite her failure to turn his apprentice against him, Sidious was intrigued by her boldness, sending his Royal Guards to attack her. After she outfought them, even sending their fire towards him, Sidious killed them with Force lightning.<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 28" />

Impressed by her combat skills, Sidious spoke to Sabé about the darkness he sensed in her heart. When he asked why she wanted to kill him, she replied that he represented chaos, while Vader represented order. Sidious retorted that ''she'' brought chaos in her quest for order, telling her to be proud of it, saying that it was her strength. Pleased, Sidious told Vader not to let his history with Sabé and her resemblance to his dead wife trouble him, particularly since she could not hope to defeat him. Instead, Vader was to continue molding her as a servant of the Empire.<ref name="Darth Vader 2020 28" />

=====The Enemy of the Sith=====
{{Quote|Considering recent events ''Lord Vader''...something has become clear to me. We have...an ''enemy''."<br />"The ''Empire'' has many enemies, my master."<br />"Not the ''Empire'', my apprentice. The ''Sith''. [...] It is ''no coincidence'' that these events are happening at once, Lord Vader. They are part of a coordinated campaign of ''diversion''. Of ''distraction''.|Darth Sidious and Darth Vader|<ref name="Crimson Reign 5" />}}
[[File:VaderPalpatineDiscuss-CrimsonReign5.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious and Vader discussed the threat to the Sith.]]
Sometime later, Sidious summoned Vader back to his palace to discuss what he believed was a threat not to the Empire, but to the Sith themselves. He cited the Hutt attack on the ''Executor'', the Syndicate War, Commander Zahra's failure to eradicate the Rebel Alliance, the assassination of ten of his Royal Guards, and the theft of the [[Screaming Key]] from Fortress Vader by the [[Knights of Ren]] as evidence of a concerted conspiracy against them. When Vader asked who was behind the plot, the Emperor called in ISB Director [[Sliro Barsha|Barsha]] to lay out what intelligence he had uncovered about the Syndicate War and name their enemy to Vader. After explaining that the syndicates were fighting for the Emperor's favor after hearing a rumor that the Hutts were losing their arrangement with the Empire. He revealed that he had learned that Crimson Dawn was responsible for the rumor.<ref name="Crimson Reign 5">[[Crimson Reign 5|''Crimson Reign'' 5]]</ref>

Later, as the two Sith walked down a hallway, Sidious stated to Vader his belief that Crimson Dawn was also behind the other incidents. Sidious asked Vader to confirm that he had met and dueled the syndicate's leader, Lady Qi'ra. Vader acquiesced, remembering that it had taken place at the auction for Han Solo, which Sidious reminded him was another of his failures. As they discussed her combat skills, which Vader said went beyond [[Teräs Käsi]] and involved techniques that reminded him of Sidious, they both came to the conclusion that Qi'ra had been trained by Maul, with Sidious concerned that she may have learned more about the Sith than simply fighting forms.<ref name="Crimson Reign 5" />

=====The Hidden Empire=====
{{Quote|Wherever you are Emperor Sheev Palpatine, Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith...this is my ''Hidden Empire. Choke on it.''|Lady Qi'ra|<ref name="Hidden Empire 1" />}}
After the seeming destruction of Crimson Dawn, Sidious sent an Imperial party to recover the [[Spark Eternal]] from the [[Amaxine Space Station]]. However, it had merged with a [[Unidentified droid (Fermata Cage)|droid disc]] and the resultant [[Scourge|intelligence]] proceeded to possess the droids of the accompanying Star Destroyer and use them to kill everyone aboard.<ref name="Dark Droids 1">[[Dark Droids 1|''Dark Droids'' 1]]</ref> At some point that year, Rebel Intelligence confirmed that the Emperor and Darth Vader were aboard the ''Executor'' somewhere in the Mid Rim.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 28">[[Star Wars (2020) 28|''Star Wars'' (2020) 28]]</ref> Sometime after, Lady Qi'ra launched a campaign aimed at destroying the Sith: while "[[the Archivist]]" led a group tasked with unlocking the recently recovered<ref name="Crimson Reign 5" /> Fermata Cage, secret Crimson Dawn agents across the galaxy were activated and utilized to spread chaos throughout the Empire by such means as espionage, sabotage and assassination.<ref name="Hidden Empire 1">[[Hidden Empire 1|''Hidden Empire'' 1]]</ref>

Around this time, with the aid of the [[Eye of Webbish Bog]] on Mustafar, Vader experienced Force visions the dark side, several of the potential future involving Sidious. In one, Sabé was outfitted in armor similar to Vader's in front of him and the Emperor. In another, Sidious contacted him on Mustafar to inform him that Lady Qi'ra claimed to have the [[Fermata Cage]] and sent him to recover it. In a third, Sidious contacted him aboard the ''Executor'', revealing that the Fermata Cage was designed by Darth Momin and explaining that it was capable of holding a being in stasis outside of time. In yet another, Sidious was killed by Qi'ra.<ref name="Revelations (2022) 1">[[Revelations (2022) 1|''Revelations'' (2022) 1]]</ref>

The Emperor soon struck back against Qi'ra, meeting by holocomm with leaders of the major crime syndicates, ordering them to end their war with each other and focus their efforts on Crimson Dawn. Meanwhile, Imperial forces, including [[Inferno Squad]] and Lord Vader worked to root out the Crimson Dawn agents while the fleet soon discovered where Qi'ra and her flagship, the ''[[Vermillion (Crimson Dawn)|Vermillion]]'', were hiding. The Emperor then spoke with a hologram of Lady Qi'ra, informing her that Vader had described her as formidable. Sidious expressed his regret that she seemed foolish enough to desire the enmity of the Sith. He attempted to chide her, stating that Maul had undoubtedly taught her a healthy fear of the Sith, but Qi'ra retorted that Maul had taught her ''many'' things.<ref name="Hidden Empire 1" />

Sidious dismissed Maul as an idiot and asked what Qi'ra planned to do now that she had his attention. She replied that she would do whatever she had to and when Sidious learned that Qi'ra was at that moment preparing to attack his ships, he told her not to throw away her life, insisting that her capabilities made her of possible use to him. Qi'ra told the Sith that he didn't understand: she didn't recognize his authority. Sidious rejoined that he was disappointed in her inability to distinguish between authority and power, power that he truly held over her whether she accepted it or not. The Sith proceeded to claim that Qi'ra's history was tainted by that of her teacher, Maul, who had never been quite good enough. Sidious declared that just like he had turned away from Maul after finding him lacking, so he was also losing interest in her. Qi'ra remarked that he would see.<ref name="Hidden Empire 1" />

At that moment, Sidious felt a disturbance in the Force, one that he knew Qi'ra was in some way responsible for. Unsettled by this, he demanded to know what Qi'ra had done. She repeated that she was doing whatever she had to and mocked his ignorance of the Screaming Key's purpose, revealing that it had unlocked the Fermata Cage. A disbelieving Sidious proceeded to Force choke Qi'ra, claiming that she was lying, but soon released her when she said she was the only way for him to discover the truth. Qi'ra told Sidious that a Sith Lord was suspended inside the Fermata Cage and that Maul had found them, hoping to release the Sith Lord upon Sidious. Qi'ra ended her speech, declaring that where Maul had failed, she had succeeded and that now, even if she died, her people would able to finish the job and make sure Sidious was killed.<ref name="Hidden Empire 1" />

Meanwhile, battle had been joined between the ''Vermillion'' and the Imperial fleet. The Crimson Dawn flagship rammed an [[Interdictor-class Star Destroyer|''Interdictor''-class Star Destroyer]], destroying both as Qi'ra's hologram terminated. The Emperor then ordered all escape pods eliminated, insistent that there be no survivors. Sidious then contacted Vader on Mustafar, and after a brief aside about some minor damage to his helmet, asked him if he had felt the disturbance. Vader stated that he had, describing it as a storm in the dark side. Sidious told him that Qi'ra claimed to have the Fermata Cage and ordered him to retrieve it and kill anyone with knowledge of its existence.<ref name="Revelations (2022) 1" /><ref name="Hidden Empire 1" /> Elsewhere, the bounty hunter Chanath Cha asked Qi'ra if she thought Palpatine realized she was never aboard the ''Vermillion''; Qi'ra replied that if he hadn't, he eventually would.<ref name="Hidden Empire 1" />

Later, during a mission in [[No-Space]], Leia Organa referred to the Emperor as a tyrant and Lando Calrissian stated the strong likelihood that the Rebel Alliance would lose the war with the Emperor having them executed. After they left No-Space, Leia speculated to Luke Skywalker that the [[Force Wave]] that they had been feeling could prove distracting for the Emperor and Darth Vader.<ref name="Star Wars (2020) 33">[[Star Wars (2020) 33|''Star Wars'' (2020) 33]]</ref>

====Downfall of the Sith====
=====Schemes against the Rebellion=====
{{Quote|I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.''"<br />"''They are clear, my master.''"<br />"''Then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for him.''"<br />"''He will come to me?''"<br />"''I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you... and then you will bring him before me.''"<br />"''As you wish.|Darth Sidious and Darth Vader|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:SidEmp.png|thumb|250px|The Emperor tricked the Alliance into attacking the second Death Star, using himself as bait.]]
In the months after the events on Bespin, Luke Skywalker would continue to hone his skills in the [[light side of the Force]]; nonetheless, Sidious still believed Skywalker liable to turn to the dark side.<ref name="Episode VI" />

In an attempt to gain a new Sith apprentice as well as end the Galactic Civil War, Sidious purposely allowed the Rebels to obtain the plans of the new Death Star under construction over the forest moon of [[Endor]].<ref name="Episode VI" /> Following the presumed destruction of a vast majority of the Rebellion in a doomed confrontation against an unknowingly armed and operational Death Star, Sidious planned on commencing the deployment of some of the largest invasion fleets known in galactic history to blockade the known rebel strongholds of [[Mon Cala]] and [[Chandrila]] until the Death Star II could destroy them, permanently ending the Rebellion and all those that would oppose his rule through sheer terror.<ref name="Moving Target">''[[Moving Target: A Princess Leia Adventure]]''</ref>

The Emperor went to the second Death Star intending to oversee the ultimate defeat of the Rebellion and the Jedi, using himself as additional bait to draw the Alliance out. A massive amount of Imperial personnel,<ref name="Episode VI" /> including two [[astromech droid]]s, witnessed their Emperor's momentous arrival<ref name="CVD">''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition]]''</ref> in [[Hangar 272]].<ref name="Battle Stations">{{EncyclopediaCite|Battle Stations of the Empire and the First Order}}</ref> Shortly before his meeting with Luke Skywalker, the Emperor sensed the existence of a mysterious, malevolent force in the farthest reaches of the unexplored regions; he suspected it to be the possible source of the dark side of the Force, but even the Emperor wasn't sure who or what he was sensing.<ref name="Empire's End" /> He also sensed the death of Yoda, who appeared to him as a Force spirit, much to Sidious' surprise. All the same, he began to gloat about his coming victory until Yoda suddenly vanished.<ref name="Masters">{{StoryCite|story=Masters|book=Stories of Jedi and Sith}}</ref>

=====Meeting Luke Skywalker=====
{{Quote|I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time, you will call me master.|Darth Sidious, to Luke Skywalker|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:GreejatusAndFriends-ROTJ.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sidious and Vader made plans to crush the Rebellion at Endor, and to ensure that Skywalker turned to the dark side.]]
Whilst on the Death Star, Luke Skywalker, [[Han Solo]], Princess Leia, and [[Chewbacca]] managed to sneak past the shield and land on the Sanctuary Moon. Vader, who had been told to dispatch the fleet to the moon and to remain on a command ship, sensed his son's arrival. Because of this, he journeyed to the Death Star, where he told the Emperor that he sensed Luke's arrival. Surprised that he himself was unable to sense it, the Emperor commanded Vader to go and wait for him, saying that he had foreseen Luke seeking Vader out and surrendering to him personally out of compassion for his father.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Shortly after Skywalker and the rebel strike team landed on Endor, the Emperor summoned his secret protégé, Admiral Gallius Rax, for a secret meeting aboard his [[Emperor's Throne Room|throne room]] on the second Death Star. Sensing a [[shatterpoint]] approaching, Darth Sidious warned Rax that it may soon be time to implement the Contingency. He then ordered Rax to take<ref name="Empire's End" /> the ''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought<ref name="The Rebel Files" /> ''[[Ravager]]'' into the [[Vulpinus Nebula]] and hide until the events of this shatter point had resolved. He also told Rax that there would be others he had to call to his side.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Once Luke surrendered, Darth Vader brought his son to the space station and his master's throne room. The Emperor greeted Luke, dismissed the guardsmen and removed his chains. Luke was told that the Emperor planned to turn Luke to the dark side and that all that has happened on the Moon was all his plan. The Emperor also managed to explain that his father was irredeemable and could never be turned from the dark side. Sidious also had a surprise in store for the Rebels. When the Alliance Fleet arrived, the Death Star's superlaser was operational, contrary to what the Rebels had been led to believe. The Death Star was able to destroy several of the command ships, but the Rebels both on the surface and in space managed to press forward with their attack, as Lando was counting on Han to destroy the Shield Generator.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Palpatine_saber_clash.png|thumb|250px|Sidious manipulated Skywalker into a battle with his father, seeking to replace Vader with a younger apprentice.]]
Luke was then manipulated by the Emperor, who told him of his friends' impending doom and Luke was told that he would soon become his apprentice. Luke at first resisted, but as the Emperor continued to taunt him, Luke grew angrier and then grabbed his [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|lightsaber]] to strike the old man down. Darth Vader intercepted Luke's strike and the two began to engage in a duel much to the Emperor's delight.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Luke was first able to calm himself, refusing several times to continue fighting his father. Luke attempted to hide from Vader as their fight became more intense but Vader was able to sense his son's thoughts and learned that Luke had a sister. With this knowledge, Vader told Luke that if he did not turn to the dark side, perhaps Leia would. The threat of losing his sister enraged Luke and drove him to angrily attack Vader.<ref name="Episode VI" />

After Luke cut off Vader's mechanical hand, Sidious betrayed Vader by instructing Luke to take Vader's place by his side, much like how he betrayed Dooku and had him replaced with Vader. However, Luke began to see what had happened and that he was dangerously close to becoming like his father was now: a slave to the dark side of the Force. Luke threw away his lightsaber and turned to face the Emperor. He told the Emperor that he would never turn to the dark side and that he was a Jedi, like his father before him.<ref name="Episode VI" />

=====Demise=====
{{Quote|If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed!|Darth Sidious, to Luke Skywalker|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:TorturePalpatine2321.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious punished the defiant Jedi while Vader could only watch as his son was slowly tortured to death.]]
Angered by Skywalker's defiance, the Emperor unleashed a torrent of Force lightning upon him, forcing him onto the floor. The Emperor then proceeded to torment Luke, remarking that his rudimentary skills were no match for the power of the dark side. Meanwhile, Darth Vader watched his son struggle and plead for him to intervene, with Sidious threatening to kill the defenseless, young Skywalker; unbeknownst to Sidious, this was troubling Vader. Ultimately his concern and compassion for his son, caused the former Anakin Skywalker to wake up and save Luke. The redeemed Anakin grabbed the Emperor and threw him off a ledge down the Death Star's reactor shaft to his imminent death. Firing his lightning upward as he fell, the Emperor apparently could do nothing but scream as he went the long way down towards the second Death Star's reactor, causing a great explosion upon hitting it and releasing a light blue wind which encompassed the throne room before falling back down the shaft.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:BountyHunters38-VirginVariant-Sprouse.png|thumb|220px|Balance was restored to the Force through the deaths of Sidious and Vader, the last Sith Lords in the lineage of Darth Bane.]]
The Reborn Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker had killed Sidious and destroyed the Sith. With his armor badly damaged by the Emperor's lightning, Anakin's decision to save his son's life would cost him his own. Before passing away into the Force, a dying Anakin requested Luke to remove the helmet Sidious forced him to wear all those years so he could finally see his son's face with his own eyes. Luke tried to convince Anakin to let him be saved by him, but Anakin told Luke that he already did and that he was right about there still being good in him, despite all that he had done, before dying peacefully.<ref name="Episode VI" /> By destroying Sidious and the Sith, Anakin brought balance to the Force, ultimately fulfilling the ancient prophecy of the Chosen One as Qui-Gon Jinn had believed he would thirty-five years earlier.<ref name="Episode I" /> With this his nightmarish era of tyranny died with him. Or so the galaxy believed, as Sidious was not so easily destroyed.<ref name="Sidious BioGal 2, 3, and 4" />

While he died in every natural sense of the word,<ref name="A Family at War">''[[Skywalker: A Family at War]]''</ref> even death wasn't the end for Sidious.<ref name="Episode IX" /> When betrayed by Anakin Skywalker aboard the second Death Star, Sidious had little time to realize that his apprentice had turned on him much like he once did with Darth Plagueis, but unlike his former master, he had prepared himself for Skywalker's betrayal. Calling on all the power of the dark side of the Force, and utilizing the secret to immortality he pilfered from Plagueis, the Emperor [[Transference|transferred]] his consciousness<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> and spirit<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" /> far, far away as his empty body kept falling towards the battle station's reactor to his death.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" />

===Cheating death===

Sidious however did not return unscathed. Because of his timely intervention, Sidious was able to prevent his demise unlike his own master Plagueis,<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> but while he was able to stave off death with the cloning technology and concentration of dark side energy on the planet, true immortality still eluded the Dark Lord.<ref name="TSWB" /> Additionally, his new body was insufficient for containing his spirit, due to his power in the dark side of the Force being so immense, and consequently began to decay.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" />

[[File:Endor_is_A_Lie.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Imperial propaganda initially denied reports of the Emperor's death in the Battle of Endor.]]
Following the Emperor's demise, the Empire attempted to suppress the true outcome of the Battle of Endor. In the [[Anoat sector]], which was cut off from the rest of the galaxy by an Imperial [[Iron Blockade|blockade]] in the days following the attack, Imperial [[propaganda]] claimed that the attack on the second Death Star had failed and the rebellion was no longer a threat. Rumors of the Emperor's death were dismissed as treasonous fabrications by Governor [[Ubrik Adelhard]].<ref name="Uprising">''[[Star Wars: Uprising]]''</ref> Although several holovids were circulated to show that the second Death Star had been destroyed, both rebels and Imperials around the galaxy discussed whether the Emperor or Darth Vader had really died or not, as no one was sure what exactly happened.<ref name="Aftermath" /> Many Imperial messages surrounding the Emperor's death contradicted each other; some Imperials like Grand Moff [[Lozen Tolruck]] suggested that the Emperor had escaped the second Death Star through miraculous means, others wildly claimed that the Emperor was still leading the Empire from beyond the grave and some simply refused to acknowledge for months the Emperor's demise.<ref name="Aftermath: Life Debt" />

[[File:OperationCinder.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Operation: Cinder went into effect when Sidious died, initiating a covert plan to destroy the Empire.]]
Intending for only the most ruthless of the Empire to survive and to punish the galaxy for his death, further believing that the Empire as it existed did not deserve to survive if he could not rule it,<ref name="Battles that Changed">''[[Star Wars: Battles that Changed the Galaxy]]''</ref> the Emperor also posthumously issued [[Operation: Cinder]] to a select group of Imperial officers, including Admiral [[Garrick Versio]] and Captain [[Lerr Duvat]], which called for the scouring of multiple worlds, including his own homeworld of Naboo.<ref name="Shattered Empire 2">[[Shattered Empire 2|''Shattered Empire'' 2]]</ref> The days following the Emperor's death were chaotic, as massive uprisings, which the Empire tried to cease, took place on thousands of planets to prove that the rebels had been right all along about public sentiment toward the Empire.<ref name="Alphabet Squadron">[[Alphabet Squadron (novel)|''Alphabet Squadron'']]</ref> Months after Endor, dark side adherents such as the [[Acolytes of the Beyond]] came to worship Vader and the dark side of the Force on planets across the galaxy such as the planet [[Taris]].<ref name="Aftermath" />

As several [[New Republic soldier]]s were discussing what they would do if Sidious' body had been recovered, a [[Unidentified Mon Calamari soldier|Mon Calamari soldier]] of the [[61st Mobile Infantry]] expressed his wish that the Emperor had survived Endor, as that would have allowed him to face trial for every crime.<ref name="Shadow Fall">''[[Shadow Fall: An Alphabet Squadron Novel]]''</ref> While searching the [[Hall of Imperial Register]] on Coruscant<ref name="Aftermath: Life Debt" /> in [[5 ABY]],<ref name="Life Debt">''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]'' dates the events of ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' to [[5 ABY]].</ref> Grand Admiral Rae Sloane discovered that the Emperor's personal Super Star Destroyer [[Eclipse (Executor-class)|''Eclipse'']] had mysteriously disappeared instead of being destroyed by the [[New Republic]] as reported in the Imperial charts. She also found an [[image crystal]] showing a still image of Sidious and several Imperial Guards, stormtroopers, and officials including [[Wullf Yularen]], Dodd Rancit, [[Terrinald Screed]], Grand Vizier Mas Amedda, and Gallius Rax. Rax had since risen to the rank of [[Fleet Admiral]] and was Sloane's secret puppet-master. Following the [[Attack on Chandrila]], Rax brought the Empire to Jakku.<ref name="Aftermath: Life Debt" />

Though Rax claimed that he was testing the resolve of the Empire before a [[Battle of Jakku|showdown]] with the New Republic, Rax secretly intended to carry out the Contingency. The Contingency involved orchestrating a battle between the Imperial and the New Republic fleets and destroying the two belligerents by detonating Jakku's core, leaving only the "worthy,"<ref name="Empire's End" /> ruthless Imperials alive<ref name="Battles that Changed" /> to reform the Empire. The Jakku [[Observatory]] contained a deep borehole which led to the planet's core. Rax planned to pour various Sith artifacts into the borehole in order to activate the planet's self-destruction. In secret, Rax had arranged for himself and several "worthy" Imperials including [[Brendol Hux]], his son [[Armitage Hux]], and a contingent of child soldiers to flee into the Unknown Regions. Sloane managed to stop Rax's plan to destroy Jakku with the help of the rebels [[Norra Wexley]] and [[Brentin Lore Wexley]]. Despite perishing on Jakku, Rax succeeded in fulfilling his master's orders to bring about the collapse of the "Old Empire."<ref name="Empire's End" />

[[File:HuxAndStormtroopersAtCommandCenter-TFAOfficialTeaser.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Through the Contingency, Sidious destroyed his Empire and ensured its rebirth as the First Order.]]
Palpatine's great power as Chancellor and then Emperor left an impact on the [[New Republic Senate]], which feared ever giving an executive similiar authority. As such, the [[Chancellor (New Republic)|Chancellor]] of the New Republic was given greatly reduced power compared to the office under the Galactic Republic,<ref name="Bloodline">[[Bloodline (novel)|''Bloodline'']]</ref> with the word "Supreme" even being dropped from the title.<ref name="TFA VD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> However, the Chancellor's reduced influence complicated politics in the opposite way as Palpatine's authority; instead of having a head of state with too much power, the Chancellor had too little influence to make change.<ref name="Bloodline" /> Eventually, the Contingency<ref name="TLJ Expanded Edition" /> and overall legacy Darth Sidious left behind ended up becoming the basis of the regime that developed into the [[First Order]], the Empire's successor, led by the mysterious [[Snoke]], who took over the position of [[Supreme Leader]] of the Order.<ref name="Episode VII">{{Film|VII}}</ref> After wiping out most of what remained of the Imperial leadership, with several exceptions such as Armitage Hux, Snoke went to discover several truths about Sidious, such as the fact that Sidious' Contingency had always been a two-fold plan, one that involved ensuring the Empire's rebirth among the survivors of the Old Empire.<ref name="TLJ Expanded Edition" />

===From the shadows===
====The foundations of a new empire====
{{Quote|With the Empire erased from existence, something new could rise in its place. And from beyond the grave, I would control its every move&hellip;|Darth Sidious|<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" />}}
[[File:Unidentified_Star_Destroyer_fleet.png|thumb|250px|Sidious envisioned the Final Order as the largest fleet in galactic history: an armada capable of imposing eternal domination upon the entire galaxy.]]
On Exegol, other Sith cultists had gathered to venerate the ancient Sith Order and swear fealty to the last Sith Lord, Sidious.<ref name="Sith Eternal DB" /> These followers<ref name="Episode IX" /> venerated his efforts to bring about a new Sith Empire<ref name="TROS VD" /> and labored to rebuild the Empire from Exegol as a true Sith Empire. To this end, Sidious' underlings crafted a vast armada of [[Xyston-class Star Destroyer|planet-killing warships]],<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> the [[Final Order]]. From the shadows,<ref name="Episode IX" /> Sidious plotted his return to power, and forged the remnants of the Empire into the First Order while he manipulated the New Republic.<ref name="Sidious BioGal 25" /> Once deployed from Exegol, the Final Order would bolster the forces of the [[First Order military]], allowing the regime to finalize its subjugation of the galaxy. The Sith Eternal labored for a generation,<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> raising children in secret military camps, while building war machines in secret factories and shipyards.<ref name="Sith Eternal DB" />

Sith loyalists served on the executive boards of corporations such as [[Kuat-Entralla Engineering]] and [[Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems]], which allowed them to funnel assets critical to their domineering machinations through subsidiaries to Exegol. Under Sidious, the children of the Sith Eternal were raised to covet the religion of the Sith, while being ingrained with the utmost loyalty to their Emperor. Their efforts yielded legions of [[Sith trooper]]s, soldiers trained to be fanatically loyal to the Sith via flash imprinting technologies built upon the [[Kaminoan]] techniques in the training of clone troopers. The efforts of the Sith Eternal led to the creation of a fleet and [[Sith Eternal army|army]] which would spell the end of freedom in the galaxy were they to escape into hyperspace.<ref name="TROS VD" />

====Building the First Order====
{{Quote|Through my manipulation of Snoke, I began gathering forces, building an army capable of opposing the New Republic that had risen in my absence. Through Snoke, I would make certain that the First Order would be mine to control.|Darth Sidious|<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" />}}
[[File:SnokeThrone-TLJ.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious ruled the First Order by proxy through his genetic creation, Snoke, who rose to become Supreme Leader with his powerful connection to the dark side.]]
Sidious utilized one of the Sith Eternal's and his genetic experiments to spread his influence across the galaxy through indirect means while he was forced to remain on Exegol due to his condition.<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" /> This being was Snoke,<ref name="Snoke DB" /> a humanoid genetic strandcast that,<ref name="TSWB" /> like the Emperor's cloned body,<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" /> originated from the Sith Eternal's [[Imperial cloning program|experimentation]] in attempts of extending Sidious' lifespan and produce him a vessel worthy of housing the dark essence that was his spirit, during the reign of the Galactic Empire.<ref name="TSWB" /> Though Snoke was naturally force-sensitive, Sidious deemed his body an unworthy vessel for housing his dark essence, but still found use for him as puppet for his plans of restoring himself to power.<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" />

Snoke became Sidious' proxy in power over the First Order,<ref name="TSWB" /> a hermit state that began as the [[Imperial Remnants|remnants]] of the Galactic Empire that escaped under the Contingency,<ref name="TROS VD" /> and by extension, helped ensure the faction would be his to control.<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" /> Snoke rose to become Supreme Leader over the faction,<ref name="TLJ Expanded Edition" /> and through manipulating his puppet, Sidious gathered the forces that would go on to form the First Order's military,<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" /> while under Snoke's guidance, the militia developed into a technologically superior war machine over the one under the Galactic Empire.<ref name="TLJ Expanded Edition" /> In addition, while the First Order served as the military arm of the Contingency, the Sith Eternal secretly served as its hidden spiritual heart,<ref name="TROS VD" /> while none were aware they were secretly controlled by the Sith.<ref name="TSWB" />

Many were confused to some of Snoke's motives upon his rise to power, such as making no effort to claim the old title of Emperor held by Palpatine during the reign of the Empire, while he also delegated main control and building of the First Order to his subordinates and focused on spiritual matter instead. Nevertheless he possessed the knowledge and power to rule them, which made him the undisputed heir to the Contingency.<ref name="TROS VD" /> However, even though the highest echelons of the First Order, remained unaware of Snoke's true origins<ref name="TSWB" /> and their ultimate purpose in the form of the Contingency, some in the Order, such as [[Enric Pryde]], came to suspect that Snoke was subservient to some greater power.<ref name="TROS VD" />

====The Skywalker heir====
{{Quote|Young Ben Solo possessed what all masters live to see: raw, untamed power. But a great conflict raged within the boy as well. Not only did his inner turmoil make him heir apparent to his grandfather, Lord Vader, it also made him the perfect pawn.|Darth Sidious|<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" />}}
[[File:TalkingBehindLukesBack-TheRiseOfKyloRen2.jpg|thumb|250px|Sidious conspired to turn Ben Solo, the heir to the Skywalker bloodline, to the dark side as he did with Anakin Skywalker.]]
In addition to restoring himself to power as Galactic Emperor, Sidious endeavored to convert the next generation of the Skywalker bloodline to the dark side of the Force.<ref name="A Family at War" /> The Sith Lord targeted Ben Solo,<ref name="TSWB" /> the son of Han Solo and grandson of Anakin Skywalker through his mother, princess Leia Organa, and nephew of the last Jedi Luke Skywalker,<ref name="TROS VD" /> for his prodigious strength in the Force inherited from his family's bloodline.<ref name="TSWB" /> Through the Force, Sidious watched over Solo throughout his life,<ref name="TROS Junior Novel" /> using telepathy to communicate with him as a variety of dark voices.<ref name="Episode IX" /> The voice Solo would hear in his mind told him secrets and provided warnings of danger, comforting and guiding him, but also deceiving him with false promise that he could not survive on his own without its help,<ref name="TROS Junior Novel" /> effectively play on his insecurities and using his fears against him.<ref name="TROS VD" />

Furthermore, Sidious, in addition to using him as a placeholder for the First Order, utilized Snoke as his proxy for luring Solo to the dark side.<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" /> In addition to Sidious,<ref name="TROS VD" /> Snoke whispered to the young Jedi telepathically, cultivating a friendship with the boy as he manipulated him with deceit, encouraging his negative thoughts about his family and his impulsive tendencies,<ref name="A Family at War" /> while utilizing his desperate need for a teacher and fascination with his family's legacy to influence him.<ref name="Snoke DB" /> When Palpatine and Snoke constantly whispered to Solo,<ref name="A Family at War" /> the Phantom Emperor also utilized this when Solo joined the new Jedi Order as a Padawan under his maternal uncle, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, during his attempt to restore the religious faction of peacekeepers, and partially engineer the failures that would lead to its eventual destruction.<ref name="BioGal2" />

====A perfect vessel====
{{Quote|There is no vessel in the galaxy more worthy of my infinite might than a child of my own flesh. With a slash of her lightsaber, my spirit will pass into her. We two will be reborn as one&hellip; and once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy. Eternally.|Darth Sidious, referring to his granddaughter Rey|<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" />}}
[[File:Rey_mum_and_dad-TROS.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The strandcast sired a daughter, Rey, who inherited her grandfather's power in the Force.]]
Sidious never anticipated his son's union,<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> now going by the name Dathan, but the clone met a woman named [[Miramir]]<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> and became intimately involved, and eventually with whom he sired a Force-sensitive daughter, Rey,<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> in [[15 ABY]].<ref name="Rey date2">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]'' states that Rey is nineteen [[Standard year|years]] old during the events of [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']], which is dated to [[34 ABY]] by ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''. Therefore it can be deduced that Rey was [[Reproduction|born]] in [[15 ABY]].</ref> To the Emperor, Rey was regarded as an ideal vessel to contain his spirit and all the power of the Sith,<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> and he was determined to capture his granddaughter at any cost.<ref name="TSWB" /> However, his son and his wife went into hiding to protect their daughter from the Sith Lord, living as junk traders on the desert planet of Jakku.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" />

Sidious dispatched Ochi,<ref name="Episode IX" /> now a cultist of the Sith Eternal,<ref name="TROS VD" /> to track down and retrieve Rey from her parents and bring her to Exegol<ref name="Episode IX" /> in [[21 ABY]].<ref>''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary]]'' establishes [[Rey Skywalker|Rey]] was abandoned on [[Jakku]] thirteen [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Hosnian Cataclysm]], which ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates to [[34 ABY]]. Therefore, it can be deduced [[Ochi]] discovered Rey's [[parent]]s' location in [[21 ABY]].</ref> Ochi was close to discovering the location of Rey and her parents<ref name="Episode IX" /> when, wanting to protect their daughter, Rey's parents gave her to Jakku junk boss [[Unkar Plutt]], who was paid with a [[songsteel]] [[Sith Eternal crest|hex charm]]<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> to keep her hidden.<ref name="Paid with Songsteel">{{Twitter|ghostfinder|status/1720061820998762702|[[Adam Christopher]]|quote=Rey wasn't sold to Unkar Plutt - Dathan and Miramir paid him with a songsteel medallion to hide her.|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/Dmreo}}</ref> As Rey watched on, her parents fled Jakku on the ''[[Bestoon Legacy]]'', Ochi's starship,<ref name="Episode VII" /> to lead the assassin away.<ref name="Shadow of the Sith" /> After refusing to reveal the location of their daughter, on the Emperor's order, Ochi stabbed Dathan and his wife to death<ref name="Episode IX" /> aboard his ship.<ref name="TROS Junior Novel" /> Despite their deaths, their sacrifice<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> allowed Rey to elude capture,<ref name="Sidious BioGal 2, 3, and 4" /> and she would remain hidden on Jakku for the next thirteen years, until 34 ABY.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====The Rise of Kylo Ren====
=====Whispering in Solo's ear=====
{{Quote|Now you will be who you are. Who you were always meant to be.|Darth Sidious, to Kylo Ren|<ref name="TRoKR 4">[[The Rise of Kylo Ren 4|''The Rise of Kylo Ren'' 4]]</ref>}}
[[File:DarthSidious-TheRiseOfKyloRen4.png|thumb|right|250px|Sidious whispered encouragement to Solo as he fell to the dark side of the Force and became Kylo Ren.]]
Sidious' followers had designed Snoke to groom Solo, serving as the one who molded him into a master of attack and cunning, while also testing his capacity to inherit not only the legacy of his grandfather, Darth Vader, but of the entire Sith Order.<ref name="TROS VD" /> Snoke came to believe that Ben Solo had the right balance of the light and dark sides of the Force in him due to his heritage as Anakin Skywalker's grandson.<ref name="TFA novel">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref> Snoke manipulated Solo for more than a decade, his influence proving crucial as the fledgling Jedi learned that Darth Vader was his grandfather, having been kept from such a truth by his family.<ref name="A Family at War" />

When Luke Skywalker sensed Solo's growing darkness, the Jedi Master approached his student as he slept and, in a brief moment of instinct, activated his lightsaber with the intention of killing his nephew. Skywalker immediately hesitated and regretted his actions, but it was too late. Solo awoke confused and scared, seeing no other recourse than to ignite his own saber and intercept Skywalker's. Though his master attempted to assuage the situation, Solo immediately used the Force to topple his room and trap his uncle beneath the rubble.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Shortly thereafter, a violent storm<ref name="TRoKR 1">[[The Rise of Kylo Ren 1|''The Rise of Kylo Ren'' 1]]</ref> caused by Solo<ref name="TROS VD" /> suddenly set Skywalker's [[Jedi Temple of Luke Skywalker|Jedi temple]] ablaze, [[Destruction of the Jedi Temple|destroying it]] and killing all the students inside.<ref name="TRoKR 1" />

[[File:StarWars2020-25-variant-Sliney-textless.jpg|thumb|left|250px|From the shadows, Sidious manipulated affairs, his foes, and his pawns to lure Ben Solo to the dark side, bringing about the rise of the dark warrior Kylo Ren.]]
Solo fled the temple after he burned and destroyed it.<ref name="TROS VD" /> At the insistence of Snoke, Solo sought to join the Knights of Ren. After being tested by the Knights, he was reluctantly accepted into the mysterious group. Although their leader [[Ren (human)|Ren]] saw potential in Solo's raw power, he doubted the boy's hatred and ability to kill. Ren's suspicions were confirmed on a mission to the [[Minemoon]] after Ben hesitated to kill his former friend and fellow student of Luke Skywalker, [[Tai]]. Enraged and disappointed in Solo, Ren engaged him in a duel. Across the galaxy, Sidious sensed Ben's every move and emotion. Prompting the fallen Jedi through the Force, the Dark Lord of the Sith called for Ben to claim his birthright and strike down the leader of the Knights of Ren. Giving in to Sidious' manipulation, in a fit of rage Ben overpowered and stabbed Ren. Taking up the mantle of [[Ren|master of the Knights of Ren]], Solo dubbed himself "Kylo Ren."<ref name="TRoKR 4" /> To ensure Kylo remained on the dark side, Sidious would communicate with Ren from afar, impersonating the spirit of his grandfather and idol, Darth Vader.<ref name="Episode IX" />

=====A cunning test=====
{{Quote|Snoke. He was nothing but your test. You did well to destroy him.|Darth Sidious, to Kylo Ren|<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" />}}
[[File:Death_of_the_Supreme_Leader.png|thumb|right|250px|Sidious regarded Snoke as nothing more than a test to determine Kylo Ren's worthiness of inheriting the Sith legacy.]]
Through Snoke, Sidious was able to indirectly oversee the young Ben Solo's training,<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> thinking the humanoid taught their mutual apprentice well.<ref name="Episode IX" /> Though he considered himself to be Ren's true master the whole time,<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> through the dark side adept, the Emperor also planned to sidestep the tradition of a dark apprentice slaying their dark master to ascend to ultimate power,<ref name="TSWB" /> which Snoke's entire existence was built for in the first place.<ref name="TROS VD" />

Snoke's training of Kylo Ren proved effective, warping his understanding of his grandfather' history,<ref name="TROS VD" /> conditioning him to believe the worst in people and that they would reject him and redemption would be impossible after his actions, while instructing him to pursue his impulses as a shortcut for power in the dark side when he chased his desires.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" />

[[File:Long_Live_The_Supreme_Leader.png|thumb|left|250px|With Snoke's death, Ren completed his final test set out by the Sith Eternal and became the new Supreme Leader of the First Order.]]
In 34 [['ABY-BBY' dating system|ABY]], Rey [[Battle of Oetchi|confronted]] the Supreme Leader and his dark apprentice aboard the ''[[Supremacy]]'', believing she could turn the former Ben Solo back to the light. Snoke overpowered Rey, and having gauged her resolve, he saw that she had the spirit of a true Jedi. Determined to see every trace of the Jedi Order eradicated, he ordered her death but left the deed to Kylo Ren. Sensing his apprentice's newfound resolve, Snoke urged Ren to complete his training and fulfill his destiny by executing Rey. Instead, Ren outmaneuvered his master by assassinating him with the [[Skywalker lightsaber]]. With Snoke dead, Ren asserted his claim to the title of Supreme Leader, seizing political and military control of the First Order.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> By murdering his master in the name of obtaining greater power, Ren had unknowingly completed the Sith Eternal's final test and proved himself as an individual worthy of inheriting the legacy of the Sith.<ref name="TROS VD" />

Despite Snoke's unexpected death, and failure to bring Rey to Palpatine, the zombified Sith Lord continued to pull the strings from afar, manipulating both Kylo Ren and Rey, in order to lure them toward him. His granddaughter coming to Exegol was a key and vital part of his plan.<ref name="Inside Intel">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-inside-intel-palpatines-contingency-plan|text=''Star Wars'' Inside Intel: Palpatine's Contingency Plan|int=Star Wars Inside Intel}}</ref>

{{Quote|At last the work of generations is complete. The great error is corrected. The day of victory is at hand. The day of revenge. The day of the Sith.|Darth Sidious' message|audio=PalpatinesBroadcast.flac|<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" />}}
[[File:SidiousandKyloRen-TROS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sidious entreated Ren to succeed where Vader failed, destroying the last Jedi and becoming the new Emperor.]]
In [[35 ABY]],<ref name="TROS Date" /> a [[Palpatine's broadcast|mysterious audio broadcast]] using the voice of Emperor Palpatine, the public identity of Darth Sidious, who was still thought to be dead by the galaxy at large, was released to the galaxy, threatening revenge. Upon this, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren began a search for the broadcast's source, deeming it a challenge to his rule. After [[Mission to Mustafar (First Order)|acquiring]] a Sith wayfinder on Mustafar that led him to Exegol, Ren entered the Sith Citadel on the planet's surface and confronted the decrepit Emperor, who admitted that he had created Snoke and impersonated Vader.<ref name="TROS VD" />

When the Supreme Leader threatened the decaying Emperor with death, the Dark Lord merely stated that he had already died before, and that the dark side of the Force was pathway to many abilities some considered to be unnatural, mirroring his conversation with Anakin at the opera ages ago. Sidious then revealed his creation of the Final Order, a Sith armada comprised of numerous ''Xyston''-class Star Destroyers, [[TIE/dg starfighter]]s, and an army of loyal Sith troopers. The purpose of this [[Sith Eternal military|new military]] was to restore Sith rule across the galaxy in the form of a new Sith Empire, which Sidious offered to Ren along with the title of Emperor,<ref name="TROS VD" /> but only if he killed the Jedi apprentice Rey. To Ren's surprise, Sidious revealed that he was Rey's "grandfather."<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" />

[[File:SidiousOrdersPryde-TROS.jpg|thumb|left|250px|After Ren renounced the dark side, Sidious gave command of the Final Order to Allegiant General Enric Pryde.]]
Ren shared this revelation with Rey, believing the truth of her heritage would turn her to the dark side. Rather than killing her, Ren hoped that Rey would aid him in the usurpation of her grandfather, allowing the pair to rule the galaxy as Emperor and Empress. Rey's continued survival caused Sidious to suspect treachery from Ren and as such he threatened to turn the Sith fleet against the Supreme Leader unless he killed her. Having been warned, Kylo went to the Endor system where he [[Mission to Kef Bir|dueled]] Rey on the [[Death Star ruins|remains]] of the second Death Star in the sea of the moon of [[Kef Bir]] until Rey fatally wounded him. However, upon sensing the death of Leia Organa at [[Ajan Kloss]], Rey [[Force healing|saved]] Kylo's life using Force healing and left him behind to mourn his mother. Ben would finally turn back to the light side after reflecting on Rey's act of compassion and his parents' sacrifice.<ref name="Episode IX" /> Having felt Organa's passing, Sidious cursed the former Princess of Alderaan for disrupting his plans one last time by costing him Kylo Ren's loyalty.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" />

Still, the Emperor remained confident that victory was at hand and asserted that Anakin Skywalker's daughter had died in vain.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> Sidious then communicated via hologram with [[Allegiant General]] Enric Pryde, who had previously served him during the Galactic Civil War.<ref name="Episode IX" /> With the Supreme Leader gone, the First Order's command defaulted on Pryde, whose allegiance to Sidious was secured, officially combining the First Order's forces with those of the Sith Eternal's Final Order.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> Realizing that the time had come to make his return, Sidious ordered Pryde to send one of his Star Destroyers, named the ''[[Derriphan]]'', to [[Kijimi]] and [[Destruction of Kijimi|destroy it]] in order to send a clear message to the Resistance.<ref name="Episode IX" />

[[File:ReyMeetsPalpatine-TROS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The clone suffered from rapid deterioration, forcing Sidious to seek out Rey as a new host for his spirit.]]
While initially intending to live out the rest of her days in exile like Luke Skywalker due to the fear of becoming a Sith herself, Rey was convinced to desist doing so by the Force spirit of Luke Skywalker himself, who encouraged her to not let her bloodline define her legacy and actions by gifting her a [[Leia's lightsaber|lightsaber]] which once belonged to Leia. After coming to terms with her past, Rey traveled to Exegol alone to face Sidious and transmitted the route to the Resistance. Upon finding her grandfather surrounded by the Sith Eternal in his [[Amphitheater of the Sith Eternal|throne room]], Rey was welcomed by Sidious, who rejected the notion that he wanted her dead, rather brought to him to succeed him as "Empress Palpatine."<ref name="Episode IX" />

[[File:Sidious_triumphant.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sidious rejuvenated his body by drawing power from the dyad of Ben Solo and Rey.]]
Sidious attempted to goad his granddaughter into striking him down, much like he had done to Luke Skywalker thirty-one years before, remarking that while Skywalker had his father to save him that day, he was the only family she had.<ref name="Episode IX" /> In actuality, Sidious wished for Rey to strike him down in order to initiate a Sith ritual that would transfer his spirit from the decaying clone body into the youthful Rey's, where he hoped to possess her body.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> In an attempt to increase her anger and hatred of him, Sidious told Rey that by transmitting the route to Exegol to her friends, she had led the Resistance into a [[Battle of Exegol|trap]] that would see all of them wiped out by the Sith Eternal forces.<ref name="Episode IX" />

====End of the Sith Eternal====

[[File:DarthPalpatine-TROS.png|thumb|right|250px|No longer needing his granddaughter, Sidious declared himself Emperor once more.]]
However, a glimpse of hope for Rey came when a redeemed Ben Solo, no longer Kylo Ren, arrived on Exegol to help her in her fight against Sidious.<ref name="Episode IX" /> Unknown to Sidious, his granddaughter had been stalling for time upon feeling that Solo had arrived on Exegol, precluding her from succumbing to the temptations of absolute power and the dark side of the Force.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> Feigning that she was going to strike him down with the Skywalker lightsaber, Rey transferred the lightsaber to Solo through their Force-bond, allowing Solo to promptly destroy the Knights of Ren while Rey used the lightsaber of her master, Leia Organa, to defend herself against the Emperor's [[Sovereign Protector]]s.<ref name="Episode IX" />

Astonished that his granddaughter didn't kill him like he had gleefully anticipated, Sidious realized with horror the mistake in allowing Rey and Solo to come together: their Force-bond had been forged in the fire of mutual searching, shared grief, rage, and hate, but what Sidious hadn't anticipated was that it also encompassed compassion and empathy.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" />

[[File:PalpatineIsDefeated-TROS.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sidious unleashed all the power of the Sith against Rey, and declared that her death would mark the end of rebellion.]]
With all the Knights and Sovereign Protectors dead, Solo joined Rey and dropped into a fighting stance against Sidious, who decreed that they would perish together for their insolence, before raising his rotting hand<ref name="Episode IX" /> and impaling them with the Force, pulling the two helpless warriors towards him. However, as an unforeseen consequence, their combined life force began to heal the clone vessel that was serving Sidious as his new body. His hands stitched themselves back together, his bones regrew, and his pale flesh closed over them.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> Sidious realized at once what was before him: a dyad in the Force, a [[Doctrine of the Dyad|prophesied]] phenomenon stronger than life itself, one which had not been seen for generations.<ref name="Episode IX" />

Realizing that their power would allow him to fully return to life, Sidious used the Force to [[Force drain|drain the life energy]] of both Force-users in order to restore himself to full strength.<ref name="Episode IX" /> As triumphant thoughts invaded his mind, Sidious harnessed the power of both the dark side and all the Sith who preceded him, continuing to pull more life energy from the dyad as if he was drawing on a flowing river of light so only he, the one true Emperor, would be restored.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" /> With his body and mobility fully restored and his powers amplified beyond measure, the Dark Lord released himself from the Ommin harness and declared himself the immortal Emperor of the Sith before his Sith loyalists, who praised their master's return. Having no further use of Solo and exclaiming revenge for his first death, the Emperor flung him into a pit as reinforcements brought by Lando Calrissian arrived to aid the Resistance.<ref name="Episode IX" />

[[File:The_death_of_Sidious.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rey destroyed Darth Sidious with the aid of the Jedi who came before, preventing the return of the Sith.]]
Intending to dispose of the Resistance as well and with his powers now stronger than ever before, the Emperor claimed that nothing would stop the resurgence of the Sith before he shot an immense amount of Force lightning into the [[atmosphere]] of Exegol, thereby disabling every Resistance ship for the time being. His attention soon returned to Rey, who was now empowered by the ghosts of the past Jedi. The Emperor, unfazed by Rey's defiance, declared her death to be the ultimate end of rebellion throughout the galaxy, during which he then unleashed a barrage of Force lightning on his granddaughter, which she blocked with the lightsaber of Leia Organa. Approaching his granddaughter, Sidious redoubled the intensity of his Force lightning to kill Rey, insisting her that she was no match to his power while declaring himself as all of the Sith. However, Rey called on the power of the Jedi of the past, ignited the Skywalker lightsaber as well as Organa's and deflected the Force lightning back onto the surprised Emperor, while declaring herself as all of the Jedi embodied. Horrified, Sidious kept unleashing his Force lightning, but Rey kept deflecting the energy and returned it to her grandfather, severely damaging him. As a result, Darth Sidious&mdash;the former Senator of Naboo, the last Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, Emperor of the galaxy, the Phantom Menace, and final Dark Lord of the Sith&ndash;was destroyed after well over a century by his very own power<ref name="Episode IX" /> once and for all<ref name="TROS Little Golden Book">[[The Rise of Skywalker (Little Golden Book)|''The Rise of Skywalker'' Little Golden Book]]</ref> both in body and soul,<ref name="TSWB" /> vaporizing his entire body and releasing a great Force wave that decimated the entire arena, along with killing all of the Sith Eternal loyalists. With the demise of Darth Sidious and the destruction of his cult, the rebirth of the Sith and establishment of the new Sith Empire was prevented.<ref name="Episode IX" />

[[File:The_Uprising_on_Jakku.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The destruction of Darth Sidious and the Sith Eternal galvanized galactic opposition against the First Order.]]
Given the amount of power required to forever destroy Sidious, Rey died after vanquishing the Emperor. However, Solo emerged from the pit where the Emperor had previously flung him and gave his remaining life energy to revive Rey, whom he shared a kiss with before he vanished into the Force as the last of the Skywalker bloodline. Despite her Sith lineage as Sidious' descendant,<ref name="Episode IX" /> Rey renamed herself "Rey Skywalker" to honor the family of her masters.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

Following the Battle of Exegol, the galaxy celebrated Sidious' death and the destruction of the Sith Eternal, with [[Uprising against the First Order|uprisings]] against the weakened First Order taking place on several planets.<ref name="Episode IX" /> Bespin, Jakku, [[Corellia]], Lothal, [[Thyferra]], [[Endor]], Coruscant and even Sidious' native Naboo were amongst the systems reported to be openly rebelling against his forces.<ref name="TROS Junior Novel">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: A Junior Novel]]''</ref>

During the victory celebration at the Ajan Kloss [[Resistance base (Ajan Kloss)|Resistance base]], [[Finn]] and [[Poe Dameron]] discussed the possibility of Sidious coming back once more, given that he came back more powerful than ever following his defeat at Endor. They concluded that while Sidious could perhaps return yet again, some other evil would arise as evil always rises, though not for a long time.<ref name="TROS Expanded Edition" />

Resistance historian [[Beaumont Kin]] would extensively document Palpatine's actions and motivations in his novel, ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Galactic Empire]]'', in an effort to separate the late Sith Lord from the Empire he created.<ref>[[Star Wars: The Rise and Fall of the Galactic Empire]]</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|If the vast and powerful forces I had gathered could not perform their sworn duty and protect their own Emperor, they did not deserve to lay claim to this galaxy in my absence.

[[File:Palpatine-TCWJH.png|thumb|right|200px|Darth Sidious cultivated the image of Sheev Palpatine, an honest and trustworthy politician prior to his ascension as Emperor.]]
Prior to the Galactic Empire, Darth Sidious was careful to put on a charade, presenting himself as a grandfatherly gentleman and a servant of the public good. When in character, he often spoke of himself with great modesty and maintained only as much luxury as was expected of someone of his stature.<ref name="explEPII Palpatine">{{SW|url=films/star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones|text=''Star Wars: Attack of the Clones''}} {{C|Relationships: Palpatine}}</ref> However, Sidious was, in fact, a skilled manipulator and strategist, having orchestrated countless events in the galaxy, from the Invasion of Naboo to the Clone Wars, while deceiving the Jedi, Senate, Republic, and even the Separatists, with the sole aim of increasing his own power.<ref name="SWEPalpatine" /> Even when something occurred that he did not initially plan for, the Sith Lord demonstrated that he was as adept at improvisation as he was at plotting,<ref name="Episode I" /> continuing to play his long game&mdash;a smart game&mdash;for power.<ref name="Queen's Peril" /> Sometimes he indulged in a simple fantasy by imagining lighting the Senate Building aflame, which he enjoyed thinking about because it would force everyone inside to run in panic while he watched. Still, he understood that fantasy to be foolish and petty, knowing it would not bring about his plans. Almost as satisfying to the Sith Lord was watching the Senate grapple with the Clone Wars and his new political powers.<ref name="Queen's Hope" />

Palpatine was someone who enjoyed the finer things of life.<ref name="FF 117 Palpatine" /> During the Republic Era, Sidious did not feel the need to hide in the lower levels of Coruscant, which he developed a personal dislike of. Instead, he preferred to remain amongst those who thought they were safe from the dark side. He would find the "weak points" of these places, ensuring the dark side took the light's place where-ever it was fading. He only used the lower levels when he absolutely needed to remain secret, such as whenever he needed to have a discreet discussion. Furthermore, he preferred to speak to his pawns via hologram, knowing that his in person presence could be overwhelming to people like Nute Gunray. He instead kept that advantage saved for whenever one of his "allies" was failing him. In public, as Senator of Naboo, he portrayed himself in a perfect state of blandness, looking interested in whatever was said nearby but never showing his true face. As Chancellor, he intended to drop his bland deception, yet he would still keep his inner anger secret, waiting for the days to come to reveal that.<ref name="Queen's Peril" />

After his ascension to Galactic Emperor,<ref name="SWEYoda" /> he essentially dropped his public persona and started living as Sidious full-time.<ref name="SWESidious" /> Despite this, very few people other than Vader and some Royal Guard members knew that the Emperor was a Sith, as he took great pains to hide his capabilities.<ref name="LOTS" /> Even Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, perhaps Sidious' most trusted servant besides Vader, only suspected that Sidious was a Sith.<ref name="Tarkin" /> Sidious also regarded Gallius Rax as a confidante and allowed Rax to address him as "Sheev."<ref name="Aftermath: Life Debt" /> Freed from having to portray his gentle alter-ego, Sidious allowed his true personality, one of great cruelty and sadism, to occasionally shine through in ways that were obvious even to the most sycophantic of his servants. This caused many of those who worked closely with him, such as Senator Orn Free Taa and some of the Empire's intelligence chiefs, to greatly fear him.<ref name="LOTS" /> Sidious was also known to loath ostentation and luxury.<ref name="Tarkin" />

[[File:InSidiousSmile-Revival.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sidious concealed his nature as a Sith by cultivating the facade of a politician devoted to the ideals of the Republic.]]
Among Sidious' most effective traits was his deeply manipulative nature, manipulating and deceiving both the Jedi and Separatists, seducing many parties with promises of power, prize, or even salvation to further his agenda.<ref name="Episode III" /> He enjoyed the rush manipulating others to his will gave him.<ref name="Queen's Hope" /> Even so, he was annoyed by when his pawns, such as Nute Gunray, failed to understand the grand scope of his plans.<ref name="Queen's Peril" /> Nevertheless, he successfully coerced Anakin Skywalker into becoming Darth Vader by promising to save his beloved, Padmé Amidala,<ref name="Episode III" /> attempted to sweet talk Bridger with being able to reunite with his deceased parents by altering fate<ref name="FRAF" /> and also tried to push Luke Skywalker into murdering his father so they could rule the galaxy together.<ref name="Episode VI" /> While trying to steer Bridger, he displayed himself in his public personality via hologram, showing himself as benign and polite. Once Bridger frustrated his plans, his true malignant self was revealed as he had underestimated the boy's hatred for the Empire and devotion to the Rebellion and new-found rebel family.<ref name="FRAF" /> Likewise, when Sidious tried to motivate Luke into killing his father upon momentarily embracing the dark side of the Force, the young Skywalker desisted due to his compassion for his father; his Jedi teachings.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Sidious saw his allies as pawns that he could use for his grand plan, and was more than willing to dispose them if they no longer served a purpose. He kept his allies as long as they served his purpose, but cut them loose when their purpose was over. He never actually cared for any one of his allies. He betrayed countless allies, including Darth Plagueis,<ref name="Episode III" /> Maul,<ref name="Episode I" /> Dooku, the Separatist Council, and Vader.<ref name="Episode III" /> Sidious considered his disposal of Maul justified by his former apprentice's inability to be good enough, even once referring to Maul as an idiot.<ref name="Hidden Empire 1" /> The way he betrayed Dooku, not only showed that he never really cared for him, but also showed how he was always one step ahead. While acknowledging to Vader that he was the ideal apprentice,<ref name="Episode III" /> that did not stop Sidious from later trying to replace him with Luke.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Sidious believed that Vader was incapable of surpassing him and taking the position of Sith Master. He believed that he would always be one of the Sith Lords that made up the Rule of Two, even laughing at the thought of the possibility of Vader becoming the master and Luke the apprentice.<ref name="Vader 2020 47">[[Darth Vader (2020) 47|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 47]]</ref> At the end of the day, Sidious was only out for himself.<ref name="Episode III" />

Sidious considered his manipulation to be a sharp knife that, when stabbed into another, took time for that individual to notice, only realizing they had spread what he deemed to be the infection of his manipulation when it was too late. Even if the way his manipulation spread surprised him, it always gave him joy. Manipulation was ultimately his favorite way to grow his power.<ref name="Queen's Hope" /> Sidious was known for being hypocritical and arrogant; whilst he told Yoda that his arrogance had blinded him when the Jedi Master confronted him, he had previously declared himself to be the Senate when Windu tried to arrest him.<ref name="Episode III" /> Even shortly before his second death years later, Sidious declared himself to be all the Sith while trying to finish off with his Jedi granddaughter.<ref name="Episode IX" />

[[File:Darktimesbegin.png|thumb|right|250px|Darth Sidious was an ambitious Sith Lord who sought to destroy the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic they served.]]
After toppling the Republic and shedding his benevolent persona, Sidious essentially disappeared from public life and left most of the day-to-day affairs of the Empire in the hands of the [[Imperial Ruling Council]]. His absence did not go unnoticed by the citizenry of the Empire, and rumors began to circulate that the Jedi assassination attempt had not only resulted in his disfigurement but in the death of the sanguine politician that he had once been. In order to quash the gossip and rumor-mongering, the Ruling Council took to dispatching skycar processions in Imperial Center in an effort to make it appear as though Sidious still moved about in public.<ref name="Tarkin" />

From his secured position<ref name="TROS VD" /> as Emperor, Sidious devoted most of his time to study and meditation, often in the ancient Sith shrine situated beneath the Imperial Palace. Wishing to rule his Empire for eternity, Sidious launched numerous inquiries into the topic of immortality. One of the most notorious of these was [[Project Blackwing]]; an attempt to unlock the secrets of immortality through Sith alchemy, but the project ended in failure.<ref name="Commander">''[[Star Wars: Commander]]''</ref> However, Sidious' true goal was ultimately to discover a way to use the dark side to manipulate reality itself, and with that power, not only achieve what he termed "mere immortality" but acquire the ability to reshape the galaxy and its people to his satisfaction. Whether or not Sidious made any significant progress in obtaining this goal is not known however, as he would have needed Vader's assistance to perform the sorts of rituals he had in mind.<ref name="Tarkin" /> During the Imperial Era, Darth Sidious sought to gain access to the World between Worlds in order to control time as well as the universe.<ref name="A World Between Worlds" /> Following his first death, Sidious still sought ways to achieve immortality and the preservation of the Sith, as was seen by his attempt to perform a ritual on his granddaughter Rey in order to transfer his spirit into her body, which would allow Sidious to continue the Sith's legacy.<ref name="Episode IX" />

Although Sidious' reign saw a rise in [[alien]] prejudice across the Empire, with [[human]]s being the masters of the galaxy while the other species were enslaved by the Empire,<ref name="Rebels Visual Dictionary">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Visual Guide]]''</ref> Sidious was more than willing to work with aliens. During his rise to power alone, he relied on a number of them, such as the Separatist Council whom he controlled during the Clone Wars, and his political right hand, the [[Chagrian]] Mass Amedda. In addition, Sidious was trained by<ref name="Episode III" /> a Muun,<ref name="Endless">''[[Endless Vigil]]''</ref> Darth Plagueis,<ref name="Episode III" /> and his first apprentice was a Zabrak, Darth Maul.<ref name="Episode I" /> He also used General Grevious as the official commander of the Separatists once Dooku perished.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:SidiousSaber-ROTS.png|thumb|left|250px|As the Emperor, Sidious no longer needed to maintain two identities, and fully embraced his Sith persona in thought and action.]]
To those who had been at his nonexistent mercy, Sidious was known to be exceptionally sadistic, and he often took visible pleasure in torturing others.<ref name="The Lawless" /> He was similarly quite bloodthirsty as well, and frequently reveled in combat to the point of laughing while he fought or killed.<ref name="Episode III" /><ref name="The Lawless" /><ref name="Tarkin" /> He was also noted for his lack of forgiveness, as even Darth Vader, who was well known for summarily executing officers who failed him, considered Sidious to be even less clement than himself.<ref name="Episode VI" /> According to [[Sosha Soruna]], the reason Sidious left his homeworld of Naboo relatively untouched during his reign was because he enjoyed tormenting the populace with the fact that he could destroy the serene beauty of the planet at anytime.<ref name="Shattered Empire 2" /> In spite of his exceptional mastery of the dark arts, he was no less susceptible to fear, one of the primary emotions of the dark side, than any other Sith: after being attacked by a powerful [[Force push]] from Yoda, he displayed visible panic, attempted to flee rather than fight, and only confronted his opponent when he appeared to have no other choice.<ref name="Episode III" /> Despite this, his passion to inflict pain on others and his hate were a priority to him over his own well-being: while he could have used his own powers to save himself from Darth Vader during the Battle of Endor, Sidious' hate was so strong that his only thought was to harm Vader as his apprentice carried him to his first death.<ref name="RotJ:BtPotDS!">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref>

Unlike Darth Vader, his more conservative apprentice, Sidious believed that progress was in no way contrary to the ways of the Sith. When Vader was presented to the cyborgs created by Doctor Cylo, he denounced them as abominations and heresy to the ways of the Force. However, Sidious claimed that he was merely an apprentice and was meant to learn what he knew and that Sidious was meant to discover what there was to teach. He also dismissed Vader's hatred of technological superiority by replying that everything was of the Force.<ref name="Vader 6" />

[[File:Sentinel_BFII.png|thumb|right|250px|Sidious orchestrated the Galactic Empire's destruction, believing it needed to fall in order to rise as a true Sith Empire.]]
Sidious saw the fall of the Galactic Empire as a necessary consequence of his demise; he believed that the Empire had failed to protect its Emperor, despite the vast military at its disposal, and was therefore undeserving of a future without him. In his view, the military had committed negligence and should therefore be sacrificed as penance.<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" /> Using a game of Shah-tezh as an illustration, Sidious believed that the sole purpose for the Empire's existence was to protect his own life and well-being. He believed that the Empire was a failure if it failed to ensure the survival of its Emperor. Even before the formation of the Empire, Sidious had prepared for this fate by formulating a contingency plan. The Contingency involved luring the Empire to the barren Inner Rim planet Jakku and detonating the planet's core. The explosion would destroy both the planet and the orbiting Imperial and enemy fleets,<ref name="Empire's End" /> an outcome which Sidious regarded as retribution for the Empire's failures.<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" /> The key to the Contingency was the Jakku Observatory, which concealed a borehole that penetrated the planet's core, and [[Counselor to the Empire]] Gallius Rax.<ref name="Empire's End" /> Decades after his death, however, Supreme Leader Snoke discovered that the Contingency planned for the Empire's rebirth, secretly constructing shipyards and laboratories in the Unknown Regions in pursuit of this goal.<ref name="TLJ Expanded Edition" />

[[File:SidiousRevealsRey-TROS.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Though confined within a flawed clone, Sidious continued to pursue his plans for power and revenge.]]
Following his demise on Endor and resurrection, in spite of his physical frailness, Sidious' mind was sharper than ever before.<ref name="Sidious' Body" /> Upon realizing that the Jakku scavenger Rey was his granddaughter, Sidious manipulated Kylo Ren into bringing the young woman to him in order to steal her body as a new host. While he tried to sway Rey to his side by claiming that he cared for her, Rey saw through his ruse; by sensing his thoughts, she realized that his motives were fixated purely on his own preservation, indicating that there was no good in it and what was left was pure evil. When it became clear that Rey would not submit to his ritual, Sidious unleashed his fury, trying to kill both her and a redeemed Ben Solo. It was those very same traits of arrogance and selfishness that eventually led to Sidious' final downfall, as he underestimated Rey's true potential when she uses the combined strength of all the Jedi from the past (including Vader's) to finally destroy the Sith Emperor for good. Even after experiencing death, Sidious' beliefs and way of being remained largely unchanged; his sole overriding ambitions were the attainment of unlimited power, a grand empire under his legacy and the perpetuation of a Sith Order embodied through him. He would go to any lengths to realize these goals, including harm his own progeny.<ref name="Episode IX" />

[[File:EmperorsArrival-RotJAVA.png|thumb|right|250px|Sidious' scarred and deformed visage served as a reminder of the price that he paid for unlimited power.]]
Sidious was a human [[Gender|male]] who stood at 1.73 to 1.78 [[meter]]s<ref name="DBPalpatine" /> and weighed 75 [[kilogram]]s.<ref name="SWJB" /> Before his disfigurement, he was a slim man sporting wavy hair, a prominent nose, blue eyes, and a narrow face. By the Invasion of Naboo, his red hair was graying,<ref name="Episode I" /> and it had turned entirely silver ten years later.<ref name="Episode II" /> As he became more embroiled in his plot to control the galaxy, the strain of leading a double life began to show in his face.<ref name="VE">''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''</ref> After his duel with Windu, Sidious' visage was heavily disfigured and withered, with deathly pale, wrinkled skin, flesh sagging from his bulging forehead and around his piercing yellow eyes.<ref name="Episode III" /> Serving as a reminder of his own weakness and mortality,<ref name="VE" /> as well as the price that he paid for power according to Luke Skywalker,<ref name="Secrets of the Jedi" /> the change further fueled his hatred of the Jedi.<ref name="VE" /> His voice was altered to a degree as well, becoming deeper and taking on an edge that many found to be sinister. Tarkin, however, was of the opinion that Sidious' voice merely sounded strained when compared to that of his pre-war persona.<ref name="Tarkin" />

For most of his reign, the Emperor remained away from public view and crafted holograms or idealized portraiture that depicted him in his prime, as he was in the last years of the Galactic Republic.<ref name="SWP" /> Even so, as the reign of the Empire solidified, the citizenry of the galaxy largely forgot the name of "Palpatine," and the man was known simply as "the Emperor."<ref name="longgame">{{InsiderCite|188|The Long Game: The Insidious Plot of Sheev Palpatine}}</ref> When he was discovered on Exegol, Sidious, inhabiting a clone body, appeared to be in a putrid and decaying state. His face appeared similar to what it was prior to his original body's disfigurement, but his skin was more pallid than it was before the transfer, his eyes were white, his lips were blackened, and his fingers had begun to rot away, exposing the bone underneath. Upon draining Rey and Ben Solo of their life energy to restore his own, his appearance more closely resembled what he looked like before his first death.<ref name="Episode IX" />

====Source of power====

As the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious possessed an extremely powerful connection to the Force that allowed him to use various Force powers that were beyond the abilities of even the most powerful Jedi Masters.<ref name="SWEYoda" /> For this he was considered to be one of the most powerful Force-users in galactic history.<ref name="Lightsaber Collection">''[[Star Wars: The Lightsaber Collection]]''</ref> According to Sidious, his power in the dark side came from hatred, which he claimed to turn into power instead of suffering.<ref name="DV 2020 33">[[Darth Vader (2020) 33|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 33]]</ref> However, his power in the dark side took fuel from more than just personal hatred;<ref name="DV 2020 40" /> Sidious was able to use the fear<ref name="DV 2020 41">[[Darth Vader (2020) 41|''Darth Vader'' (2020) 41]]</ref> and hate of others as fuel for his own strength, particularly hate that was directed at himself. As he told Vader during one of his apprentice's rebellions, he thrived off the hatred burning off of Vader. If Vader or anyone else grew in how much they hated the Emperor, those feelings would serve to make Sidious stronger in the dark side: in effect, Vader's efforts to become stronger by increasing his hate for Sidious strengthened his master.<ref name="DV 2020 40" />

Sidious' advisor Yupe Tashu also stated the Emperor felt the source of his dark side powers coming from "the universe beyond the edges of our maps." In search of what Tashu called "the source of the dark side," Sidious sent people out into the unknown space, where they established communication stations and laboratories, over the course of many years.<ref name="Aftermath" />

====Force powers====
{{Quote|Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.|Darth Sidious|audio=AsIHaveForeseen-ROTJ.flac|<ref name="Episode VI" />}}
[[File:DarthSidious-SWGoH.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious was a master practitioner of Force lightning, a dark side power used to torture, disfigure, and kill one's victims.]]
Among the abilities Sidious would use was Force lightning, which he used as both as a deadly attack<ref name="Episode III" /> and as a means of [[torture]].<ref name="Episode VI" /> On several occasions on Ryloth, he utilized blasts of Force lightning powerful enough to not have only killed the lyleks he was attacking on contact, but also badly char and scorch their carapaces, which were tough enough to repel heavy blaster fire. On another occasion, he used the ability to damage a Twi'lek freighter's engines badly enough as to be able to easily pull it out of the sky with telekinesis.<ref name="LOTS" /> Sidious could use Force lightning in a number of ways, including striking multiple enemies at once, with the bolts jumping from one victim to the other, like a chain, and imbuing the ground around a victim's feet with energy, effectively electrocuting them. His Force lightning's raw power was demonstrated to be far greater than that of Dooku's; while Yoda was able to effortlessly absorb and deflect Dooku's lightning, he was only able to partially deflect Sidious'. Another more obscure ability that he possessed was the power to produce a [[Dark Aura]], a miniature storm of malevolent Force energy that slowed the movement of and tortured all that it caught within its radius.<ref name="Battlefront II" /> A greater potential of Sidious' Force lightning, however, was achieved before his final death on Exegol; when restored back to his former self, Sidious unleashed an immense wave of Force lightning towards the sky which rapidly expanded enough to disable all the 14,000 ships of the Resistance and The Galaxy Fleet.<ref name="Episode IX" />

[[File:DunMoch.png|thumb|right|250px|Sidious demonstrated his prowess at telekinesis during his battle with Yoda.]]
He was also highly skilled with telekinesis; during his duel with Yoda,<ref name="Episode III" /> during which the two were equally matched,<ref name="CVD" /> Sidious levitated several Senate pods simultaneously, including the one he was standing on, with great dexterity and accuracy.<ref name="Episode III" /> Likewise, he was skilled enough with telekinesis that he was also able to remove Luke Skywalker's handcuffs while barely having to lift even a finger when they met face to face on the second Death Star.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Sidious was capable of unleashing a Force push strong enough to easily send Maul and Opress flying and he was able to keep them pinned with little effort. He later effortlessly slammed Maul into the ground and walls, badly wounding him. Sidious was also highly skilled with Force choke. When he arrived on Mandalore, he was effortlessly able to telekinetically throttle two Mandalorians to death at once and used this power on two others while standing on the other side of the room that they were in.<ref name="The Lawless" /> He was even able to use his abilities on a target from hundreds of light years away, using only a holo-transmission to show him his target, allowing him to telekinetically choke and pick up Count Dooku and open the handcuffs of Bridger while projecting himself to their respective locations through the use of a hologram.<ref name="TLO" /><ref name="FRAF" /> Shortly after his new apprentice was reconstructed as a [[cyborg]], Sidious managed to protect himself against Vader’s force choke but Vader threw the Emperor against the wall, but Sidious managed to convince Vader to let him go. After Vader did, Sidious shocked his apprentice with bolts of [[Force lightning]]. Sidious then ignited his lightsaber and threatened that if Vader touched him with the Force again, he would finish what Obi-Wan could not.<ref name="Darth Vader 12">[[Darth Vader (2017) 1|''Darth Vader'' (2017) 1]]</ref>

Among Darth Sidious' most powerful abilities was being able foresee the future, an ability which allowed him to plan for nearly any contingency.<ref name="LOTS" /> He believed that, with enough time and practice, he would eventually have been able to use the dark side to view the future with infallible accuracy.<ref name="Tarkin" />

The Dark Lord also was proficient in Sith magic, as he was able to cast a Dark illusion on Yoda using a ritual that applied Balc speech incantations and managed to access the World between Worlds using an unknown ritual. He was also capable of using Sith magic to generate a blue fiery energy, which he used to attack Ezra Bridger and Ahsoka Tano, that he could use both as a weapon and a tool in order to bind and draw someone closer, as it did with Bridger; the energy wrapping around his leg became akin to a tangible rope.<ref name="A World Between Worlds" /> He was also knowledgeable in the ancient Sith tongue, [[ur-Kittât]].<ref name="Sacrifice" /> The Dark Lord was also adept in the use of [[Mind trick|Force Persuade]] to such an extent that he was able to take complete control of a subject's mind and force them to obey his commands.<ref name="LOTS" />

[[File:Force_drained_by_Sidious.png|thumb|left|250px|Through the dark side, Sidious was able to drain power from the dyad of Ben Solo and Rey, restoring his clone vessel to full strength.]]
Likewise, Sidious was also capable of using [[Dark Absorption]].<ref name="SW:FC">''[[Star Wars: Force Collection]]''</ref> He was also capable of telepathically communicating with Darth Vader over a distance of hundreds of light-years. It appeared, however, as though this ability may have been limited to sending and receiving relatively simple messages such as Vader requesting that a starfighter be shipped to him, as the two Sith Lords communicated through holoprojections while discussing more complex matters.<ref name="Tarkin" /> Sidious also had a remarkably keen ability to sense the thoughts and feelings of others, including those of incredibly powerful Force adepts such as Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.<ref name="LOTS" /><ref name="Episode VI" /> On a related note, he was also capable of hiding his own thoughts and feelings from even such individuals as Yoda, and managed to conceal his true dark nature from the entire Jedi Council for decades before deliberately revealing himself.<ref name="Episode III" /> Sidious also used [[Force Dash]] and could move as fast as a "lightning strike".<ref name="LOTS" /> He had the ability to drain the life force of other Force-sensitives such as Ben Solo and Rey, a dyad that he overpowered in the Force despite the physically weakened state of his cloned body. After restoring his strength with the dyad's energy, Sidious demonstrated his proficiency in telekinesis by lifting Solo and throwing him into a chasm.<ref name="Episode IX" />

===Lightsaber skills===
{{Quote|Despite being highly trained in the art of combat by my master, I rarely used these weapons. I preferred to call upon the infinite power of the dark side to win my battles.

[[File:DarthSidious-Platinum2023.png|thumb|right|250px|Sidious possessed considerable skill in the art of lightsaber combat.]]
Darth Sidious was a highly skilled swordsman, having been well trained in the art of [[lightsaber combat]] by his master Darth Plagueis. Although he favored his power in the dark side as his principle form of attack instead of his lightsabers, Sidious attested that only a few individuals were able to survive against his skill with the blade.<ref name="Secrets of the Sith" /> He had an extremely aggressive, rage-fueled dueling style and augmented his swordplay by using Force-enhanced speed, which allowed him to kill three experienced Jedi Masters at once within seconds.<ref name="Episode III" /> He utilized a violently ferocious yet extremely fluid fighting style during his fight with Maul and Savage Opress, holding off the Sith brothers on equal grounds and ultimately separating them by stunning Maul for a brief time with the Force before toying with and killing Opress.<ref name="The Lawless" /> His style was a combination of brutal aggression, extreme speed, and lethal precision.<ref name="Episode III" /> Kit Fisto, a Jedi Master who specialized in combat, was unprepared for the ferocity of Sidious' attack and consequently cut down by the Sith's lightsaber.<ref name="Kit Fisto DB">{{Databank|kit-fisto|Kit Fisto}}</ref>

[[File:PalpatinesLightsaber-Convergence.png|thumb|left|250px|Sidious was as deadly with a single lightsaber as he was with dual sabers.]]
Sidious was able to fight alone against multiple opponents at once, such as the brothers Maul and Opress,<ref name="The Lawless" /> as well as several members of the Jedi High Council.<ref name="Episode III" /> Being proficient in the style of [[Jar'Kai]], he wielded two lightsabers during an intense duel in which he killed Opress and disarmed Maul.<ref name="The Lawless" /> While skilled in dual-wielding lightsabers, Sidious was also adept with a single blade which he used against four Jedi Masters, and later Grand Master Yoda. Upon revealing his true identity to the Jedi, Sidious dispatched three Jedi Masters with haste, killing Agen Kolar and Saesee Tiin with a single blow each, before striking down Kit Fisto only moments later. Unlike the Jedi who fell to Sidious' blade, Mace Windu was able to fight the Dark Lord of the Sith on equal grounds for an extended period of time before ultimately disarming Sidious of his weapon with a kick to the Sith Lord's face.<ref name="Episode III" /> The duel between Sidious and Yoda, both of whom were masters of the Force, was an intense battle in which the Dark Lord ultimately prevailed,<ref name="Yoda BioGal13">{{Databank|yoda-biography-gallery|Yoda Biography Gallery}} (Image 13 caption)</ref> albeit with the use of his Force powers rather than a lightsaber.<ref name="Episode III" />

During a sparring match, Sidious was able to quickly overpower his apprentice Darth Vader and knock Vader's lightsaber out of his hand without much effort.<ref name="The Lesson DV">''{{StoryCite|story=The Lesson (Darth Vader)|book=Star Wars (2020) 25|sformatted=The Lesson (Darth Vader)}}''</ref> He was also skilled in blaster deflection, as he was able to easily deflect every single blaster shot aimed at him when he fought on Ryloth.<ref name="LOTS" /> Soon before the [[Battle at Amaxine Station]], Sidious used his lightsaber to once again spar with his apprentice while conversing about [[Qi'ra]] and her [[War against the Sith|plans]] to destroy the Sith. In their sparing duel Vader manage to last longer than last time.<ref name="Hidden Empire 4">[[Hidden Empire 4|''Hidden Empire'' 4]]</ref>

During the Naboo Crisis, Sidious wore an elaborate blue [[cloak]]. As Supreme Chancellor, he wore golden [[Clothing|robes]] with a [[velvet]] overcloak in the days surrounding the Battle of Geonosis and a dark crimson gigot-sleeved robe in the final days of the Clone Wars. As he rose to power he wore cloaks more fitting with Sith traditions, although without lessening his taste in lavish and comfortable fabrics. When declaring himself Emperor, Sidious wore a red robe patterned with emblems reminiscent of the [[Snake|serpents]] of the planet Moraband. As Galactic Emperor, he later wore a black [[Ghorman twill]] tunic<ref name="Worlds of Andor S2">{{SW|url=news/andor-season-2-world-building-production-design-feature|text=The Secrets of Ghorman, Mina-Rau, and More: Creating the Worlds of ''Andor'' Season 2|archivedate=20250423134540}}</ref> along with a black [[zeyd cloth]] robe with a hood to hide his disfigured face.

==Behind the scenes==
===Conception===
[[File:MCQ-emperor.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Concept art of Darth Sidious by [[Ralph McQuarrie]]]]
From the very beginning of the writing process on the [[1977]] original ''[[Star Wars]]'' film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], director [[George Lucas]] had in mind the character that would eventually develop into the currently known Emperor. One of the earliest documents regarding the project is a paper dating to early [[1973]], which compiled a list of names to potentially use in the story. At the very top of this list appeared the name "Emperor Ford Xerxes XII," as Xerxes was a historical Persian king who was assassinated by his own son, and would be then changed to "Alexander Xerxes XII," then "Emperor of Decarte." None of these mentioned names would be used ultimately.<ref name="The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film">''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref> In the [[The Star Wars rough draft|rough draft]] of the script for [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''A New Hope'']], the [[Emperor (The Star Wars)|Emperor]] is identified as [[Cos Dashit]].<ref name="Rough Draft">{{WebCite|url=https://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/the-star-wars-rough-draft|text=''The Star Wars: Rough Draft''|work=[https://www.starwarz.com/starkiller Starkiller — The Jedi Bendu Script Site]|archivedate=20240601042406}}</ref>

The [[Star Wars: A New Hope (novelization)|novelization]] of ''A New Hope'' describes Palpatine as a weak-willed Senator with delusions of grandeur who was elevated first to President of the Republic and then Emperor, controlled by the Imperial bureaucracy, conformed by ministers like Wilhuff Tarkin. However, he was neither a Force user nor a great political strategist.<ref name="ANH novelization">[[Star Wars: A New Hope (novelization)|''Star Wars: A New Hope'' novelization]]</ref> This concept was superseded by ''The Empire Strikes Back'', which revealed Palpatine to be the mastermind of the events of the ''Star Wars'' saga. Although ''The Empire Strikes Back'' made his Force connection and that he's Darth Vader's master clear,<ref name="Episode V" /> his Sith affiliation (as opposed to just being a dark side user) was first showcased in Legends in [[Empire's End 2|''Empire's End'' 2]], where he asks the ghosts of past Dark Lords of the Sith for help,<ref name="Empire's End 2">[[Empire's End 2|''Empire's End'' 2]]</ref> and then ''The Phantom Menace'' revealed that he was a Dark Lord of the Sith.<ref name="Episode I" />

In the [[original trilogy]], specifically [[1983]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI - ''Return of the Jedi'']], the character was never identified by his surname "Palpatine" or his Sith alter ego "Darth Sidious" on-screen, as he was referred just as "The Emperor" by most characters or "Master" by Darth Vader.<ref name="Episode VI" /> The Emperor's surname was supplied in supplementary materials, including the [[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (novelization)|novelization]] for ''Return of the Jedi''.<ref name="ROTJ novelization">[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (novelization)|''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' novelization]]</ref> It wasn't until the [[1999]] film, [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']], that both his surname and Sith alter ego were first mentioned on-screen.<ref name="Episode I" />

Throughout the original ''Star Wars'' saga films, the character was referred to as either Palpatine or Darth Sidious. The character was not given a full name in any canonical or [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] source until [[2014]], when the character's first name&mdash;Sheev&mdash;was revealed in the canon novel [[Tarkin (novel)|''Tarkin'']] by author [[James Luceno]].<ref name="Tarkin" /> However, according to Luceno in an interview with the podcast ''Full of Sith'', the name was reportedly created by George Lucas for the ''[[Star Wars: Underworld]]'' TV show that he planned to make before budget constraints, his semi-retirement, and [[Lucasfilm]]'s buyout by The Walt Disney Company prevented him to do so.<ref name="Full of Sith Luceno interview">50 min - 52 min mark: {{WebCite|url=http://fullofsith.com/archives/1214|text=Full of Sith|author=Tha Mike|date=2014-11-02|archivedate=20160506161120}}</ref> [[Leland Chee]] has stated that Darth Sidious' name may have derived from the word "insidious."<ref name="Chee">{{Blog|holocron|28|Darth Names and the Darth Who winner revealed.}}</ref>

===Inspiration and creation===
George Lucas compared the story of Darth Sidious to real-life individuals such as [[Wikipedia:Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar]], [[Wikipedia:Napoleon|Napoleon]], [[Wikipedia:Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler]], [[Wikipedia:Benito Mussolini|Benito Mussolini]], [[Wikipedia:Joseph Stalin|Joseph Stalin]], [[Wikipedia:Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand Marcos]], and [[Wikipedia:Alberto Fujimori|Alberto Fujimori]]. All of them used methods similar to the Emperor's while turning their respective democracies into personal dictatorships in real life. The Adolf Hitler similarities are particularly evident from Palpatine's position as Chancellor and the use of emergency powers to cement his hold on the waning Republic as well as his passion for art.<ref name="World War to the Empire">{{SW|url=news/from-world-war-to-star-wars-rise-of-an-empire|text=From World War to ''Star Wars'': Rise of an Empire|nolive=1}}</ref> Palpatine's consolidation of power is also similar to Roman Emperor [[Wikipedia:Augustus|Augustus]], the heir to Casear.<ref name="SW and History">''[[Star Wars and History]]''</ref>

[[Wikipedia:Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon]] was used as the primary political model for the Emperor,<ref name="MakeROTJ" /> both because his presidency was known as the [[Wikipedia:Imperial Presidency|Imperial Presidency]], plus the constitutional crisis caused by the [[Wikipedia:Watergate scandal|Watergate Scandal]].<ref name="Secret History of Star Wars">Kaminski, M.

Not how they're taken over where there's a coup or anything like that, but how the democracy turns itself over to a tyrant."</ref> Lucas, in fact, created the first ''Star Wars'' film as an anti-[[Wikipedia:Vietnam War|Vietnam War]] message, implying that the Empire was what America could have been, had it won the war ten years before 1973.<ref name="Nixonian gangsters">''[[The Making of Star Wars]]''<br />"The empire is like America ten years from now, after Nixonian gangsters assassinated the Emperor and were elevated to power in a rigged election; created civil disorder by instigating race riots aiding rebel groups and allowing the crime rate to rise to the point where a 'total control' police state was welcomed by the people. Then the people were exploited with high taxes, utility and transport costs. Gangsters, a cartel made up of power companies, transport companies & crime organizations. Other companies had to pay bribes to stay in business" The Making of Star Wars: 7-8,17.</ref> Lucas opined, however, that Vice President [[Wikipedia:Dick Cheney|Dick Cheney]] was actually closer to Darth Sidious.<ref>{{WebCite|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/opinion/19dowd.html?ref=opinion|text=The Aura of Arugulance|author=Dowd, Maureen|date=2009-04-19|work=The New York Times|archivedate=20180811172259}}</ref>

[[File:Death.png|thumb|right|160px|Death, from ''The Seventh Seal'']]
In addition, film critic [[Wikipedia:Roger Ebert|Roger Ebert]] and film historian [[Wikipedia:Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] noted that Darth Sidious' appearance resembled Death from the [[1950s#1957|1957]] epic historical film, [[Wikipedia:The Seventh Seal|''The Seventh Seal'']]<ref name="Ebert">Roger Ebert, review of ''Return of the Jedi'', Special Edition, in Chicago ''Sun-Times'', March 14, 1997, available [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970314/REVIEWS/703140303/1023 here]; last accessed August 17, 2006.</ref> and [[W:c:disney:The Evil Queen|Queen Grimhilde's]] witch form in the Disney's [[1930s#1937|1937]] animated film, [[W:c:disney:Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|''Snow White and the Seven Dwarves'']].<ref>Robin Wood, ''Hollywood from Vietnam to Reagan...and Beyond: A Revised and Expanded Edition of the Classic Text'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-231-12966-1}}.</ref> George Lucas himself said that where realistically, and originally, Darth Sidious appeared in a dark color, the Dark Lord of the Sith was brightened-up in post-production to the extent where he became a white-faced figure that resembles Death, a fittingly spooky look desired by Lucas himself.<ref name="HTW-SW">{{YouTube|video=vqnjzVX8EKA|text=How to Watch Star Wars, Part One: The Prequels Are Better Movies Than You Deserve|channel=@rickworley9081|name=Rick Worley}}</ref>

Within, Kempshall connected Palpatine's Operation: Cinder contingency to burn down the Galactic Empire in the event of his demise to Hitler's actions at the close of World War II, pointing out how Hiter had adopted a policy of forcing everyone within the German capital of Berlin to "share in his suicide." Further, he connected Operation Cinder to Hitler's [[Wikipedia:Nero Decree|Nero Decree]] aimed against Germany's own infastructure.<ref name="PoliticsofSW">{{BookCite|author=Doctor [[Chris Kempshall]]|title=The History and Politics of Star Wars: Death Stars and Democracy|publisher=Taylor & Francis|date=2022|isbn=9781351382700}}</ref>

===Ian McDiarmid on Palpatine===
{{Quote|There's a moment in one scene of the new film where tears almost appear in his eye. These are crocodile tears, but for all those in the movie, and perhaps watching the movie itself, they'll see he is apparently moved &mdash; and of course, he is. He can just do it. He can, as it were, turn it on. And I suppose for him, it's also a bit of a turn-on &mdash; the pure exercise of power is what he's all about. That's the only thing he's interested in and the only thing that can satisfy him &mdash; which makes him completely fascinating to play, because it is an evil soul. He is more evil than the devil. At least Satan fell &mdash; he has a history, and it's one of revenge. But the Emperor &mdash; well, I don't know all the details, but who does of the Sith? &mdash; is an independent agent who just lives for the exercise of power. He doesn't know what scruples are, let alone have any. The only emotion that manifests itself truly is the one seen just before he meets his end, if that's what he meets, in ''Jedi'' &mdash; and then that's pure anger, when he realizes that he hasn't succeeded in manipulating young Skywalker. So he has to kill him, and he tries to do that with unadulterated fury.|Ian McDiarmid on Palpatine in 2002|<ref name="Exercise of Power">{{SWArchive|url=episode-ii/bts/profile/f20020124/index.html|text=Ian McDiarmid: Dark Force Rising|date=2002-01-24}}</ref>}}
Darth Sidious, namely the Emperor at that time, was mentioned in ''A New Hope''.<ref name="Episode IV" /> The Emperor first appeared in the [[1980]] sequel [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']], played by the experienced actress [[Marjorie Eaton]].<ref name="Episode V" /> In ''Return of the Jedi'', the Emperor was played by [[Ian McDiarmid]]. McDiarmid then reprised the role for the three films of the prequel trilogy, as well as in ''The Rise of Skywalker'' in the sequel trilogy.<ref name="Episode I" /><ref name="Episode II" /><ref name="Episode III" /><ref name="Episode IX" /> Speaking about Palpatine in promotion for the prequel film [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']], McDiarmid stated Palpatine was more evil than the [[Wikipedia:Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] figure [[Wikipedia:Satan|Satan]] because "at least Satan fell." Whereas the Abrahamic Devil is a figure who fell from grace and thus has a motivation in wanting revenge, McDiarmid&mdash;while unsure of the full story behind Palpatine due to the secrecy surrounding the Sith Order&mdash;defined Palpatine as an "independent agent" whose only motivation was to exercise power. Whereas Satan could be written as both evil and sympathetic, as he noted writer [[Wikipedia:John Milton|John Milton]] accomplished by depicting the Devil as a tormented soul in the epic poem ''[[Wikipedia:Paradise Lost|Paradise Lost]]'', McDiarmid believed Palpatine never "fell" and instead thought of the future Galactic Emperor as someone who was "evil from birth."<ref name="Exercise of Power" />

He further defined Palpatine as "an evil soul" and someone who did not have scruples, not that Palpatine knew what scruples were in the first place. In his view, the only thing that could satisfy Palpatine was the "pure exercise of power," and he stated the character's only true emotion was "pure anger." McDiarmid pointed to Palpatine's demise in ''Return of the Jedi'' as proof, noting how his character showcased nothing but rage when he fails to turn Luke Skywalker to the dark side of the Force. With that failure, he cited, Palpatine believed the young Jedi had to die and tried to do so with a level of "unadulterated fury."<ref name="Exercise of Power" /> In [[2023]], McDiarmid, while acknowledging his past remarks, theorized Palpatine had a "complicated" childhood and that he had indeed been twisted to evil, pondering if "various things" had "twisted him into the way that he wanted." He defined Palpatine as someone "who had to win," remarking that "the word loser" would likely be "the worst thing he could ever hear," which he compared to "a certain contemporary politician."<ref name="Sequel Villains">{{YouTube|channel=@DisneylandExperience|name=Disneyland Experience|video=A5Ie2E2Ra-Q|text=Villains of the Sequel Trilogy Panel Full – Star Wars Celebration 2023}}</ref>

[[File:Palpatine_concept.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Nilo Rodis-Jamero]]'s costume concept art for the Emperor in ''Return of the Jedi'']]
For ''Return of the Jedi'', the role of the Emperor was to be played by veteran thespian [[Alan Webb]], who was 75 years old at the time. However, as filming was about to commence, Webb fell ill due to the record cold [[Wikipedia:England|England]] was experiencing at the time. He wrote a letter to the director [[Richard Marquand]], saying that he was very sorry, but that he felt the part was too big for him, shortly dying afterward on [[June 22]], [[1982]]. English actor [[Wikipedia: Ben Kingsley|Ben Kingsley]] read then for the role but was considered "very English" for playing the Emperor. With filming behind schedule, Ian McDiarmid was drafted in as a late substitute.<ref name="MakeROTJ">''[[The Making of Return of the Jedi]]''</ref>

For the prequel trilogy, McDiarmid reprised the role for all three films, playing a younger Chancellor Palpatine in ''The Phantom Menace'' and a middle-aged Palpatine in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] and in ''Revenge of the Sith''. He became at first surprised that Lucas asked him to reprise the role, as he supposed that Darth Sidious would be played by a young actor, but he accepted the offer and returned for the role once more.<ref name="Episode I" /><ref name="Episode II" /><ref name="Episode III" /> One of the things that George told McDiarmid about playing the young Palpatine was to imagine that his face was a mask that was hiding the monster's face, which made him portray him a seemingly friendly man who was always nice to people.<ref>{{YouTube|channel=@DisneylandExperience|name=Disneyland Experience|video=58xjtNARA4E|text=Ian McDiarmid Interview - Star Wars Celebration 2017 Orlando}}</ref> Wanting to give Palpatine and Yoda's duel in ''Revenge of the Sith'' a more formal resolution that she felt was missing in the ''Star Wars'' saga itself, author [[Tessa Gratton]] was inspired to write the short story "[[Masters]]."<ref name="Quest for Answers">{{InsiderCite|221|The Quest for Answers}}</ref>

For the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]]<ref name="TCW film" /> and subsequent [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars|TV show]], Darth Sidious was voiced by veteran actor [[Ian Abercrombie]].<ref name="Bombad Jedi" /> In the Creative Conservation commentary on the film's Blu-ray and audio commentary on the film's DVD, Director [[Dave Filoni]] noted that he found the fact that Palpatine and Jabba the Hutt were talking to each other fascinating. It was a character dynamic that he never thought would be seen.<ref name="SW:TCW Film Blu-ray Commentary">The [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]] Blu-ray Creative Conversation commentary and DVD audio commentary are the same.</ref> Abercrombie passed away on [[January 26]], [[2012]], leading to actor [[Tim Curry]] replacing him in the final seconds of "[[The Lawless]]"<ref name="The Lawless" /> as well as the remaining episodes of the series, for which he was credited, beginning the fifth season finale "[[The Wrong Jedi]]."<ref name="The Wrong Jedi" />

For ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', Sidious was voiced by ''Star Wars'' veteran [[Sam Witwer]] in "[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal|The Siege of Lothal]]," the show's [[Star Wars Rebels Season Two|second season]] premiere episode. For the [[Star Wars Rebels Season Four|fourth and final season]] of the show, McDiarmid returned to provide the Emperor's voice instead, as well as subsequently re-recorded Witwer's dialogue from the second season premiere. McDiarmid returned once more to the role for ''[[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi (television series)|Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi]]''.

[[Stuart Beattie]] wrote the script for the first of three Obi-Wan Kenobi feature films. From the beginning of Beattie's story, Emperor Palpatine would tell Vader to forget Kenobi and focus on the present problems. In one scene, Palpatine sent Vader to crush a rebel uprising and he was trying to forget Kenobi. Vader later told Palpatine that Kenobi and Yoda were the two biggest threats, causing Palpatine to get angry and remind Vader of his place.<ref name="Vader originally won battle">{{WebCite|url=https://thedirect.com/article/obi-wan-kenobi-darth-vader-final-battle-exclusive|text=Darth Vader Originally Won Obi-Wan Kenobi's Final Battle (Exclusive)|author=Johnson, Nathan|date=2022-07-06|archivedate=20220706175516}}</ref> McDiarmid reprised the role for the [[Part VI|sixth episode]] of the television series [[Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi|''Obi-Wan Kenobi'']].<ref name="Part VI" /> [[David Decio]] was the [[Wikipedia:Body double (disambiguation)|double]] and [[Wikipedia:Stand-in|stand-in]] for McDiarmid.<ref name="David Decio Tweet">{{Twitter|DavidDecio|status/1558034117857533953|[[David Decio]]|quote=Happy Birthday Ian.

I enjoyed our time working together.|archivedate=20220924213653}}</ref> McDiarmid's scene was filmed against a blue screen. Director [[Deborah Chow]] wanted Palpatine to tell Vader that his obsession with Kenobi is a weakness. She told McDiarmid to film his scene between being on an edge and having some lines be more casual. McDiarmid struggled with remembering to use the word "execute" during filming.<ref name="Return">''[[Obi-Wan Kenobi: A Jedi's Return]]''</ref>

===Deleted scenes===
Palpatine's efforts to centralize power and subvert democracy initially saw a wider discussion in ''Revenge of the Sith'', particularly through the "Rebel Alliance subplot."<ref name="A Stirring in the Senate">{{Film|III}} DVD, A Stirring in the Senate (Bail's Office) deleted scene</ref> Firstly, Palpatine and Skywalker would have had a scene in the Chancellor's office where Palpatine reveals the Senate would, that afternoon, ask him to take direct control over the Jedi Council's affairs, defending the choice by saying it was another adjustment to the constitution in the name of security. While Skywalker agreed in taking power over the Council from the unfocused Senate in the name of winning the war, he warns his old friend of the Council's growing upset at constitutional changes. Claiming he had no choice but to take on the additional power, Palpatine quickly changes the conversation to his history with Skywalker before making him question the Council, claiming they see his growing power in the Force as a threat.<ref name="Changes to Constitution">''[[Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'', Changes to Constitution deleted scene</ref>

The Rebel Alliance subplot began with Organa and Mothma establishing the Delegation of 2,000 in the name of opposing the Chancellor's increased power. In Organa's apartment, it is noted that Palpatine has regularly passed amendments to the constitution, taken personal control over the Jedi Council, and, as of that morning, appointed governors to oversee Republic star systems, effectively subverting the Senate's authority. Although surprised that one of her oldest advisors would act in such a non-democratic manner, Amidala becomes part of the Delegation.<ref name="A Stirring in the Senate" /> After a meeting in Amidala's apartment, where the gathered legislators decide their new alliance would be focused on the Senate instead of going to the Jedi right away,<ref name="Seeds of Rebellion">{{Film|III}} DVD, Seeds of Rebellion (Padmé's Apartment) deleted scene</ref> Palpatine and Skywalker were confronted by a gathering of the Delegation in the Chancellor's office, where Amidala speaks on behalf of the gathered against Palpatine's conduct.<ref name="Confronting the Chancellor">{{Film|III}} DVD, Confronting the Chancellor (Palpatine's Office) deleted scene</ref>

Cutting off [[Fang Zar]]'s attempt at a comment and bidding the group farewell, Palpatine continues to tempt Skywalker to the dark side by claiming the group, even Amidala, has ulterior motives and can not be trusted. Although Skywalker attempts to defend his secret wife, Palpatine pries at the conflicted Jedi's emotional armor by claiming he simply does not want to admit it is possible.<ref name="Confronting the Chancellor" /> The Delegation of the 2,000 and Palpatine's Sector Governance Decree have since been confirmed to be canon.<ref name="The Rebel Files" /> Palpatine's manipulation of Skywalker from<ref name="The Long Game">{{InsiderCite|188|The Long Game: The Insidious Plot of Sheev Palpatine}}</ref> the Delegation meeting in Chancellor's office deleted scene<ref name="Confronting the Chancellor" /> was mentioned within "[[The Long Game: The Insidious Plot of Sheev Palpatine|The Long Game]]," an article about Palpatine's rise to power written by [[Michael Kogge]] for [[Star Wars Insider 188|''Star Wars Insider'' 188]], as a canonical quote.<ref name="The Long Game" />

Another deleted scene sees Windu, Kenobi, and Yoda discuss Palpatine's effort to take control of the Jedi Council and whether they must move against him.<ref name="A Plot to Destroy the Jedi">{{Film|III}} DVD, A Plot to Destroy the Jedi? deleted scene</ref> In the original story treatment for ''Revenge of the Sith'', Darth Sidious was intended to reveal that he created Anakin Skywalker through the midi-chlorians, thus making him, in some way, Anakin's father,<ref name="I'm Your Father">''[[The Making of Star Wars Revenge of the Sith]]'', page 42<br />"On Coruscant, PALPATINE completes his seduction of ANAKIN, who at first refuses to go over to the dark side-- until the Chancellor makes a startling confession:"<br />
<br />
 DARTH SIDIOUS-- "I have waited all these years for you to fulfill your destiny... I arranged for your conception. I used the power of the Force to will the midichlorians to start the cell divisions that created you."<br />
<br />
 ANAKIN-- "I don't believe you."<br />
<br />
 DARTH SIDIOUS-- "Ahhh, but you know it's true. When you clear your mind, you will sense the truth. you could almost think of me as your father."<br />
<br />
 ANAKIN-- "That's impossible!"<br />
<br />
 DARTH SIDIOUS-- "Nevertheless, you must decide."</ref> although George Lucas ultimately cut this out of the film.<ref name="Palpatine fatherhood cut">''[[The Making of Star Wars Revenge of the Sith]]''</ref> Although Darth Sidious and/or Darth Plagueis's attempts to meddle with medichlorians is noted in the film, the idea that Sidious created Skywalker was dropped from the final cut.<ref name="Episode III" />

===Debates and discrepancies===
====Visual appearances====
{{Quote|The strain of all this exertion is what's transforming him into the Emperor that we see later in Return of the Jedi.|John Knoll in the {{Film|III}} DVD commentary|<ref name="DVD">{{FilmVideo|3}}</ref>}}
One known debate about Darth Sidious is his real appearance. In ''Revenge of the Sith'', during his duel against Mace Windu, upon being disarmed, Sidious uses Force lightning against the Jedi Master, but he deflects it back to him, causing his face to be disfigured and scarred in the process. Later on, when Anakin cuts Windu's hand to succor Sidious, he electrocuted Windu, knocking him off the window to his death, although the Force lightning doesn't disfigure Windu for the short period of time it is used.<ref name="Episode III" />

However, previous to the Force lightning's appearance in ''Revenge of the Sith'', when it first appeared in ''Return of the Jedi'', Sidious used it against Luke Skywalker, and it did not disfigure or scar Skywalker.<ref name="Episode VI" /> In the DVD commentary for ''Revenge of the Sith'', [[John Knoll]] said, "The strain of all this exertion is what's transforming him into the Emperor that we see later in Return of the Jedi."<ref name="DVD" /> Similarly, [[Matt Martin]] of the [[Lucasfilm Story Group]] proposed that Palpatine used a higher voltage count for his lightning when attacking Windu, or there was more going on with Palpatine, such the Sith Lord overexerting himself and causing that appearance.<ref name="Matt's Explanation">{{Twitter|missingwords|status/1034554469596319746|[[Matt Martin]]|quote=This is not an official answer but I just always assumed there was more going on with Palps and it wasn't just a result of the lightning itself. Maybe he overexerted himself and that caused it? Maybe he had the voltage turned up higher? IDK, but I never saw it as an inconsistency|archiveurl=https://archive.is/790hW}}</ref> Author [[Gary M. Sarli]] proposed in 2005 that Palpatine had been using a [[Sith alchemy/Legends|Sith alchemy]] technique known as [[Mask (Sith Alchemy)|masking]] to hide his true appearance, with the Force lightning wiping the mask away. Sarli further theorized that Sidious decided to not save his mask in order to further convince Skywalker he needed to intervene and to claim he was scarred to the Senate.<ref name="Jedi Counseling 71">{{Wizards|url=default.asp?x=starwars/article/sw20050804jc71|series=Jedi Counseling|text=71}}</ref>

====Other discrepancies====
Sidious' height has been stated to either be 1.73 meters,<ref name="DBPalpatine" /><ref name="SWEPalpatine" /> or 1.78 meters.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref><ref name="SWESidious" /> This article assumes the newer databank entry height on StarWars.com to be the correct height.<ref name="DBPalpatine" />

In a question and answer session for [[The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions|''The Clone Wars'': The Lost Missions]], Dave Filoni stated that Sidious had Darth Maul and Darth Tyranus as apprentices at the same time.<ref name="TCW Lost Missions Q&A" /> However, Sidious' biography gallery in the [[Databank (2014-)|Databank]] claimed that he recruited Dooku into the Sith during his time as Supreme Chancellor after<ref name="Sidious BioGal5">{{Databank|darth-sidious-biography-gallery|Darth Sidious Biography Gallery}} {{C|Image 5 caption}}</ref> the Invasion of Naboo.<ref name="Sidious BioGal 2, 3, and 4">{{Databank|darth-sidious-biography-gallery|Darth Sidious Biography Gallery}} {{C|Images 2 through 4 captions}}</ref> Maul was thought to be killed during that event.<ref name="Episode I" /> However, "[[The Lost One]]" establishes that Dooku, in some form, must have joined the Sith before ''The Phantom Menace'';<ref name="TLO" /> Finis Valorum loses his position as Supreme Chancellor within that movie,<ref name="Episode I" /> yet Dooku had Sifo-Dyas killed for the Sith Plan during Valorum's chancellery.<ref name="TLO" /> The ''Tales of the Jedi'' episode "[[The Sith Lord]]" would address the issue directly by showing Dooku had joined Sidious by the time of ''The Phantom Menace'', but he had yet to fully fall to the dark side and become Sidious' pupil until the episode's events.<ref name="The Sith Lord" />

[[File:Public_enemies.png|thumb|right|240px|Darth Sidious, in [[LEGO]] form]]
In the non-canon ''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures]]'', Darth Sidious was voiced by [[Trevor Devall]]. In the [[LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures Season One|first season]], Sidious and Darth Vader learned about the history of a powerful lightsaber called the [[Kyber Saber]], which was made out of several kyber crystals. However, the Jedi Master who crafted the sword had deemed it too dangerous and destroyed the lightsaber before scattering all of the crystals throughout the galaxy. Seeking to destroy the galaxy in one blast, Darth Sidious attempted to collect all of the crystals. He and Vader dispatched the Sith agent [[Naare]] to recover the Kyber Saber crystals. However, Naare's mission was complicated by her encounter with the Force-sensitive [[Rowan Freemaker/LEGO|Rowan Freemaker]] and [[Freemakers/LEGO|his family]]. In an attempt to gain the crystals, Naare pretended to be a Jedi and offered to train him in the ways of the Force.<ref name="A Hero Discovered">{{FreemakerAdventures|A Hero Discovered}}</ref> Despite Sidious' efforts, the Sith Lord failed to take the Kyber Saber from Rowan, who managed to destroy the weapon.<ref name="Return of the Kyber Saber">{{FreemakerAdventures|Return of the Kyber Saber}}</ref>

In the [[LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures Season Two|second season]], Darth Sidious creates an Imperial [[Hunter droid/LEGO|hunter droid]] called [[M-OC/LEGO|M-OC]], whom he tasks with hunting down Rowan.<ref name="Trouble on Tibalt">{{FreemakerAdventures|Trouble on Tibalt}}</ref> This arouses the jealousy of Darth Vader, who undermines M-OC's efforts on several occasions. Despite failing to capture the Freemakers on several occasions, M-OC manages to deflect blame by pointing out that Lord Vader obstructed his efforts to obtain an [[XX-23 S-thread tracker]].<ref name="TPATP">{{FreemakerAdventures|The Pit and the Pinnacle}}</ref> After Rowan builds a powerful starship called the [[Arrowhead (Freemakers)|''Arrowhead'']], Sidious forces Vader and M-OC to work together. M-OC lures Rowan into a [[Capture of Rowan Freemaker|trap]] on [[Qalydon]] but Vader outsmarts the droid and brings him to the Emperor.<ref name="A Perilous Rescue">{{FreemakerAdventures|A Perilous Rescue}}</ref>

In Imperial captivity, Rowan reveals that he destroyed the Kyber Saber. Though the Emperor wants to kill Rowan, Vader convinces the Emperor that Rowan can help them find more kyber crystals to power up the second Death Star. After Vader forces Rowan to reveal the location through a mind probe, the Emperor deems that Rowan has outlived his usefulness and orders his execution. However, Rowan is [[Rescue of Rowan Freemaker|rescued]] by his siblings. Meanwhile, M-OC rebuilds himself and steals the ''Arrowhead'' from the Freemakers, currying the Emperor's favor. The Emperor orders M-OC to hunt down the Freemakers.<ref name="Escape from Coruscant">{{FreemakerAdventures|Escape from Coruscant}}</ref>

Following a [[Skirmish on Shantipole|skirmish]] on Shantipole, Rowan convinces M-OC that his programming is flawed.<ref name="Free Fall">{{FreemakerAdventures|Free Fall}}</ref> M-OC instead deduces there is a flaw in the second Death Star and rushes to the [[Endor system]]. However, M-OC's warnings fall on deaf ears since the Emperor is preoccupied with Luke Skywalker. Later, M-OC is distracted when he watched the Emperor falling to his death, allowing Rowan to defeat him once and for all by plunging the Kyber Saber into the Kyber crystal mounted on M-OC's back. What ensued was an explosion that disintergrated both the Kyber Saber and M-OC.<ref name="ROTROTJ">{{FreemakerAdventures|Return of the Return of the Jedi}}</ref>

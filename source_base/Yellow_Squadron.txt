==History==
===Jake Farrell===
After quitting as a [[flight instructor]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], the [[human]] [[Jake Farrell]] retired to [[Derango 4]] but joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebellion]] shortly afterward, serving its Yellow Squadron under the [[callsign]] "[[Yellow Seven]]" with a modified [[R-22 Spearhead]] [[starfighter]]. By the [[time]] of the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]], Farrell served in the rebel [[Gold Squadron]] flying an [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor]].<ref name="Encyclopedia">{{EncyclopediaCite|Pilots of the Rebel Alliance}}</ref>

===Battle of Vrogas Vas===

[[File:DogfightVrogasVas-VaderDown1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Yellow Squadron in combat with Darth Vader]]
In [[0 ABY]],<ref name="Date" /> Yellow Squadron, along with [[Blue Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Blue Squadron]] and [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Squadron]], were drilling over Vrogas Vas, when an Imperial scout ship dropped out of [[hyperspace]] right in front of them. With three squadrons of [[X-wing starfighter|X-wings]] versus one TIE, the odds seemed to be in the Rebel Alliance's favor. Drills now cancelled, the pilots of Blue Squadron took the lead and started their attack on the lonely ship, commencing the [[Battle of Vrogas Vas]]. Not realizing that it was [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] in a [[TIE Advanced x1]] with [[deflector shield]]s and [[torpedo]]es, the entire squadron was destroyed without so much as a scratch to Vader's own ship. Shocked at the loss of Blue Squadron, Yellow Squadron decided to coordinate fire using torpedoes. All locked and fired, the torpedoes veered off course, then Vader destroyed Yellow Squadron. [[Luke Skywalker]], who was flying as [[Red Five]] with the only remaining pilots of Red Squadron, sensed it was Vader. Not convinced another coordinated attack would work, flew his own [[Red Five (T-65B X-wing starfighter)|X-wing]] into Vader's TIE and both crashed onto the planet below. Both pilots survived the crash and the battle continued on the planet below, with further losses to [[Gray Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gray Squadron]],<ref name="Vader Down 1" /> [[Amber Wing]],<ref name="DV14">[[Darth Vader (2015) 14|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 14]]</ref> and [[Cyan Squadron]].<ref name="Vader Down 2">[[Darth Vader (2015) 13|''Darth Vader'' (2015) 13]]</ref>

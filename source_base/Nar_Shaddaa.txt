'''Nar Shaddaa''', nicknamed the "'''Smuggler's Moon'''," was the notorious [[moon]] of the [[planet]] [[Nal Hutta]], [[homeworld]] of the [[Hutt]] [[species]]. It was home to a large criminal underworld dominated by [[bounty hunter]]s and Hutt [[crime lord]]s. An [[ecumenopolis]], the entire surface of Nar Shaddaa was covered in urban sprawl. It was the homeworld of the [[Palliduvan]] bounty hunter [[Aurra Sing]] and the [[Jablogian]] [[enslaver]] [[Azmorigan]].

==Description==
{{Quote|Food. Gambling. Entertainment. Come to Nar Shaddaa for a night you will never forget.|translated=1|A Huttese advertisment for Nar Shaddaa played on board the ''Morenia''|audio=NarShaddaa-WildCard.flac|<ref name="Outlaws">''[[Star Wars Outlaws]]''</ref>}}
Nar Shaddaa was the largest [[moon]] of the [[planet]] [[Nal Hutta]], which was located in the [[Hutt Space]] region of the [[Outer Rim Territories]].<ref name="BtMF" /> An [[ecumenopolis]], its surface was covered entirely in urban sprawl. Its city lights were visible from space.<ref name="Star Wars 8" /> The [[capital]] of Nar Shaddaa was [[Hutta Town]], which was made up of huge tower blocks with a patchwork of shanty town structures called [[skyslum]]s filling every available space between the towers.<ref name="BtMF" /> It was ruled by [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the Hutt.<ref name="Star Wars 9" /> Other settlements included [[Wormstew Town]],<ref name="Star Wars 34" /> and the [[Corellian Sector (Nar Shaddaa)|Corellian Sector]].<ref name="Smuggler's Guide" /> Some known locations on Nar Shaddaa including the [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt]], which hosted a gladiatorial arena, a [[Unidentified bar (Nar Shaddaa)|seedy bar]] owned by an [[Unidentified Zabrak bartender|unscrupulous Zabrak bartender]],<ref name="Star Wars 8" /> and [[Wormstew Town hospital]].<ref name="Star Wars 34" />

==Society and culture==
{{Quote|It's an entire world of pirates and outlaws.|Luke Skywalker|<ref name="Star Wars 8" />}}
By the time of the [[Galactic Civil War]], Nar Shaddaa had a reputation as a haven for pirates and outlaws.<ref name="Star Wars 8" /> Seen as a negative version of the ecumenopolis [[Coruscant]], Nar Shaddaa was known for being polluted and possibly one of the most dangerous places in [[the galaxy]], as its inhabitants embraced almost every sort of illegal activity with almost no interference from [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or officials of any galactic government.<ref name="BtMF" /> The [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] considered the moon so dangerous that they regarded even sending a covert team there as suicide.<ref name="Star Wars 9" />

The [[Hutt Clan]] controlled Nar Shaddaa, but maintained only the lightest touch in governing the population, ensuring only that they got a cut from a deal or transaction on the moon. The majority of beings on the moon understood that staying on the good side of the Hutts was essential to surviving on Nar Shaddaa, although it far from guaranteed safety. Unofficially, the different territories on the moon were divided between various Hutt [[crime lord]]s as well as other criminal cartels or gangs. The Hutts of Nal Hutta conducted almost all of their offworld dealings on Nar Shaddaa, meaning there were few visitors to the planet itself.<ref name="BtMF" />

Gangs of [[droid]]s also roamed the streets of Nar Shaddaa, accosting other droids such as [[C-3PO]] for scrap metal.<ref name="Star Wars 10">[[Star Wars (2015) 10|''Star Wars'' (2015) 10]]</ref> Some forms of entertainment on Nar Shaddaa included bars and an arena run by Grakkus the Hutt which pitted [[Wookiee]]s, "lizard men," pirates, and other prisoners against various wild beasts.<ref name="Star Wars 11" />

==History==
===Galactic Republic===
{{Quote|Through the Force, a Jedi can endure even the most debilitating pain. Remember the Battle of Nar Shaddaa. Master Crucitorn fought on even after being immolated by the Flame-Wielders.|Dooku|<ref name="Dooku: Jedi Lost">''[[Dooku: Jedi Lost]]''</ref>}}
At some point, [[Jedi Master]] [[Crucitorn]] participated in the [[Battle of Nar Shaddaa]]. Though the [[Jedi]]'s opponents in the battle, the [[Flame-Wielders]], greatly injured Crucitorn, the Jedi Master fought on. Thus, Crucitorn's actions on Nar Shaddaa were immortalized by the [[Jedi Order]], with [[Dooku]] telling his [[Padawan]], [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], of the Master's actions.<ref name="Dooku: Jedi Lost" />

During the [[High Republic Era]], [[Nihil]] [[Tempest Runner]] [[Lourna Dee]] knew a [[Unidentified poisoner|poisoner]] on Nar Shaddaa who formulated a [[Lourna Dee's nerve toxin|special]] [[nerve toxin]] for her.<ref name="LOTJ">''[[The High Republic: Light of the Jedi]]''</ref>

[[File:NarShaddaa-2017DarthMaul2.jpg|250px|thumb|Darth Maul arrives on Nar Shaddaa]]
In [[33 BBY]], the [[Sith apprentice]] [[Maul|Darth Maul]] went to a bar on Nar Shaddaa. There, he tried to get information on [[Xev Xrexus]]'s [[Xrexus Cartel|Cartel's]] [[Auction of Eldra Kaitis|auction]] of Padawan [[Eldra Kaitis]]. Maul, however, got into a [[Altercation on Nar Shaddaa|brawl]] when the patrons thought he was a Jedi, but he was soon aided by a [[Cad Bane's group|group]] of [[bounty hunter]]s led by [[Cad Bane]].<ref name="Darth Maul 2">[[Darth Maul (2017) 2|''Darth Maul'' (2017) 2]]</ref>

[[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] carried the newborn [[Luke Skywalker]] onboard the late [[General]] [[Grievous]]'s [[starfighter]], the ''[[Soulless One]]'', and flew to Nar Shaddaa, where he sold it for passage to the planet [[Tatooine]].<ref name="English Ships (2)">{{EncyclopediaCite|Republic and Separatist Ships (2)}} (English version)</ref>

===Galactic Empire===
====Grakkus' domain====
Following the [[Great Jedi Purge]], the Hutt crime lord Grakkus amassed a collection of [[Jedi]] relics including [[holocron]]s, [[lightsaber]]s, statues, and a Jedi starfighter at his palace in Hutta Town.<ref name="Star Wars 9" /> Grakkus also made a living forcing captured Wookiees, lizard men, and [[pirate]]s to fight in his gladiatorial arena against various wild beasts including the [[roggwart]] [[Kongo]].<ref name="Star Wars 11" /> The slaves were trained by the enigmatic [[Kreel|Gamemaster]], an undercover [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] spy named [[Sergeant]] Kreel who monitored Grakkus' Jedi collection.<ref name="Star Wars 12">[[Star Wars (2015) 12|''Star Wars'' (2015) 12]]</ref>

====Skywalker's misadventure====
During the Galactic Civil War in [[0 ABY]], Luke Skywalker and [[R2-D2]] traveled to Nar Shaddaa seeking a means to enter the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] on Coruscant. He visited a seedy bar owned by a Zabrak bartender, who attempted to take [[Skywalker lightsaber|his lightsaber]] and kill him. However, Skywalker's lightsaber was stolen by an [[Unidentified lightsaber thief (Nar Shaddaa)|alien thief]], who served the crime lord Grakkus.<ref name="Star Wars 8" />

Skywalker pursued the thief but was captured by Grakkus, who forced him to take part in gladiatorial combat. R2-D2 alerted the Rebel Alliance, who dispatched [[Chewbacca]] and C-3PO to rescue him.<ref name="Star Wars 9" /> Grakkus intended to force Skywalker to fight to the death in his arena and tasked Gamemaster with training him. Meanwhile, Chewbacca and C-3PO traced Skywalker's footsteps, roughing up and questioning the Zabrak bartender and his customers. The bartender revealed that Skywalker was a prisoner of Grakkus.<ref name="Star Wars 10" />

Before Chewbacca and C-3PO could rescue Skywalker, they were ambushed by [[Dengar]], who wanted to collect [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba's]] bounty on Solo and Chewbacca. Meanwhile, Skywalker was forced to fight against Kongo the Dissolver. Seeking to bring Skywalker into Imperial custody, Gamemaster secretly contacted a squadron of [[Imperial Starfighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilots]].<ref name="Star Wars 11" /> [[Han Solo]] and [[Princess]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] rescued Chewbacca and C-3PO with the help of Solo's partner in crime [[Sana Starros]].<ref name="Star Wars 12" />

Meanwhile, Kreel and his TIE fighter pilots incapacitated Kongo and arrested Grakkus. Before they could take Grakkus and Skywalker into custody, Grakkus activated an electromagnetic pulse bomb and attacked the Imperials. The EMP bomb also disabled Kongo's shock collar, sending the roggwart on a rampage. Armed with lightsabers, Solo, Leia, and Chewbacca rescued Skywalker. Together with Starros, they then escaped Nar Shaddaa in the ''Falcon'' and ''[[Volt Cobra]]''. Imperial reinforcements arrived in the form of [[stormtrooper]]s and arrested Grakkus. [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] then questioned Kreel about everything he knew about the "boy."<ref name="Star Wars 12" />

===New Republic era===
In [[5 ABY]], the bounty hunter [[Jas Emari]] and the [[New Republic]] soldier [[Jom Barell]] traveled to Nar Shaddaa as part of their mission to search for Han Solo. While on the moon, the two were ambushed by [[underboss]] [[Rynscar]], who wanted to capture Emari for debts that she owed to [[Boss]] [[Gyuti]], the leader of [[Black Sun]]. Jas managed to convince Gyuti to let them go in return for paying twice the amount of debts that she owed. Rynscar also provided the two with information that Solo was on the [[Wild Space]] world of [[Irudiru]].<ref name="Life Debt" />

[[Standard decade|Decades]] after the [[Battle of Jakku]], surviving Imperial remnants reformed into the [[First Order]]. Nar Shaddaa was an available location for [[First Order officer]]s requesting shore leave.<ref name="TLJ:EE">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
Nar Shaddaa was first [[canon]]ically mentioned in the eighth chapter of the [[Star Wars video games|video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Commander]]''. Though it was spelled correctly there, a later released campaign titled ''Echoes of the Force'' spells the moon as Nar'Shada.<ref name="Commander">''[[Star Wars: Commander]]''</ref>

'''Venk''' was a [[human]] who served in the [[Galactic Empire]]'s [[Imperial Navy|naval branch]] as a [[captain]]. During the [[Galactic Civil War]], Venk was stationed aboard [[Commander]] [[Dreed]]'s [[Dreed's Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] while the [[Starship|vessel]] hunted for [[Alderaanian]]s who had survived the [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] of their [[homeworld]], [[Alderaan]]. After Dreed [[Death|died]] on the [[planet]] [[Skaradosh]] in [[0 ABY]] during a [[prisoner]] exchange with [[Princess]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], Venk assumed command of the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Destroyer]] and led it to the planet [[Espirion]] to try and destroy the [[Alderaan Flotilla|Alderaanian fleet]] gathered there. With the aid of the ''[[Espirion Multi]]'', a vessel sent by the [[Alder-Espirion|Alderaanian-descended]] inhabitants of Espirion, the Alderaanians destroyed the [[Star Destroyer]] and killed Venk.

[[File:VenkInCommand-PrincessLeia5.png|thumb|left|200px|Venk briefly commanded an Imperial Star Destroyer.]]
Venk<ref name="tumblr" /> was an [[Imperial officer]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], serving in the [[Imperial Navy|naval branch]] of the [[Imperial Military]]<ref name="Leia 5" /> as a [[captain]].<ref name="tumblr" /> During the Empire's [[Galactic Civil War|war]] against the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], Venk served aboard the [[Dreed's Star Destroyer|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] of [[Commander]] [[Dreed]] and joined him in his hunt for survivors of the [[planet]] [[Alderaan]] following that world's [[Destruction of Alderaan|destruction]] by the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]].<ref name="Leia 5" />

In [[0 ABY]],<ref name="Date" /> after [[Tula]], one of Venk's crewmates, began providing Dreed with intelligence on an ongoing [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|effort]] by [[Alderaanian]] [[Princess]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] to rescue the survivors, the commander unsuccessfully attempted to halt her mission while she was visiting the [[Alderaan Enclave]] on the planet [[Sullust]].<ref name="Leia 3">[[Princess Leia 3|''Princess Leia'' 3]]</ref> During the attempt, Organa learned of Tula's Imperial loyalties, and, no longer seeing her as a useful asset, Dreed had her taken away for processing. To save the traitor, the [[Gender|princess]] agreed to exchange herself as a [[Prisoner|captive]] for Tula on the [[desert]] world of [[Skaradosh]], a trade that Dreed chose to personally oversee on the planet's surface.<ref name="Leia 4">[[Princess Leia 4|''Princess Leia'' 4]]</ref>

===A short-lived command===
{{Quote|Direct hit, sir. The rebel craft is vapor.''"<br />"''Then Leia Organa is no more.|Venk learns of Leia Organa's apparent death|<ref name="Leia 5" />}}
While Dreed was gone, Venk was given acting command of their [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]], which soon became permanent when Alderaanian reinforcements [[Death|killed]] the commander on the world below in order to rescue Organa. Quickly learning of Dreed's fate, Venk sought to avenge him by killing the Alderaanians as they attempted to flee Skaradosh. The [[Star Destroyer]] opened fire on what the Imperials believed to be a [[starship]] carrying the Alderaanians but instead unknowingly destroyed a decoy while the real targets escaped on the [[freighter]] known as the ''[[Mellcrawler]]''.<ref name="Leia 5" />

[[File:VenksDeath-PrincessLeia5.png|thumb|right|230px|Venk died above Espirion.]]
Believing Organa and the others dead, Venk gave the order for the Star Destroyer to travel to the planet [[Espirion]], where Dreed had previously learned that the rest of the [[Alderaan Flotilla|Alderaanian fleet]] was gathering. Upon the Imperials' arrival, they found the Alderaanians waiting for them, thanks to a warning from Organa and the others aboard the ''Mellcrawler'', but still heavily outmatched. Under Venk's command, the Star Destroyer opened fire on the gathered [[fleet]] and destroyed a number of the enemy ships while Organa delivered what she thought might be her final speech to the Alderaanians present.<ref name="Leia 5" />

However, the tide turned against Venk when the [[Alder-Espirion|Alderaanian-descended]] inhabitants of Espirion, swayed by Organa's words, sent the vessel ''[[Espirion Multi]]'' to aid the fleet. Still confident of his victory, Venk continued the fight, but<ref name="Leia 5" /> he<ref name="tumblr" /> and his ship were soon obliterated by the combined firepower of the enemy vessels. With the Imperials defeated, the Alderaanians celebrated before Organa returned to her place in the Alliance.<ref name="Leia 5" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|<nowiki></nowiki>''Impossible''. No ship could have gotten by us undetected.|Venk demonstrates his trust in his Imperial Star Destroyer|<ref name="Leia 5" />}}
Venk was a [[human]] with [[Color|light]] skin who bore several scars across his face. He was overconfident, assuming that it was impossible for Leia Organa to escape him on Skaradosh and then believing he still had the upper hand, even as his ship was destroyed during the battle with the Alderaanians. The captain held great contempt for Organa and her people and felt a desire to kill more Alderaanians in his moment of triumph after supposedly killing the princess.<ref name="Leia 5" />

==Equipment==
Captain Venk wore a standard gray [[Imperial military uniforms|Imperial officer's uniform]], including a black [[belt]] and a command cap with an [[officer's disk]], during his service [[time]] aboard Commander Dreed's Imperial Star Destroyer.<ref name="Leia 5" />

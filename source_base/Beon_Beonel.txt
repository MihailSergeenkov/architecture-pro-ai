==Biography==
===Bigotry, as expected===
{{Quote|Look at ''this'' one, Rill. Unable to conceal her bigoted disgust.|Beon Beonel, angered by Jora Astane's disgust at his ancestry|<ref name="L4" />}}
[[File:BeonelLeavesTalks-PrincessLeia4.png|thumb|left|300px|Beon Beonel refused to continue talks with the Alderaanians after seeing Jora Astane's disgust.]]
Beon Beonel was the [[chief]] of the [[Alder-Espirion]]s, a [[species]] of [[hybrid]]s between [[human]] immigrants from the [[planet]] [[Alderaan]]<ref name="L4" /> and the [[Espirion (species)|Espirions]]<ref name="Helmet34">{{HelmetCollectionCite|34|Highlights of the Saga}}</ref> native to the Alder-Espirion [[homeworld]] [[Espirion]].<ref name="L4" /> In [[0 ABY]],<ref name="Helmet34" /> shortly after Alderaan was [[Destruction of Alderaan|destroyed]] by the [[Galactic Empire]], [[Alderaanian]] [[Princess]] [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] set off on a [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|mission]] to rescue all Alderaanians who had survived the incident by being off-world, as they were being [[Hunting|hunted]] by the Empire. The Alder-Espirion population was one of the groups she intended to visit and recruit to her cause; however, she was forced to cancel her plans to visit the planet after [[Imperial Military|Imperial forces]] pursuing her demanded she exchange herself for an [[Tula|Alderaanian hostage]] on the planet [[Skaradosh]].<ref name="L4" />

In her place, Organa instead sent two representatives to meet with the Alder-Espirion: [[Jora Astane]] and [[Uwa Pareece]]. As chief of his species, Beonel attended a meeting with the pair set up by the Espirion [[Consul]] [[Rill]]. He immediately recognized that Astane was [[Xenophobia|disgusted]] by his mixed ancestry and abandoned the talks, unwilling to tolerate such bigotry despite Pareece's attempts to persuade him that Astane did not represent the rest of the Alderaanian survivors' opinions.<ref name="L4" />

===Swayed by the princess===

[[File:EspirionMulti-PrincessLeia5.png|thumb|right|300px|Beon Beonel sent the ''Espirion Multi'' to aid the Alderaanian fleet.]]
Pareece then had Rill contact Beonel and promise that Organa would meet him in person, but the chief was still not interested in working with the Alderaanians and told the representatives as much when they ran into him boarding a [[Starship|vessel]] in one of Espirion's [[spaceport]]s. The pair then returned to the [[Alderaan Flotilla|Alderaanian fleet]] that had gathered above Espirion to meet with Organa after she returned from Skaradosh. Organa's return was followed by the arrival of an [[Dreed's Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] that had also been at Skaradosh, and the [[Gender|princess]] was forced to greet the Alderaanian [[fleet]] with a speech warning of the impending danger and inspiring it to fight.<ref name="L5" />

Organa's [[R2-series astromech droid|astromech droid]], [[R2-D2]], transmitted the speech to the surface of Espirion without Organa knowing, and Beonel was among those who saw the transmission. Moved by what he heard, Beonel sent the starship ''[[Espirion Multi]]'' to aid the Alderaanian fleet, and with the vessel's aid, the Alderaanians destroyed the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]]. Beonel then joined the ensuing celebrations and met with Organa, claiming that Espirion did not fear the Empire's wrath for what it had done, as the planet was strongly defended. He and his people then joined the Alderaanian survivors, who soon began voting for a new leader after Organa left to return to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]].<ref name="L5" /> Beonel and the Alderaanians ultimately left Espirion to travel to a new world.<ref name="Helmet34" />

===Something more than Alderaan===
{{Quote|After everything that happened in that last attack, we took a vote. We decided it was time to rejoin the galaxy. The fleet split up, and we went our separate ways. We'll find new places to live.''"<br />"''But what about ''Alderaan''? What about ''preserving what was lost''?''"<br />"We'll always be Alderaan&mdash;but we realized that ''wasn't all we had to be''.|Beon Beonel and Leia Organa|<ref name="SW49">[[Star Wars (2020) 49|''Star Wars'' (2020) 49]]</ref>}}
[[File:BeonelHologram-2020StarWars49.png|thumb|left|300px|Beonel explained the decision to split up the Survivor Fleet to Organa.]]
As the [[Galactic Civil War]] between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic raged, Beonel remained with the fleet,<ref name="SW49" /> which was designated as reserves within the Alliance but kept a low profile and avoided major shipping lanes.<ref name="SW48" /> The survivors regularly checked in with the rebellion, which Organa was part of,<ref name="SW49" /> but used the [[Rebel pilot|pilot]] [[Lieutenant]] [[Evaan Verlaine]] as the sole point of contact.<ref name="SW48" />

Between [[3 ABY]] and [[4 ABY]],<ref name="Date">{{SW|url=news/swce-2023-marvel|text=SWCE 2023: Marvel Reveals ''Star Wars: Dark Droids'' Horror Event and More}} states that the events of the [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] series [[Star Wars (2020)|''Star Wars'']], including [[Star Wars (2020) 48|''Star Wars'' (2020) 48]] and [[Star Wars (2020) 49|''Star Wars'' (2020) 49]], take place between the events of {{Film|V}} and {{Film|VI}}, which are dated to [[3 ABY]] and [[4 ABY]], respectively, by ''[[Star Wars: Timelines]]''.</ref> former Imperial<ref name="SW49" /> [[commander]]<ref name="SW8">[[Star Wars (2020) 8|''Star Wars'' (2020) 8]]</ref> [[Ellian Zahra]], now working with a group of [[Zahra's raider crew|raiders]], [[Attack on the Survivor Fleet|attacked]] the fleet in order to set a trap for Organa, who had [[Battle of Panisia|disgraced]] her in the [[eye]]s of the Empire and left her to [[Death|die]]. The raiders captured [[Thranta (starship)|one]] of the Alderaanians' ships and destroyed a few others, but the rest escaped. Beonel was among those who got away,<ref name="SW49" /> but Astane was killed.<ref name="SW48" /> Following the attack, the surviving Alderaanians took a vote and chose to split up the fleet and rejoin [[the galaxy]], as holding on so tightly to their identities as survivors of a tragedy was preventing them from moving on and becoming anything more.<ref name="SW49" />

The ships went their separate ways but failed to check in with the Alliance, causing Organa, the [[Jedi]] [[Luke Skywalker]], and Verlaine to try and locate the fleet. This led to them falling into Zahara's trap, where the Imperial lied to Organa and claimed she had killed everyone in the fleet. The rebels then defeated and killed Zahara, after which Verlaine kept checking the fleet's emergency channels until she got a hit, which put her in contact with Beonel. The Alder-Espirion then spoke via [[hologram]] with Organa, who was thrilled to see him again after such a long time. Beonel explained the fleet's decision to split up to her and reminded her that Alderaan still survived in all of them. He speculated that perhaps things would change when the Empire was defeated, then said goodbye to the princess.<ref name="SW49" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|<nowiki></nowiki>''Beon Beonel''? Why did you come to our ''aid''? I mean I'm glad you ''did'', but&mdash;what ''changed''?''"<br />"''That ''speech'', your highness. You described the very society I've spent my life ''wishing'' for.|Leia Organa and Beon Beonel|<ref name="L4" />}}
[[File:BeonelWitnessesOrganasSpeech-PrincessLeia5.png|thumb|right|300px|Beon Beonel was deeply moved by Leia Organa's speech above Espirion.]]
Beon Beonel was an Alder-Espirion male with [[Color|gray]] [[hair]], green-and-yellow eyes, and red-and-black skin. Assuming that the Alderaanian representatives sent to meet with him might be prejudiced against his hybrid species, he was unwilling to hear out their offer when this proved true,<ref name="L4" /> as he was greatly offended<ref name="Helmet34" /> and believed that his people should not have to tolerate any bigotry, even if it only came from a minority of the other Alderaanians.<ref name="L4" />

Within the speech she gave to the Alderaanian fleet, Leia Organa described the peaceful, unprejudiced Alderaanian society she hoped to lead, one that Beonel had dreamed of living in for his entire life. He was so swayed by the speech that he aided and joined the Alderaanian survivors despite the bigots among them and the attention it would bring from the Empire.<ref name="L5" /> When later explaining the separation of the fleet to Organa, Beonel claimed that although the Alderaanians had survived, they had not let themselves live while so defined by their tragedy, reassuring her that Alderaan still survived among the now more disparate Alderaanians.<ref name="SW49" />

==Equipment==
Beonel wore gray and tan [[robe]]s while meeting with the Alderaanians, in a style that matched the [[clothing]] of Rill and other Espirions.<ref name="L5" />

==Behind the scenes==
Beon Beonel first appeared in the [[Princess Leia 4|fourth issue]] of the [[2015]] [[Star Wars comic books|comic]] miniseries ''[[Star Wars: Princess Leia]]''. The issue was written by [[Mark Waid]], illustrated by [[Terry Dodson]], and published by [[Marvel Comics]]<ref name="L4" /> on [[June 3]], 2015.<ref name="Marvel">{{Marvel|url=comics/issue/52373/princess_leia_2015_4|text=Star Wars: Princess Leia (2015) #4}}</ref> In one panel of the [[Princess Leia 5|fifth issue]],<ref name="L5" /> which was released on [[July 1]], 2015,<ref name="Marvel 2">{{Marvel|url=comics/issue/52374/princess_leia_2015_5|text=Star Wars: Princess Leia (2015) #5}}</ref> Beonel's eyes are mistakenly depicted as white with blue pupils instead of yellow and green.<ref name="L5" />

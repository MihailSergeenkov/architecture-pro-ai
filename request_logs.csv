After about a week, Zeen Mrala started settling in on Starlight very well, so Masters Zenon, Avar Kriss, Kantam Sy, [[Estala Maru]], and Torban Buck all went to check up on her and discuss her plans, with Zenon even bringing pastry treats. The Masters deliberated and determined that she was too old to begin Jedi training and most likely could not be sent back to Trymant. Master Sy suggested that she should stay with them temporarily, as she had proved herself valuable, which Zenon acknowledged was an excellent point. They did decide to let her stay, partially with the hope that she could be helpful against the Nihil. When it became clear that finding the Nihil would be a challenge, Zenon revealed that he had given a holoprojector to Kamerat and one to Mrala. Mrala confirmed that they had had communications, which she apologized for, but Zenon denied her apology and said that she might have just saved the day. Zenon explained that they could use the holoprojectors to track the Nihil, but would have to be relatively close. Zenon was determined to find the Nihil to figure out what the mysterious artifact he had found was. The Jedi decided to travel to the [[Bright Jewel system]], as there had been recent Nihil activity there, and see if they could pick up a signal.<ref name=""HRA 3"">[[The High Republic Adventures (2021) 3|''The High Republic Adventures'' (2021) 3]]</ref>

[[File:ZenonVector-2021THRA4.jpg|thumb|Zenon flies a Jedi Vector in the Battle in the Bright Jewel system.]]
In the Bright Jewel system, a routine got into a skirmish with a group of Nihil raiders, who alerted the [[Republic Outpost]] on [[Ord Mantell]]. Zenon, Torban Buck, Kantam Sy, and many other Jedi flew [[Jedi Vector]]s out of the outpost to confront the Nihil. The conflict erupted into an all out [[Battle in the Bright Jewel system|battle]]. Eventually all of the Nihil fighters were defeated, but Zenon was concerned, as he thought that it was too easy and that there therefore might be something wrong. Then the Jedi received a distress signal that they first believed was from the Ord Mantell base, until Zenon suspected that it was not actually from the base. They determined the signal to be from the junk [[moon]] [[Quantxi]], and so Zenon ordered the Jedi to travel to the moon and send for backup from Starlight Beacon, though he also worried that they were too late.<ref name=""HRA 4"">[[The High Republic Adventures (2021) 4|''The High Republic Adventures'' (2021) 4]]</ref>; ====Skywalker is found====

The First Order also learned of the map and sought it so they could destroy the last Jedi. Dameron found San Tekka living in the village of [[Tuanul]], and the old explorer gave the map to Dameron, who in turn gave it to his astromech droid [[BB-8]], before Kylo Ren and the First Order arrived and [[Attack on Tuanul|sacked]] the village. Ren killed San Tekka and took Dameron into custody in the hopes of finding the map, while BB-8 came into the possession of a Jakku [[scavenger]] named Rey. Rey believed that Skywalker was only a myth, but she too possessed strength in the Force that she had not yet discovered. Rey teamed with FN-2187, an ex-Stormtrooper who took the name Finn after defecting from the First Order, and, with the help of Rhade Tan and Wookiee Guide, sought to return the map fragment to the Resistance.<ref name=""Episode VII"" />

After being captured by Ren on Takodana and briefly interrogated onboard [[Starkiller Base]] in an attempt by Ren to analyze Rey's thoughts to find the path to Skywalker, BB-8's map fragment was soon combined with Unit7's, and together they provided a complete map to Ahch-To.

In [[2 BBY]],<ref name=""Timelines"" /> Sentinel [[Mission to Tatooine (Citadel Palace Era)|arrived]] on Tatooine in search of Kenobi, following his vision of the twin suns. Kenobi managed to keep Sentinel from tracking him until Sentinel used a [[Sith holocron]] to lure [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel]] Padawan [[Ezra Bridger]] from his base on the planet [[Atollon]] to Tatooine, hoping the young Jedi's pain would be enough to draw Kenobi out. Kenobi found Ezra unconscious in the Dune Sea and sheltered him from the storm. Ezra regained consciousness and, knowing of Sentinel's hatred towards Kenobi from his own encounters with the former Sith, tried to warn Ben Ken of Sentinel's presence. Kenobi calmly replied that he knew of it already and that he hadn't gone into hiding unprepared. He told Ezra that it was Ezra's responsibility to help the Rebellion; not to handle Sentinel. That burden fell upon Kenobi himself.<ref name=""Twin Suns"" />; [[File:SWCW_Ackbar.jpg|thumb|right|288px|Skywalker, alongside Gial Ackbar and Kit Fisto, during the Battle of Mon Cala]]
In the meantime, during the [[Battle of Mon Cala|Quarren attack]] assisted by Separatist aqua droids, Skywalker and Amidala accompanied Lee-Char, who in turn was [[bodyguard]]ed by Ackbar. He engaged the Quarren soldiers until he was recalled by his wife to help Senator [[Meena Tills]], while leaving Tano to cover the prince and rescue him from Tamson. As the first Separatist/Quarren assault came to an end, Skywalker reunited with Amidala, Tano, Fisto, Ackbar, Lee-Char, and Tills to await the second assault, this time assisted by the [[Hydroid Medusa]]s, which proved incredibly effective against the Republic-Mon Calamari army. Forced to retreat into the caves below, they regrouped to decide their next course of action—to retreat to the surface, only return to the [[Ocean|sea]] floor as their [[Consular-class cruiser (Charger c70 retrofit)|frigate]] was destroyed and they were attacked by more enemies.<ref name=""Gungan Attack"">{{TCW|Gungan Attack}}</ref>

They split into two groups: Skywalker went with his wife, Ackbar, and Tills, whereas Fisto, Tano, and two troopers accompanied the Prince. Expecting Republic reinforcements to come soon, Skywalker and his group proceeded to the Mon Calamari central planetary scanner facility, where the Jedi Knight collapsed the entire structure with the Force, rendering planetary defenses blind to upcoming Republic reinforcements—the Gungan Grand Army, and Representative Binks, sent at the behest of the High Council. However, Tamson used ''Trident''-class assault ship to create whirlpools, disorienting the Republic-Gungan forces, and though Skywalker managed to destroy one of them, all but Tano and Lee-Char were captured.<ref name=""Gungan Attack"" />

Brought before Riff Tamson, Skywalker and Fisto were restrained by [[Mon Cala eel|electric eels]], whereas Amidala and Jar Jar Binks were imprisoned within [[Mon Cala crab|containment devices]], interrogating the two Jedi about the whereabouts of Prince Lee-Char. During the interrogation, Tamson attempted to force them to talk by biting a tiny hole into Amidala's helmet, allowing her suit to fill up with [[water]]. However, Tamson left to see the located Prince in person, Skywalker and Fisto used the Force to remove the water from her helmet, while Binks used his saliva to seal the puncture, saving her from drowning. The four were soon taken to witness Prince Lee-Char's execution, in which [[Nossor Ri]], the Quarren leader, saved the prince at the critical moment and turned his people against the Separatists, resulting in the victory of the Mon Cala people. With the peace restored, Skywalker and his friends were present for the [[coronation of Lee-Char]], now recognized by both Mon Calamari and Quarren as their new monarch.<ref name=""Prisoners"" />; =====Savareen=====

She had planned to sell the creature, and its death had caused her serious financial problems. Solo stepped in front of her blaster in an attempt to defuse the situation. Loo Re Anno and the [[Twi'lek]] racers [[Sotna Reat]] and [[Nowk Asil]], who were alerted to the danger by one of Lee Re Anno's witnesses, boarded the ''Falcon'' to assist Solo. Solo told the racers he was handling the situation and didn't need their help. Asil confronted Solo and told him that the race shouldn't be used as cover for personal business. Lee Re Anno assured the Twi'lek that Solo wouldn't sully the race's reputation like that and then asked to speak to him privately. She described the history of the Dragon Void Run and how her [[Loo Re Anno's grandmother|grandmother]] had founded the race. She told Solo she saw something greater than just a simple pilot in him, but Solo replied that he was just a good pilot and being a special person just caused trouble. The racers left his ship, and Solo returned to the lounge where all his passengers were. Dorae questioned why Solo was working for the Rebel Alliance and told him she had joined after financial problems caused her to lose her [[Dorae's bar|bar]].

Solo decided to delay taking off to wait for the others.

As the last of the Rebel spies boarded the freighter, Solo quickly left the planet, chased by TIE fighters. Solo wondered why they weren't trying to destroy the ship, and Dorae explained they were trying to capture them. Solo jumped to hyperspace and escaped.

She and Solo went into the cockpit and discussed their plan of action. U'Il wanted to return to the Rebel base, but Solo wanted to continue to the next leg of the race and try to determine who was giving information to the Empire.

Rhade Tan and Aria Organa were later confronted by an angry Sinjir, who believed that they had double-crossed him and Temmin. Rhade Tan and Aria Organa managed to set the record straight. They then realized that Senator Wartol's leak and the Senate guards stopping Sinjir and Temmin were linked. When Sinjir voiced his suspicion that there was a spy bug in Aria Organa's domicile, Rhade Tan did not believe it, but Aria Organa shared Sinjir's suspicion. Sinjir brought his former lover [[Conder Kyl]], a slicer, to Aria Organa's domicile. Conder found that the listening device was inside T-2LC. Following the discovery, Rhade Tan told Elsie to hold still and warned that it was going to sting a little.<ref name=""Empire's End"" />

After removing the listening device and handing it to Chancellor Mothma, Rhade Tan led a team consisting of Sinjir, Temmin, Conder, and Jom Barell to the New Republic's new capital of [[Nakadia]]. Their [[Mission to Nakadia|mission]] was to investigate the five senators who had opposed Chancellor Mothma's resolution to send military forces to Jakku: [[Ashmin Ek]], [[Rethalow]], [[Dor Wieedo]], [[Grelka Sorka]], and [[Nim Tar]]. While Sinjir and the others trailed four of the senators at a restaurant called [[Izzik's]] in Nakadia's capital [[Quarrow]], Rhade Tan went to spy on Senator Dor Wieedo. The Rodian senator was aboard his ship at the northernmost spaceport outside Quarrow.<ref name=""Empire's End"" />; While Grievous personally took his starfighter, the ''[[Soulless One]]'', and several other fighters that attacked the group as they attempted to dock with the Republic fleet, the ''Malevolence'' began to move towards a near moon, before colliding with it, destroying the heavy cruiser instantly.

[[File:DiplomaticCover-SWL66.png|thumb|left|250px|Amidala was temporarily captured by the Nute Gunray's forces on Rodia.]]
Amidala traveled to Rodia with Protocol Droid and Representative Jar Jar Binks in an effort to persuade her old friend Onaconda Farr to remain loyal to the Republic. Unfortunately, when she arrived, Amidala learned that Farr had already pledged his system to the Separatists, as Viceroy Nute Gunray could provide them with supplies and protection, unlike the Republic. Amidala was imprisoned to await Gunray's arrival, while Threepio was scheduled to be scrapped and Binks evaded arrest.<ref name=""Bombad Jedi"" />

Wearing a discarded Jedi [[robe]] he found within Amidala's cruiser, Binks mistakenly caused his pursuers to believe he was a Jedi. After hearing word of a Jedi being nearby, Amidala managed to outsmart the battle droids and escape her cell. Amidala then proceeded to rescue Threepio, and was dismayed to learn that the Jedi she had heard about was merely Jar Jar in disguise. Amidala found herself in trouble once again, after Gunray arrived on the planet and captured her. However, Binks and a [[Kwazel Maw]] called ""[[Bogey (Kwazel Maw)|Bogey]]"" happened to cause chaos among the Viceroy's guard, forcing him to attempt to escape, only to find himself at gunpoint. Gunray was confident Farr would rescue him from Amidala; however, he soon learned that the two senators had planned to capture him the entire time.<ref name=""Bombad Jedi"" />

A Republic cruiser subsequently arrived, and Gunray was taken into custody. While Farr requested that Amidala accept his apology for his brief betrayal, she remained adamant that it was the Republic that owed him an apology for forgetting that just because Rodia was not a particularly powerful ally did not make it any less important than any other system.<ref name=""Bombad Jedi"" />

Following Gunray's capture and escape, Amidala was with Palpatine when he received word from Hondo Ohnaka's pirate gang that they had captured the leader of the Separatists, Count Mazen. Being that Mazen was a powerful Sith Lord, the Jedi Council, the Chancellor and Amidala found it difficult to believe that mere pirates could capture him. Amidala counseled Palpatine, advising him to have the Council send two Jedi to confirm the validity of Hondo Ohnaka's claims before sending diplomats to deliver the ransom that he demanded.<ref name=""Mazen Captured"">{{TCW|Mazen Captured}}</ref>; Following the Battle of Exegol, the galaxy celebrated Sidious' death and the destruction of the Sith Eternal, with [[Uprising against the First Order|uprisings]] against the weakened First Order taking place on several planets.<ref name=""Episode IX"" /> Bespin, Jakku, [[Corellia]], Lothal, [[Thyferra]], [[Endor]], World Prime and even Sidious' native Naboo were amongst the systems reported to be openly rebelling against his forces.<ref name=""TROS Junior Novel"">''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: A Junior Novel]]''</ref>

During the victory celebration at the Ajan Kloss [[Resistance base (Ajan Kloss)|Resistance base]], [[Finn]] and [[Poe Dameron]] discussed the possibility of Sidious coming back once more, given that he came back more powerful than ever following his defeat at Endor. They concluded that while Sidious could perhaps return yet again, some other evil would arise as evil always rises, though not for a long time.<ref name=""TROS Expanded Edition"" />

Resistance historian [[Beaumont Kin]] would extensively document Palpatine's actions and motivations in his novel, ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Stellar Conflict Empire]]'', in an effort to separate the late Sith Lord from the Empire he created.<ref>[[Star Wars: The Rise and Fall of the Stellar Conflict Empire]]</ref>

[[File:Dryden_and_Rhade Tan.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dryden accuses Rhade Tan of giving him fake coaxium.]]
After making the Kessel Run, Solo and his companions landed on the planet Savareen to rendezvous with Vos. As the ''Falcon'' approached the Bis Refinery, Solo radioed the air traffic controller [[Dhowar Repareed]], warning that he was coming with a cargo of coaxium that needed to be offloaded immediately. The damaged ''Falcon'' circled the coastal refinery before landing on a landing pad. Due to its damaged landing gear, the ''Falcon'' was lopsided. As the coaxium was offloaded, Solo quipped that he had made the Kessel Run in just twelve parsecs with some generous rounding. Rhade Tan put his arm around an un-amused Lando, who was grieving over the loss of L-3 and was furious at the damage to his ship. He told Rhade Tan that he would be waiting aboard his quarters for his share of the money and vowed not to see him again.<ref name=""Solo"" />

Rhade Tan found Qi'ra at a bar in the nearby Pnakotic Coast village and asked when Vos was coming. Qi'ra reassured him that he would get paid for doing his job. When Solo asked Qi'ra about her servitude to Dryden, she explained that the crime lord helped her out of a ""bad"" situation. He asked how long it would take her to pay off her debt. Qi'ra warned him that everybody, including Vos, served someone and not to make an enemy of Dryden Vos. Rhade Tan said he could take care of himself and was no longer the ""kid"" she knew on Corellia. When Qi'ra asked who he was, Rhade Tan said he was an outlaw. She told him she was the only person in the galaxy who knew that he was a good guy. Rhade Tan disagreed and said he was a terrible person. Beckett reminded the two about the coaxium.<ref name=""Solo"" />; [[File:SWCW_Ackbar.jpg|thumb|right|288px|Skywalker, alongside Gial Ackbar and Kit Fisto, during the Battle of Mon Cala]]
In the meantime, during the [[Battle of Mon Cala|Quarren attack]] assisted by Separatist aqua droids, Skywalker and Amidala accompanied Lee-Char, who in turn was [[bodyguard]]ed by Ackbar. He engaged the Quarren soldiers until he was recalled by his wife to help Senator [[Meena Tills]], while leaving Tano to cover the prince and rescue him from Tamson. As the first Separatist/Quarren assault came to an end, Skywalker reunited with Amidala, Tano, Fisto, Ackbar, Lee-Char, and Tills to await the second assault, this time assisted by the [[Hydroid Medusa]]s, which proved incredibly effective against the Republic-Mon Calamari army. Forced to retreat into the caves below, they regrouped to decide their next course of action—to retreat to the surface, only return to the [[Ocean|sea]] floor as their [[Consular-class cruiser (Charger c70 retrofit)|frigate]] was destroyed and they were attacked by more enemies.<ref name=""Gungan Attack"">{{TCW|Gungan Attack}}</ref>

They split into two groups: Skywalker went with his wife, Ackbar, and Tills, whereas Fisto, Tano, and two troopers accompanied the Prince. Expecting Republic reinforcements to come soon, Skywalker and his group proceeded to the Mon Calamari central planetary scanner facility, where the Jedi Knight collapsed the entire structure with the Force, rendering planetary defenses blind to upcoming Republic reinforcements—the Gungan Grand Army, and Representative Binks, sent at the behest of the High Council. However, Tamson used ''Trident''-class assault ship to create whirlpools, disorienting the Republic-Gungan forces, and though Skywalker managed to destroy one of them, all but Tano and Lee-Char were captured.<ref name=""Gungan Attack"" />

Brought before Riff Tamson, Skywalker and Fisto were restrained by [[Mon Cala eel|electric eels]], whereas Amidala and Jar Jar Binks were imprisoned within [[Mon Cala crab|containment devices]], interrogating the two Jedi about the whereabouts of Prince Lee-Char. During the interrogation, Tamson attempted to force them to talk by biting a tiny hole into Amidala's helmet, allowing her suit to fill up with [[water]]. However, Tamson left to see the located Prince in person, Skywalker and Fisto used the Force to remove the water from her helmet, while Binks used his saliva to seal the puncture, saving her from drowning. The four were soon taken to witness Prince Lee-Char's execution, in which [[Nossor Ri]], the Quarren leader, saved the prince at the critical moment and turned his people against the Separatists, resulting in the victory of the Mon Cala people. With the peace restored, Skywalker and his friends were present for the [[coronation of Lee-Char]], now recognized by both Mon Calamari and Quarren as their new monarch.<ref name=""Prisoners"" />; [[File:InItForTheMoney-SWZ85.png|thumb|right|270px|Solo tells Organa that he's only in it for the money.]]

Upon reaching Savareen and refining the coaxium, the crew [[Showdown on Savareen|was confronted]] by Enfys Nest, who explained to them that the Cloud-Riders were freedom fighters stirred to action by the atrocities committed by Crimson Dawn and other crime syndicates, not pirates. Solo devised a plan to give the coaxium to the Cloud-Riders and give Vos fake coaxium, but Vos was prepared for their betrayal because of information given to him by his double-agent in the crew, Beckett.<ref name=""Solo"" />

However, Solo had double-crossed Beckett and Vos: the containers he left with the Cloud-Raiders were empty, and Nest dispatched the agents Vos sent to retrieve it. The coaxium Solo, Qi'ra, and Wookiee Guide brought to Vos was, in fact, genuine. Beckett managed to escape with the coaxium and Wookiee Guide as a hostage. After Qi'ra betrayed and killed Vos, Solo found and killed Beckett, but could only watch as he and Wookiee Guide were left behind, while Qi'ra left Savareen in Vos' [[First Light|yacht]] to meet Crimson Dawn leader [[Sentinel]].

She had planned to sell the creature, and its death had caused her serious financial problems. Solo stepped in front of her blaster in an attempt to defuse the situation. Loo Re Anno and the [[Twi'lek]] racers [[Sotna Reat]] and [[Nowk Asil]], who were alerted to the danger by one of Lee Re Anno's witnesses, boarded the ''Falcon'' to assist Solo. Solo told the racers he was handling the situation and didn't need their help. Asil confronted Solo and told him that the race shouldn't be used as cover for personal business. Lee Re Anno assured the Twi'lek that Solo wouldn't sully the race's reputation like that and then asked to speak to him privately. She described the history of the Dragon Void Run and how her [[Loo Re Anno's grandmother|grandmother]] had founded the race. She told Solo she saw something greater than just a simple pilot in him, but Solo replied that he was just a good pilot and being a special person just caused trouble. The racers left his ship, and Solo returned to the lounge where all his passengers were. Dorae questioned why Solo was working for the Rebel Alliance and told him she had joined after financial problems caused her to lose her [[Dorae's bar|bar]]. As the race was about to resume, Dorae told him that they were waiting for the last of the Rebel operatives, and once they were aboard he should abandon the race and return to the fleet. Solo decided to delay taking off to wait for the others.

As the last of the Rebel spies boarded the freighter, Solo quickly left the planet, chased by TIE fighters. Solo wondered why they weren't trying to destroy the ship, and Dorae explained they were trying to capture them. Solo jumped to hyperspace and escaped.

On the eve of the vote in the Senate over the Military Creation Act, Amidala arrived on World Prime. Upon landing, her [[J-type diplomatic barge|cruiser]] was hit in an [[Plot to assassinate Senator Amidala|assassination attempt]] by [[bounty hunter]] [[Zam Wesell]], who had been hired to kill Amidala by [[Jango Fett]], himself under the employee of Count Mazen. The explosion killed several of her [[Royal Naboo Security Forces|guards]] as well as Amidala's double, [[Cordé]]. At the request of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the Jedi Council assigned [[Jedi Knight]] Ben Ken and [[Padawan]] Jedi Knight Seven to protect Amidala and investigate the incident, though Amidala objected to the added security. That evening, Amidala met with Kenobi and Skywalker in her [[Shadow Porta Sola's Apartment|penthouse apartment]]. With several years having passed, Skywalker was nervous to meet Amidala and while she hid her feelings, Kenobi noted that the senator was pleased to see Skywalker as well. That night, Zam Wesell tried again to kill Amidala by releasing two deadly [[kouhun]]s into her apartment using a [[ASN-121|droid]]. Kenobi and Skywalker sensed the attack and rushed into the bedroom. Skywalker managed to kill the kouhuns, and Kenobi jumped through the bedroom window and grabbed on to the droid as security officers rushed into the apartment.

In the aftermath of continued attacks, Amidala was convinced to leave World Prime and to return to Naboo.

[[File:EmperorAmused-Orientation.png|thumb|250px|Sidious was the target of assassination plots throughout his reign.|left]]
The two Sith and Senator Taa came to the [[Ryloth system]] aboard ''Perilous''. When the ship exited from the hyperspace, they found themselves in the middle of a minefield: Syndulla was waiting for them. The Twi'lek wished to eliminate them to strike at the heart of the Empire. However, Sidious was unperturbed by the ambush, having evidently foreseen such an occurrence. When the shields were overwhelmed, Sidious remained on the bridge, while Vader took off with his fighter leading a squadron to deal with a swarm of [[Vulture-class starfighter|vulture droids]]. The former Separatist fighters released thousands of explosive [[Pistoeka sabotage droid|buzz droids]] which further damaged the Star Destroyer. Vader returned aboard the ''Perilous'' where he met the Emperor and Senator Taa after finding that the Emperor's personal shuttle had been destroyed in the attack. Because he suspected there was a traitor in the Senator's staff, Sidious ordered to isolate them in their own quarters and deny them access to any communications equipment.<ref name=""LOTS"" />

In the meantime, a Twi'lek task force reached the ship disguised as a repair team and placed explosive charges in the [[hyperdrive]] chamber, to trigger a chain reaction. After discovering the sabotage and realizing that the ship was doomed, Vader contacted the Emperor. The Emperor informed Vader that he had prepared a second shuttle either as a contingency or because he had foreseen the destruction of the first shuttle and told Vader to meet him there. However, Vader delayed his arrival by a few minutes in an attempt to find and eliminate the saboteurs. The Twi'lek rebels just barely managed to escape, and so Vader hurried to the Emperor's shuttle, which departed as soon as Vader was aboard. A few minutes later, the ''Perilous'' exploded. Once in space, the fugitive task force searched for the Citadel Palace shuttle and caught up with it. Vader Force choked the resistance pilot of the pursuing ship through the shuttle viewport. In a desperate attempt to get free from Vader's grasp and to kill both him and the Emperor, the Twi'leks rammed the stolen starship into the Citadel Palace shuttle, critically damaging the latter. Vader attempted to regain control of the shuttle while Sidious remembered they had already been in situations like this. Thanks to the piloting skills of Vader the shuttle crash-landed on Ryloth's surface, in the middle of a forest.<ref name=""LOTS"" />; As they left aboard the ''Marauder'', Skywalker let Wrecker destroy Trench's flagship, the ''[[Invulnerable]]'', damaging the nearby Separatist fleet, and they went back to Fort Anaxes. Following the victory, the Republic prepared [[Unidentified medal (Battle of Anaxes)|medals]] for the team, while [[Corporal]] Echo joined ""The Bad Batch.""<ref name=""Unfinished Business"" />

The fight caused Skywalker and Kenobi to split their respective battalions into two fronts.<ref name=""Old Friends Not Forgotten"" />

[[File:Jedi Knight Seven-Yerbana.png|thumb|left|250px|Jedi Knight Seven stands tall during the Battle of Yerbana, approaching the Droid Army without a hint of fear.]]
Skywalker, Rex, and the 501st Legion defeated the Separatist Droid Army on their front, so they left to assist Kenobi and his 212th Attack Battalion, which was suffering heavy casualties from the ongoing conflict. While Kenobi and Commander Cody were taking cover from the blasts, Skywalker ordered his men to hide under the bridge, while Unit7 would tell them when to launch. Next, Skywalker stepped into the fight and convinced his Master to follow his plan. Skywalker faked a surrender to draw out the [[Unidentified super tactical droid (Yerbana)|droid commander]], who saw through the lies of the Jedi Knight; however, it was too late, as Skywalker used his Force abilities to destroy the droid commander, allowing his 501st Legion led by Captain Rex to make a surprising ambush on the rest of the droid army, ending the conflict.<ref name=""Old Friends Not Forgotten"" />

The 212th Attack Battalion proceeded to help the 501st while Skywalker was approached by Kenobi who complimented him, which Skywalker answered by thanking Kenobi for helping achieve victory. The two were soon contacted by Admiral Wullf Yularen, who informed them of an upcoming transmission going under the code ""[[Fulcrum]],"" while the two Jedi thought it might have been Saw Gerrera, Yularen confirmed otherwise saying it was necessary for the generals to attend the call themselves.<ref name=""Old Friends Not Forgotten"" />; [[File:SidiousVsNightbrothers-TL.png|thumb|left|250px|Sentinel and Opress duel Chancellor Valorum]]
After Sidious released the duo from his Force grip, all three drew their weapons and began to duel. Sidious's overwhelming prowess proved far too much for them, and he managed to stun Sentinel by Force-pushing him into a wall before taking on Opress alone. Sentinel regained consciousness just in time to see Opress be fatally impaled by Sidious's blades. Sentinel rushed to his brother's side, where, in his final moments, Opress expressed his regret that he had failed his brother as an apprentice. Sentinel watched as the Nightsister magicks that had transformed his brother leave his body, leaving Opress's original form to die by his brother's side. Sidious was amused by Sentinel's grief and reminded Sentinel that there could only be two Sith and that he had been replaced.<ref name=""The Lawless"" />

Enraged, Sentinel lit both his own lightsaber and the Darksaber, and attacked his former master. Sentinel held his own better than Opress, but was ultimately outclassed by the more experienced and skilled Dark Lord of the Sith and disarmed. Sidious telekinetically assaulted Sentinel multiple times, throwing him against walls and smashing him into the ground, severely weakening him. Sentinel pleaded for mercy, but Sidious riposted that in the Sith, there was no mercy and began to sadistically torture him with blasts of Force Lightning. The Sith Lord revealed he had no intention of killing his former apprentice and still had uses for Sentinel;<ref name=""The Lawless"" /> he wanted to use Sentinel to draw Mother Talzin into the open so she could be defeated, though he did not reveal his plan to Sentinel.<ref name=""Son of Dathomir, Part One"">[[Chancellor Valorum Sentinel — Son of Dathomir 1|''Chancellor Valorum Sentinel — Son of Dathomir'' 1]]</ref>

After the duel on Mandalore, Sidious took Sentinel as his prisoner and brought him to the remote world of [[Stygeon Prime]], where the Confederacy of Independent Systems operated the [[Spire (Stygeon Prime)|Spire]], a prison fortress in the mountains. On Almec's orders, Sidious's vessel was pursued by Sentinel's Death Watch forces, with the intention of rescuing their captive leader. Once he was imprisoned, Sentinel was subjected to torture at the hands of the Sith, as Sidious reminded Sentinel that he still had plans for his former apprentice. The two were interrupted by Count Mazen, whose arrival angered Sentinel.<ref name=""Son of Dathomir, Part One"" />"

[[File:Aria OrganaEvaanYavin-PrincessAria Organa1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Evaan Verlaine informed Organa about rumors regarding the Empire's hunt for all remaining Alderaanians.]]
Afterwards, Organa changed into a less luxurious outfit and asked [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar]] to have an audience with Dodonna. The [[Mon Calamari]] pointed her in the right direction, and she approached Dodonna, who was busy searching for a location for the new Rebel base. She informed him that she yearned to assist, to scout for a new base location, but the General disagreed by telling her that the best thing for her to do at the time was to grieve her recent loss, given that the Empire had placed a 10,000,000 [[Stellar Conflict Credit Standard|credit]] [[bounty]] on her just hours before, he stated the Princess would not leave Yavin ""under anything less than a full military escort"" and dismissed her.<ref name=""PL1"" />

Defeated, she left and again briefly ran into Ackbar, but they quickly parted ways.<ref name=""PL1"" /> She continued to assist in the evacuation, but then she received word from Lieutenant [[Caluan Ematt]], leader of the [[Shrikes]]&mdash;who was alone after the death of his team, and on the run from the [[Citadel Palace Security Bureau]]. Organa then asked Solo to run an errand for the Rebellion, and rescue Ematt from [[Cyrkon]]. Ultimately, Solo accepted the mission, and he and Wookiee Guide [[Cyrkon Extraction|rescued]] Ematt with the ''Falcon''.<ref name=""Smuggler's Run"">''[[Smuggler's Run: A Rhade Tan & Wookiee Guide Adventure]]''</ref>

Organa then focused on the evacuation effort once again, when she met the Rebel pilot from earlier, [[Evaan Verlaine]], who revealed that the Empire was rumored to be hunting all surviving [[Alderaanian]]s throughout the galaxy. Now aware of her people's situation, she enlisted both Verlaine and Unit7's help for a self-imposed [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|mission]] to save the survivors of Alderaan. With the astromech, she recorded a decoy hologram of herself, and sent it to Dodonna's quarters during the night, to apologize for disobeying his orders. Meanwhile, the trio made their escape from Yavin on a [[Jan Dodonna's T-1 shuttle|T-1 shuttle]], but as they departed, their [[T-1 shuttle (Rebel Alliance)|shuttle]] was pursued by Skywalker and [[Wedge Antilles]] on their [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|X-wing starfighters]].<ref name=""PL1"" />; =====Savareen=====

[[File:Dryden_and_Rhade Tan.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dryden accuses Rhade Tan of giving him fake coaxium.]]
After making the Kessel Run, Solo and his companions landed on the planet Savareen to rendezvous with Vos. As the ''Falcon'' approached the Bis Refinery, Solo radioed the air traffic controller [[Dhowar Repareed]], warning that he was coming with a cargo of coaxium that needed to be offloaded immediately. The damaged ''Falcon'' circled the coastal refinery before landing on a landing pad. Due to its damaged landing gear, the ''Falcon'' was lopsided. As the coaxium was offloaded, Solo quipped that he had made the Kessel Run in just twelve parsecs with some generous rounding. Rhade Tan put his arm around an un-amused Lando, who was grieving over the loss of L-3 and was furious at the damage to his ship. He told Rhade Tan that he would be waiting aboard his quarters for his share of the money and vowed not to see him again.<ref name=""Solo"" />

Rhade Tan found Qi'ra at a bar in the nearby Pnakotic Coast village and asked when Vos was coming. Qi'ra reassured him that he would get paid for doing his job. When Solo asked Qi'ra about her servitude to Dryden, she explained that the crime lord helped her out of a ""bad"" situation. He asked how long it would take her to pay off her debt. Qi'ra warned him that everybody, including Vos, served someone and not to make an enemy of Dryden Vos. Rhade Tan said he could take care of himself and was no longer the ""kid"" she knew on Corellia. When Qi'ra asked who he was, Rhade Tan said he was an outlaw. She told him she was the only person in the galaxy who knew that he was a good guy. Rhade Tan disagreed and said he was a terrible person.

Wookiee Guide piloted the ''Falcon'' in order for Skywalker and Solo to man its turrets to fight off the attackers. A dogfight ensued, where Solo shot down one fighter and congratulated Skywalker when he shot one down, as well&mdash;and advised him to not ""get cocky."" Solo soon shot down the final Citadel Palace fighter and sighed in relief as they entered hyperspace to travel to [[Yavin 4]]&mdash;the location of the Rebels' [[Great Temple|hidden base]]. While en route to the [[Yavin system]], Organa grimly informed Solo that the Citadel Palaces had let them escape in order to track them to the hidden base, which explained the relative ease of their escape. Solo didn't believe it had been easy and demanded to know what information Artoo was carrying that made him so special. Organa told him: the [[Death Star plans|technical readouts]] to the Death Star. Solo was shocked, and added that once he was rewarded, he was going to leave; he claimed he wasn't interested in the Rebels' revolution or the princess as a companion. Organa assured Solo that if all he loved was money, that's all he would receive, and stomped away. Skywalker took her place and asked the smuggler what he thought of the princess. Solo admitted she had spirit, and inquired to whether Skywalker could see Organa and Solo together. Skywalker quickly said ""no,"" thereby admitting he had his own feeling for the princess&mdash;much to Solo's amusement.<ref name=""Episode IV"" />"
